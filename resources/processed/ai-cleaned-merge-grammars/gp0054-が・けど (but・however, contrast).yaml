details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: teineigo (polite)
  particle-syntactic-function: conjunctive
  particle-pragmatic-function: discourse marker
  usage-context: general conversation
  function: connects two clauses, expressing contrast, concession, or a preliminary statement
  nuance: Indicates a mild contrast or reservation, often used to soften a statement or introduce background
    information. 'が' is generally more formal and neutral, while 'けど' is more casual. 'けれども' is a formal
    version of 'けど', often used in writing or polite speech.
  grammatical-role: Conjunction connecting clauses.
etymology: The particle 「が」 originally served a broader function, indicating the subject of a sentence.
  Over time, it evolved to also express contrast or connection between clauses, leading to its use as
  'but' or 'however'. This conjunctive function highlights the information following 「が」 as being somehow
  distinct or noteworthy in relation to what precedes it. 「けど」 is a shortened, more casual form of 「けれども」
  (keredomo). 「けれども」 itself is generally understood to derive from 係る (kakaru, 'to concern, to relate
  to') + ども (domo), a conjunctive particle expressing concession, eventually contracting to けれど and then
  けど. Thus, the original sense conveyed 'though it relates to' or 'although it is concerned with'. 「けれども」
  originates from the classical Japanese expression 「かくあれども」 (kaku aredomo), meaning 'though it is so'
  or 'even if it is thus'. 「かく」 (kaku) means 'thus' or 'in this way', 「あれ」 is the continuative form of
  the classical verb 「あり」 (ari), meaning 'to be', and 「ども」 is an old concessive particle. Over time, these
  elements fused and evolved into the modern 「けれども」, maintaining its core meaning of concession or contrast.
  The 'も' component adds a sense of inclusiveness or acceptance of the preceding statement, reinforcing
  the 'even though' aspect.
writeup: |-
  「が」, 「けど」, and 「けれども」 are versatile conjunctive particles used to connect two clauses. While often translated as "but" or "however," they each carry distinct nuances in formality and usage. They all function by highlighting an initial piece of information (A) and then presenting additional information (B) which may be contrasting, concessive, or simply supplementary.

  **「が」** is generally the most formal and neutral among the three. It can simply connect two sentences for stylistic reasons, even if they don't strongly contrast. It primarily indicates that while the first clause is true, there is more information to follow in the second clause. This allows 「が」 to function as a neutral connective, merely signaling a shift or continuation of thought, rather than a strong opposition. Using 「が」 is considered somewhat formal or direct in its assertion that additional information exists.

  **「けど」** is the most casual form. It functions similarly to 「が」, often conveying a sense of "while thinking about A, B." When 「けど」 follows a な-adjective or a noun, the linking verb だ is required, forming 「だけど」. A significant feature of 「けど」 is that the phrase after it can often be omitted if its meaning is obvious from context or if the speaker wishes to imply something without explicitly stating it. This allows for a more subtle and nuanced communication style.

  **「けれども」** is more formal than 「けど」 and is often used in writing or more polite speech. It connects two clauses where the second clause often presents a contrast, an exception, or an additional piece of information that is significant or requires consideration, given the first clause. While broadly similar in meaning to 「けど」, 「けれども」 carries a more formal, polite, and sometimes literary tone.

  **Formality Scale**: In terms of formality, these conjunctions exist on a spectrum: Casual -> けど -> けども -> けれど -> けれども -> が -> Formal.

  When connecting to a な-adjective stem or a noun, 「だ」 is required before 「けど」 (e.g., 静かだけど, 学生だけど) and before 「けれども」 (e.g., 静かだけれども, 学生だけれども). In polite speech, 「ですけど」 and 「ですけれども」 can also be used. The ability to omit the subsequent clause is a common feature across all three, allowing for nuanced or reserved communication.
false_friends:
  - term: ところが
    meaning: Even so, However, Even though, But
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike 「が」, 「けど」, or 「けれども」, 「ところが」 often introduces an unexpected or surprising result that
      goes against expectations formed by the preceding statement. It emphasizes the unpredictability
      of the consequence, which the others do not necessarily do. 「が」, 「けど」, and 「けれども」 simply connect;
      「ところが」 signifies a reversal of expectation.
    grammar_point: ところが (unexpected contrast)
  - term: だが・ですが
    meaning: But, However, Nevertheless
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「だが」 (plain form) and 「ですが」 (polite form) are more formal and often used in writing or more
      serious speech contexts compared to 「が」, 「けど」, or 「けれども」. They tend to introduce a stronger sense
      of opposition or counter-argument than the simple connecting function of 「が」, 「けど」, or 「けれども」. They
      often introduce a rebuttal or a significant counterpoint.
    grammar_point: だが (but・however)
  - term: ものの
    meaning: Although, But, Even Though
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ものの」 implies a stronger sense of concession than 「が」, 「けど」, or 「けれども」, often used when the
      first clause would logically lead to a different outcome, but the second clause states the actual,
      unexpected result. It suggests a more significant discrepancy. 「が」, 「けど」, and 「けれども」 are neutral
      connectors; 「ものの」 emphasizes a strong, often surprising, concession.
    grammar_point: ものの (although・but)
  - term: くせに
    meaning: Even though, And yet, Despite
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「が」, 「けど」, or 「けれども」, 「くせに」 carries a strong sense of resentment, criticism, or disapproval.
      It implies that the action or state in the second clause is contrary to what one would expect given
      the first clause, and the speaker is annoyed or critical of this contradiction. 「が」, 「けど」, and 「けれども」
      are neutral; 「くせに」 is highly negative and judgmental.
    grammar_point: くせに (despite and yet)
  - term: のに
    meaning: Even though, Despite that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「が」, 「けど」, or 「けれども」, 「のに」 expresses a stronger sense of unexpectedness or dissatisfaction,
      often implying a logical contradiction or surprise, often with a tone of complaint or accusation.
      「が」, 「けど」, and 「けれども」 are simple connectors; 「のに」 conveys a sense of dismay or unfairness.
    grammar_point: のに (unexpected result)
  - term: ても
    meaning: Even if; even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 'While 「が」, 「けど」, and 「けれども」 introduce a simple contrast or preliminary statement, 「ても」 implies
      a concession: ''even if'' something is true, the following clause still occurs. It often suggests
      a condition that does not prevent an outcome.'
    grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
  - term: しかしながら
    meaning: However; nevertheless
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「しかしながら」 is a highly formal expression, primarily used in written language or very polite
      speech. It conveys a strong sense of 'however' or 'nevertheless' and is much more rigid and less
      conversational than 「が」, 「けど」, or 「けれども」.
    grammar_point: しかしながら (however, formal)
  - term: それなのに
    meaning: And yet; despite that
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「それなのに」 emphasizes a sense of dissatisfaction or surprise because something occurred contrary
      to expectations or logical consequences. It is stronger than a simple contrast made with 「が」, 「けど」,
      or 「けれども」 and often carries a negative emotional tone.
    grammar_point: それなのに (and yet・despite that)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing 「が」, 「けど」, and 「けれども」 with similar expressions, remember
  that these are generally neutral connectors that indicate a contrast or addition of information. When
  you want to convey a stronger sense of surprise, resentment, or concession, choose a different expression.
  For more casual situations, 「けど」 is suitable, while 「が」 and 「けれども」 offer increasing levels of formality.
  Each alternative carries specific nuances that enrich or alter the meaning of the connection between
  clauses.

          - この 本 は 長い です {けど}、とても 面白い です。
        english: This book is long, but it's very interesting.
        hint: While 「けど」 is common in casual speech and also means 'but', it can sometimes imply a more
          personal or softer nuance. We're looking for a more objective and neutral connection suitable
          for introducing a topic to a friend.

          - この 本 は 長い です {けれど も}、とても 面白い です。
        english: This book is long, but it's very interesting.
        hint: 「けれども」 is a more formal or literary way of saying 'but'. We're looking for a more direct
          and concise connection for a casual recommendation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 は 長い です。{しかし}、とても 面白い です。
        english: This book is long. However, it's very interesting.
        hint: 「しかし」 acts as a strong conjunction often used at the beginning of a sentence, emphasizing
          a more significant contrast or opposition than a neutral connector. We're looking for a softer,
          more direct connection.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 は 長い です。{です が}、とても 面白い です。
        english: This book is long. However, it's very interesting.
        hint: 「ですが」 implies a stronger, more definite opposition or counter-argument. While polite, it's
          not the best fit for simply softening a request. We're looking for a simple connective 'but'
          that lessens the impact of the interruption.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 は 長い {もの の}、とても 面白い。
        english: Although this book is long, it's very interesting.
        hint: 「ものの」 implies a stronger sense of concession or an unexpected outcome given the preceding
          clause. We're looking for a more neutral connector.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 は 長い {ところ が}、とても 面白い。
        english: This book is long, but unexpectedly, it's very interesting.

          connection of contrasting information.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 は 長い {の に}、とても 面白い。
        english: Even though this book is long, it's very interesting.
        hint: 「なのに」 implies a stronger sense of unexpectedness or dissatisfaction. We're looking for a
          neutral connection.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 は 長い {くせ に}、とても 面白い。
        english: Despite this book being long, it's very interesting. (with a negative nuance)
        hint: 「くせに」 carries a strong negative or critical connotation. We're looking for a neutral 'but'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 は 長く {て}、とても 面白い。
        english: This book is long, and very interesting.
        hint: Using the て-form connects clauses, often implying a sequence or cause-and-effect, or simply
          listing characteristics without emphasizing contrast. We're looking for a nuance of 'but'.
    scene: A student is recommending a book to their classmate, acknowledging its length but emphasizing
      its appeal.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「です」 maintains a polite-casual tone suitable for friends discussing hobbies. The
      contrast is presented neutrally, focusing on the book's attributes rather than strong personal feelings.
      The sentence structure is simple and direct. For example, 「長いんです」 uses the explanatory 'ん' to add
      a slight emphasis to the length, while still maintaining the friendly tone with 「です」.
    etymology: Using 「本」 for book and 「長い」 for long are straightforward applications of N5 vocabulary.
      The grammar point 「が」 here acts as a neutral connector, allowing the sentence to flow smoothly between
      the two descriptive clauses without strong emphasis on the contrast itself, which is typical of
      its usage at the N5 level for introductory sentence linking.
  - english: Excuse me, but what time is it now?

          - すみ ませ ん {けど}、今 何 時 です か。
        english: Excuse me, but what time is it now?
        hint: While 「けど」 also means 'but' and is common, 「が」 provides a slightly more neutral and formal
          tone, making the request more polite and less abrupt when addressing a stranger.
      - competing_japanese:
          - すみ ませ ん {けれど も}、今 何 時 です か。
        english: Excuse me, but what time is it now?
        hint: 「けれども」 is a slightly more formal or literary alternative to 「が」. Both are polite, but 「が」
          is often preferred for its directness in this type of polite inquiry.
      - competing_japanese:
          - すみ ませ ん {しかし}、今 何 時 です か。
        english: Excuse me, however, what time is it now?
        hint: 「しかし」 is a strong conjunctive adverb that typically starts a new sentence and introduces
          a significant contrast. It's too strong for a polite interruption like this. We're looking for
          a softer opening.
      - competing_japanese:
          - すみ ませ ん {です が}、今 何 時 です か。
        english: Excuse me, however, what time is it now?
        hint: 「ですが」 implies a stronger opposition or counter-argument. While polite, it's not the best
          fit for simply softening a request. We're looking for a simple connective 'but' that lessens
          the impact of the interruption.
      - competing_japanese:
          - すみ ませ ん {の に}、今 何 時 です か。
        english: Even though I'm sorry, what time is it now?
        hint: 「なのに」 expresses a strong sense of unexpectedness or dissatisfaction, which doesn't fit the
          context of a polite inquiry. We're looking for a neutral softening particle.
    scene: A man approaches a woman at a train station platform, needing to know the current time.
    register: formal
    setting: interrogative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「すみません」 followed by 「が」 is a common polite preamble to a request or question. The
      use of 「が」 here softens the directness of the question, implying 'I am sorry to bother you, but...'
      or 'Excuse me, (there's something I need to ask you)'. This politeness is crucial when addressing
      a stranger, making the interaction smoother and more respectful. For example, 「すみませんが」 softens the
      directness of the query 「何時ですか」.
    etymology: The use of 「すみません」 as an apology or polite lead-in is deeply ingrained in Japanese communication.
      Its combination with 「が」 in this context highlights how particles can subtly manage social interactions,
      making requests less intrusive. The historical development of 「が」 from a subject marker to a connective
      particle is demonstrated here in its role of linking the apology to the impending question without
      a strong logical opposition, but rather a gentle transition.

        english: Even though this bag is expensive, it's really cute, isn't it?
        hint: 「のに」 implies a stronger sense of unexpectedness or dissatisfaction, which doesn't quite
          fit the context of simply acknowledging a contrast in a friendly way. We're looking for a neutral
          'but'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この バッグ は 高く {て}、すごく 可愛い です ね。
        english: This bag is expensive, and it's really cute, isn't it?
        hint: Using the て-form connects clauses by listing characteristics or implying cause-and-effect,
          rather than emphasizing a contrast. We're looking for a nuance of 'but'.
    scene: Two friends are shopping together and one comments on a bag they see.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The use of 「です」 and 「ね」 makes this polite and conversational, suitable for friends discussing
      items. 「高いです」 (expensive) is directly contrasted with 「すごく可愛いですね」 (very cute, isn't it?), with 「が」
      serving as a neutral bridge. The sentence structure is simple and direct, conveying a mild observation
      and seeking agreement.
  - english: I tried my best, but I couldn't succeed.
    japanese:

        english: I tried my best, however, I couldn't succeed.
        hint: 「けれども」 is a slightly more formal or literary alternative. We're looking for a more direct
          and common way to state a factual outcome.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 一生 懸命 頑張り まし た。{しかし}、成功 でき ませ ん でし た。
        english: I tried my best. However, I couldn't succeed.
        hint: 「しかし」 acts as a strong conjunctive adverb, often used at the beginning of a sentence, emphasizing
          a more significant contrast or opposition. We're looking for a softer, more direct connection.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 一生 懸命 頑張っ た {の に}、成功 でき ませ ん でし た。
        english: Even though I tried my best, I couldn't succeed.
        hint: 「のに」 implies a stronger sense of regret or dissatisfaction with the outcome, which isn't
          necessarily conveyed by a neutral 'but'. We're looking for a simple connective 'but'.
    scene: A student is reporting the result of a difficult project to their teacher.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: apologetic
    nuance: The speaker uses the polite ます-form 「頑張りました」 (tried my best) and 「できませんでした」 (couldn't succeed),
      indicating a respectful tone suitable for addressing a teacher or superior. 「が」 provides a neutral
      transition from the effort to the unsuccessful outcome without expressing strong emotion like regret
      or blame, making it appropriate for a factual report.
  - english: Are you busy, but would you like to go to the concert with me?

        english: Are you busy, but would you like to go to the concert with me?
        hint: While 「けど」 is also polite, 「が」 provides a slightly more formal and considerate softening
          of the invitation, acknowledging the other person's potential inconvenience more subtly.
      - competing_japanese:
          - お 忙しい です か。{そして}、コンサート に ご 一緒 し ませ ん か。
        english: Are you busy? And, would you like to go to the concert with me?
        hint: 「そして」 connects two separate thoughts but does not imply the softening or consideration that
          「が」 offers, making the invitation less indirect and potentially less polite.
    scene: A colleague politely asks another colleague out to a concert, considering their schedule.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: persuasive
    nuance: The 「お」 prefix in 「お忙しい」 (busy) and the honorific 「ご一緒し」 (accompany) with 「ませんか」 (won't you?)
      show a high level of politeness suitable for colleagues. 「が」 softens the request by first acknowledging
      a potential inconvenience, making the invitation more considerate and less demanding. This is a
      common pattern in Japanese for polite inquiries or invitations where one anticipates a potential
      obstacle.
  - english: My younger brother is quiet, but he's very kind.

          for a slightly more neutral, standard connection.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 弟 は 静か {で}、とても 親切 です。
        english: My younger brother is quiet and very kind.
        hint: Using the て-form 「で」 simply lists characteristics without emphasizing a contrast. We're
          looking for a nuance of 'but'.
    scene: Someone is describing their sibling to a new friend they just met.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: This is a straightforward contrasting statement. The use of 「弟」 (younger brother) and the
      simple 「です」 indicate a casual, informative register, typical when talking about family to a peer.
      「静かです」 (quiet) and 「親切です」 (kind) are two distinct qualities linked by 「が」 to show a gentle contrast,
      implying that despite his quietness, kindness is also a prominent trait.

        english: I understand what you're saying, however...
        hint: 「けれども」 is also polite and can imply hesitation, but 「が」 here is often used to signal a polite
          reservation or unstated counterpoint.
      - competing_japanese:
          - おっしゃる こと は 分かり ます。{しかし}…
        english: I understand what you're saying. However...
        hint: 「しかし」 implies a stronger, more direct disagreement or counter-argument, which might be too
          blunt in this context where a polite, implied reservation is intended.
    scene: A manager listens to a subordinate's suggestion, but has a reservation they're expressing indirectly.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: This is a highly nuanced usage of 「が」 where the second clause is omitted. The use of honorific
      「おっしゃる」 (to say) and polite 「分かります」 (understand) indicates a formal setting and respect for the
      listener. The trailing 「が」 creates an implied continuation, signaling that while the speaker understands,
      they have a reservation, a problem, or a differing opinion that they are either hesitant to express
      directly or expect the listener to infer. This polite, indirect communication is very common in
      professional Japanese settings, especially when disagreeing with a superior.
  - english: That's a good idea, but there are still some issues that need to be resolved.
    japanese:

        english: That's a good idea, however, there are still some issues that need to be resolved.
        hint: 「けれども」 is a slightly more formal way to express contrast. 「が」 is more direct for introducing
          a point of consideration after a positive statement.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 良い 提案 です。{しかし}、まだ 解決 す べき 問題 が いく つ か あり ます。
        english: That's a good idea. However, there are still some issues that need to be resolved.
        hint: 「しかし」 creates a stronger break and emphasizes a more significant opposition. 「が」 allows
          for a smoother, more continuous flow when introducing a reservation politely.
    scene: A team leader is giving feedback on a new proposal during a business meeting.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The use of 「です」 and 「あります」 maintains a polite professional tone. 「が」 functions to gently introduce
      a reservation or a point of consideration after a positive statement, without sounding overly confrontational.
      This is typical in business discussions where feedback needs to be constructive and polite, allowing
      for a smooth transition from agreement to a point of concern.
  - english: The data shows an increase in sales, but further analysis is required.
    japanese:
      - データ は 売上 の 増加 を 示し て い ます {が}、さらなる 分析 が 必要 です。

        english: The data shows an increase in sales, however, further analysis is required.
        hint: 「けれども」 is a slightly more formal or literary alternative, often used in written reports.
          「が」 provides a more concise and commonly used connection for presenting findings orally or in
          less formal academic contexts.
      - competing_japanese:
          - データ は 売上 の 増加 を 示し て い ます。{しかし}、さらなる 分析 が 必要 です。
        english: The data shows an increase in sales. However, further analysis is required.
        hint: 「しかし」 introduces a stronger contrast and often signals a more critical or counter-argument.
          We're looking for a neutral connector that links a finding to a subsequent necessary action.
    scene: A researcher is presenting findings at an academic conference.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: This sentence uses formal and objective language ("データは...示しています," "分析が必要です"), appropriate
      for an academic or professional presentation. 「が」 connects the observed fact (data showing increase)
      with the logical next step or necessary action (further analysis), serving as a neutral connective
      that introduces additional information without strong opposition or emotional tone, typical for
      factual reporting.

        english: It's raining outside, but it's not cold at all.
        hint: 「だけど」 is a more casual alternative. While similar in meaning, 「が」 offers a slightly more
          standard and neutral tone.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 外 は 雨 {で}、全然 寒く ない です。
        english: It's raining outside and it's not cold at all.
        hint: Using the て-form 「で」 simply lists characteristics of the weather, whereas 「が」 specifically
          highlights the contrast between the rain and the temperature.
    scene: Two friends are looking out the window, observing the weather.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: This is a simple, direct observation in a casual setting. 「外は雨です」 (it's raining outside) and
      「寒くないです」 (it's not cold) are linked by 「が」 to present a mild contrast – rain often implies cold,
      but here it doesn't. The use of 「全然」 (not at all) emphasizes the lack of coldness. The overall tone
      is conversational and explanatory.

          contexts. We're looking for a more casual connection.

          fact.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新しい パソコン は 高い {けれど も}、性能 が いい です。

    scene: A man explaining his recent tech purchase to a friend.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker uses 「けど」 to soften the negative aspect (expensive) before highlighting the positive
      (good performance), which is common in conversational evaluations. The use of 「です」 and 「ね」 adds
      a semi-formal yet engaging tone.

        english: Even though this movie is interesting, it takes a long time to finish.
        hint: This phrasing implies a stronger sense of dissatisfaction or complaint about the movie's
          length, despite its interesting nature. We're looking for a more neutral contrasting opinion.

        english: This movie is interesting, but it takes a long time to finish.

        english: This movie is interesting. However, it takes a long time to finish.
        hint: 「ところが」 emphasizes a significant and often surprising contrast or unexpected development.
          We're looking for a milder, more direct way to express an opinion about a movie's length.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 映画 は 面白い。{だ が}、終わる まで 時間 が かかる。
        english: This movie is interesting. But, it takes a long time to finish.
        hint: 「だが」 provides a stronger, more definite contrast and is more formal. We're looking for a
          softer, more conversational way to state a contrasting opinion.
    scene: A man giving a frank review of a long movie to a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker is expressing an opinion about the movie using 「けど」 to introduce a contrasting
      point, specifically the length. This direct yet softened critical feedback, common among male speakers,
      reflects a casual and straightforward conversational style.
  - english: Excuse me, I have a question.
    japanese:
      - すみ ませ ん {けど}、質問 が ある の です が。

          - すみ ませ ん、質問 が あり ます。
        english: Excuse me, I have a question.
        hint: This is a direct statement and lacks the softening effect of けど. We're looking for a softer,
          more preliminary approach.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 質問 が あり ます。
        english: I have a question.
        hint: This is too abrupt and direct for approaching someone respectfully. We're looking for a
          polite, introductory phrase.
    scene: A student approaching their teacher after class.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: interrogative
    nuance: The use of 「けど」 here softens the directness of the question or request, making it more polite
      and less abrupt. It creates a pause for the listener to prepare for the upcoming statement, which
      is common in polite Japanese communication, especially when initiating interaction or making a request.

          - 彼女 は とても 正直 {けれど も}、時々 言い 過ぎる こと が ある。
        english: She is very honest, but sometimes she says too much.
        hint: 「けれども」 is a more formal alternative. We're focusing on the casual, conversational usage
          of けど to soften the critique.
    scene: Two friends discussing a mutual acquaintance.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The female speaker uses 「正直だけど」 to introduce a positive trait (honesty) before a gentle critique
      (says too much). This indirect approach to criticism, where a positive is stated first, is common
      in Japanese conversation, particularly among female speakers, to maintain harmony and politeness
      while still conveying an observation.

        english: The food at this restaurant is delicious, but the prices are a bit high.
        hint: The speaker is giving a balanced review, suggesting a more formal and objective tone. 「だ
          けれども」 is preferred over the more casual 「だけど」 to maintain this formality when evaluating a business.
          We're looking for a formal conjunction.

        english: The food at this restaurant is delicious, but the prices are a bit high.
        hint: 「ですが」 connects phrases with a direct 'but' and is polite, but 「けれども」 is used directly after
          the plain form of the adjective, offering a slightly more nuanced or literary feel to the contrast.
          We're looking for a more formal and nuanced connection.

        english: Although the food at this restaurant is delicious, the prices are a bit high.
        hint: 「ものの」 implies a stronger sense of contrast or unexpectedness, often emphasizing a surprising
          nature of the second clause. 「けれども」 is a more general 'but' or 'although' without that strong
          emphasis. We're looking for a less dramatic 'although'.

        hint: In an academic and professional discussion, the use of 「だ けれども」 emphasizes the contrast

          for a formal conjunction.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: He is a student, but already running a company.
        hint: 「が」 is formal but often simply links clauses or introduces additional information. 「けれども」
          implies a stronger 'although' or 'despite the fact' feeling, emphasizing the unexpectedness
          more. We're looking for a more emphatic 'although'.

          While grammatically correct, it's too emphatic and formal for a motivating conversation in a
          semi-formal workplace. We're looking for a more general formal conjunction.

      - competing_japanese:
          - この 仕事 は 難しい {が}、やりがい が あり ます。
        english: This job is difficult, but it's rewarding.
        hint: 「が」 is formal, but 「けれども」 can imply a deeper consideration or an emphasis on the 'despite'

          subtly conveys a sense of unfortunate contrast.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: How is your father's health, but please don't overexert yourself.
        hint: While 「ですが」 is polite, 「いかが で けれども」 allows for a smoother, more empathetic transition from

          smooth and considerate connection.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: He always practices diligently, but the results aren't easily coming.

          more objective and formal tone when discussing a player's performance, indicating a thoughtful
          assessment rather than a casual observation. We're looking for a formal tone.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: He always practices diligently, but the results aren't easily coming.
        hint: 「が」 is formal, but 「けれども」 can convey a slightly stronger sense of 'despite' or 'even though',

      despite a lack of immediate success.
    register: formal
    setting: serious

      expression that acknowledges both the positive (effort) and the negative (lack of results) aspects,
      characteristic of professional male discourse.

        hint: 「ものの」 is very formal and often emphasizes a strong, sometimes surprising, contrast, or a

          direct and common way to express a polite refusal. We're looking for a more common formal conjunction.

        english: I know a lot about that matter. However, I cannot discuss it now.
        hint: 「しかし」 is a sentence-initial conjunction, often introducing a strong contrast or shift in
          topic, making the connection between clauses more abrupt. 「けれども」 connects the clauses more smoothly,
          implying a direct continuation with a contrasting element. We're looking for a smoother connective.

    nuance: The female lawyer uses 「けれども」 to politely state a known fact (her knowledge) before firmly
      indicating a restriction (inability to speak). This specific use of 「けれども」 allows for a professional
      yet softer refusal compared to a more direct 「しかし」 or 「が」, maintaining a degree of politeness even
      when declining. It implies a 'regrettable' inability to comply.

          a conjunction that slightly elevates the narrative tone.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 来る と 約束 し た {が}、結局 現れ ませ ん でし た。
        english: He promised to come, but he didn't show up in the end.
        hint: 「が」 is generally more formal and less common in spoken storytelling for this kind of personal
          narrative. 「けれども」 maintains a conversational flow while still conveying the contrast effectively.
          We're looking for a more natural-sounding narrative connector.
    scene: A friend is recounting a story about someone who broke a promise.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
  - english: It's spring, but it's still cold, isn't it?
    japanese:
      - 春 {だ けれど も}、まだ 寒い です ね。
      - 春 {だ けれど}、まだ 寒い です ね。
      - 春 {です けれど も}、まだ 寒い です ね。
      - 春 {です けれど}、まだ 寒い です ね。
    english_literally: Spring it is, but still cold, isn't it?

      - competing_japanese:
          - 春 だ {けど}、まだ 寒い です ね。
        english: It's spring, but it's still cold, isn't it?
        hint: While 「だ けど」 is perfectly fine for casual remarks, 「だ けれども」 can add a slightly more thoughtful
          or expressive tone to the observation, emphasizing the unexpectedness of the cold. We're looking
          for a conjunction that adds a nuance of mild surprise or consideration.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 春 {です が}、まだ 寒い です ね。
        english: It's spring, but it's still cold, isn't it?
        hint: 「です が」 is polite, but 「だ けれども」 maintains a slightly more personal or empathetic tone in
          this kind of shared observation about the weather. We're looking for a connection that fosters
          shared feeling.
    scene: Two neighbors are chatting on the street, commenting on the unexpectedly chilly weather for
      the season.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The female speaker uses 「だ けれども」 to express a slight sense of mild surprise or disappointment
      about the persistent cold despite it being spring. This informal yet polite phrasing is common in
      casual social exchanges among women, highlighting a shared observation with a subtle emotional component.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, 「が」, 「けど」, and 「けれども」 are highly versatile particles
  that can be used across various registers and situations. Whether introducing a gentle contrast, softening
  a request, or signaling an implied continuation, they allow for nuanced communication without the strong
  oppositional force often associated with 'but' in English. Pay attention to the context to fully grasp
  its precise function in any given sentence. The choice between plain form + けど and polite form + けれども
  (or ですけど / だけど) depends entirely on the desired level of formality and the relationship with your interlocutor.
  Mastering this balance is key to sounding natural.
