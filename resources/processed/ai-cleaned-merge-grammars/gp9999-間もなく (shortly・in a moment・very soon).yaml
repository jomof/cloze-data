jlpt: N3
etymology: The term 「間もなく」 is a combination of 「間 (ma)」, meaning 'interval' or 'space between', and the
  adverbial form of the negative adjective 「無い (nai)」, which is 「無く (naku)」, meaning 'without'. Thus,
  the literal meaning is 'without interval' or 'with no time between'. This perfectly conveys the sense
  of immediacy and the impending nature of the event, as there is 'no time' left before it happens.
writeup: |-
  「間もなく」 is an adverb used to indicate that something will happen very soon or in a short while. It conveys a sense of immediacy and often implies that the event is definite or scheduled. While it can translate to 'soon' or 'shortly' in English, it generally carries a more formal or neutral tone compared to other expressions of immediacy.

  It is frequently used in announcements (e.g., at train stations, airports, or public events) or in written contexts where precision and a slightly elevated tone are desired. It can also describe personal events that are certain to occur in the near future, such as a birth or a major life change.

  One key characteristic of 「間もなく」 is its implication of a *lack of delay*. The event is not just 'soon', but rather 'without delay' from the current moment. This makes it suitable for conveying certainty about an approaching circumstance or action. Although often used in formal settings, it can appear in less formal sentences when the speaker wishes to emphasize the certainty or definiteness of a coming event.

  - term: すぐ (sugu)
    meaning: immediately, right away
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「すぐ」 is more immediate than 「間もなく」, often implying 'in the next second' or 'without any perceptible
      delay'. It is also much more common in casual conversation and can refer to actions happening *right
      now*. In contrast, 「間もなく」 often implies a brief, yet distinct, interval before the event, and is
      more formal.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:すぐ (immediately)
  - term: もうすぐ (mou sugu)
    meaning: soon, in a moment
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「もうすぐ」 is a very common, slightly more casual, and often softer way to say 'soon'. It carries
      a sense of anticipation but doesn't necessarily imply the same level of formality or scheduled certainty
      as 「間もなく」. It is broadly applicable to both planned and unplanned imminent events.
    grammar_point: もう (already・anymore)
  - term: そのうち (sono uchi)
    meaning: eventually, before long
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そのうち」 suggests something will happen in the near future, but it is less immediate and less
      definite than 「間もなく」. It implies a vaguer, possibly longer timeframe, and is more about a natural
      progression rather than a scheduled or highly certain event.
    grammar_point: そのうち (eventually・before long)
post_false_friends_writeup: While all these adverbs relate to future time, their nuances differ significantly.
  「すぐ」 emphasizes extreme immediacy, like 'right now' or 'in the blink of an eye'. 「もうすぐ」 is a more general
  and softer 'soon', common in everyday speech. 「間もなく」, however, conveys a sense of an imminent, often
  scheduled or certain, event with a slightly more formal tone, implying 'without further delay'. Lastly,
  「そのうち」 is the least immediate, suggesting 'eventually' or 'at some point in the near future' without
  specific certainty.

post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 「間もなく」 is versatile and can be used in various contexts,
  from public announcements to personal situations. Its strength lies in conveying a sense of definite,
  near-future occurrence without the extreme immediacy of 「すぐ」 or the casualness of 「もうすぐ」. It's particularly
  effective when describing scheduled events or significant, certain changes that are just around the
  corner.
