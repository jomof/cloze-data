    "etymology": "The phrase 「だけのことはある」 is composed of 「だけ」 (dake, only), 「の」 (no, possessive particle), 「こと」 (koto, thing/matter), 「は」 (wa, topic marker), and 「ある」 (aru, to exist). The literal sense is that something 'has the quality' that you would expect, given the initial condition. It implies a sense of validation or confirmation of an expectation.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「だけのことはある」 is used to express that something is \"as expected\" or \"not surprising\". It's often used with words like 「さすが」 (sasuga, as expected) or 「やはり/やっぱり」 (yahari/yappari, as I thought) to emphasize the expectation. It indicates that there's a valid reason for a particular outcome or quality, and it's not just a coincidence. The structure can follow verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns. When used with nouns and な-adjectives, 「な」 is necessary. In certain contexts, 「だっただけのことはある」 (datta dake no koto wa aru) can be used to emphasize a past result. **Important Consideration:** This expression is used only for positive evaluations. Avoid using it for negative outcomes or unexpected bad results.",
