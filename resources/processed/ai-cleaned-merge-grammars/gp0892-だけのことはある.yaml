    "etymology": "The grammar point 「だけのことはある」 is composed of 「だけ」 (dake, only, just), 「の」 (no, possessive particle), 「こと」 (koto, thing, matter), 「は」 (wa, topic marker), and 「ある」 (aru, to exist, to be). Literally, it implies that something has a certain 'value' or 'reason' (こと) because of a preceding fact or condition (だけ). The 「は」 emphasizes that this 'value' is worth noting or is as expected.",
    "writeup": "The grammar structure 「だけのことはある」 consists of the particle 「だけ」, 「の」, 「こと」, 「は」, and the verb 「ある」. It's used to indicate that something about (A) is 'as expected' or 'not surprising'. A literal translation suggests that the meaning is close to 'just in that it is (A), (B),' expressing that simply because (A) is (A), (B) is to be expected. 「だけのことはある」 often appears with words that emphasize the expectation of (A), such as 「さすが」, 「やはり」, or 「やっぱり」.\n\nThis pattern can follow verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns. な is required after な-adjectives. In the case of nouns and な-adjectives, 「だっただけのことはある」 may be used to highlight that a particular result is not surprising.\n\n**Important Caution:** 「だけのことはある」 is not used to indicate negative expectations; it only appears when the overall sentence is a positive evaluation of what was expected of (A).",
