    "etymology": "The phrase 「だけのことはある」 is composed of 「だけ」 (dake, only/just), the possessive particle 「の」 (no), 「こと」 (koto, matter/thing), the topic marker 「は」 (wa), and the verb 「ある」 (aru, to exist). Literally, it conveys the idea that 'there is only the matter of (something)', implying that the observed outcome is simply what one would expect given the preceding condition. It signifies that the situation 'has the worth' or 'has the reason' that justifies the outcome, thereby confirming an expectation or validation.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「だけのことはある」 is a versatile expression used to convey that a certain outcome or state is \"as expected\" or \"not surprising,\" given a particular preceding condition. It is typically employed when the outcome is positive or desirable, signifying that the effort, quality, or circumstances leading to it were worthwhile and naturally led to the observed result. This pattern frequently appears with adverbs such as 「さすが」 (sasuga, as expected) or 「やはり/やっぱり」 (yahari/yappari, as I thought), which further emphasize the sense of a confirmed expectation.\n\nThis structure can attach to various parts of speech:\n\n*   **Verbs**: Connects to the plain form (dictionary or past) of verbs to show that the action or state described by the verb directly explains the subsequent positive outcome.\n*   **い-adjectives**: Connects to the plain form (present or past) of い-adjectives to indicate that the quality described by the adjective justifies the result.\n*   **な-adjectives**: Requires 「な」 before 「だけのことはある」 when used in the present plain form (e.g., きれい**な**だけのことはある). If referring to a past state, 「だった」 is used (e.g., きれい**だった**だけのことはある).\n*   **Nouns**: Connects directly to nouns (e.g., 医者だけのことはある) or with 「だった」 for a past state (e.g., 医者だっただけのことはある).\n\n**Important Consideration:** 「だけのことはある」 is strictly used for positive evaluations. It is crucial to remember that this expression cannot be used to describe negative outcomes or unexpected bad results. For example, one cannot say 「馬鹿なだけのことはある」 (bakana dake no koto wa aru) to mean \"As expected, he's an idiot\" to explain a negative outcome. The expression implies a deserved, positive consequence.",
