    "writeup": "「やはり」 is an adverb used to express that something is as expected, after all, or still the case. It reflects the speaker's subjective assessment based on past experience or common sense. While it can be used in both formal and casual contexts, overuse may make your speech sound overly subjective. Understanding the nuances of 「やはり」 can add depth to your Japanese conversations and make them sound more natural. It's often used to express a sense of confirmation or agreement with a prior expectation. For example, 「やはりそうだ」 means \"I knew it!\" or \"That's what I thought!\".",
