    "etymology": "The term 「やはり」 is derived from 「は(者)」, referring to a person or thing, combined with 「あり」, meaning 'to be'. Over time, it evolved to mean 'as it should be' or 'as expected'. This etymology highlights its fundamental meaning of confirming a state or expectation, reflecting a sense of 'being as it ought to be'.",
    "writeup": "「やはり」 is an adverb used to express that something is as expected, after all, or still the case. It reflects the speaker's subjective assessment based on past experience or common sense. While it can be used in both formal and casual contexts, overuse may make your speech sound overly subjective. Understanding the nuances of 「やはり」 can add depth to your Japanese conversations and make them sound more natural. It's often used to express a sense of confirmation or agreement with a prior expectation. The term can imply a sense of validation for one's initial thoughts or predictions, or simply indicate that a situation continues unchanged.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「さすが(に)」 conveys admiration or recognition of someone's ability or quality, often with a sense of 'even I have to admit' or 'as expected from someone of your caliber'.

            "term": "まさか",
            "meaning": "No way; impossible; by no means",
            "kind": "antonym",
            "nuance": "While 「やはり」 confirms expectations, often with a sense of 'that's just how it is', 「まさか」 expresses disbelief or denial of something happening, conveying a strong sense of 'I never would have thought' or 'it couldn't possibly be'."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "「やはり」, 「結局」, 「さすが(に)」, and 「まさか」 all add nuance to your Japanese. 「やはり」 is for expressing that things are as expected, or that a situation persists. 「結局」 focuses on the final result after a process, often implying a conclusion. 「さすが(に)」 is used to admire or acknowledge someone's abilities or qualities, often with a sense of inevitability. And 「まさか」 is used when something is unbelievable or unexpected, serving as a direct contrast to 「やはり」.",

            "etymology": "The phrase 「見ていた通り」 (mite ita toori) means 'just as I was seeing' or 'just as I saw', emphasizing adherence to a previous observation. 「通り」 (toori) means 'street' but also 'as, in accordance with' from its original sense of 'passing through' or 'following a path'."

The 「なあ」 ending adds a touch of casual reflection or admiration, commonly used by older male speakers.

            "etymology": "「遅れる」 (okureru) means 'to be late' or 'to delay'. Its root can be traced to being 'behind' or 'slow'. The use of 「電車が」 (densha ga) highlights the train as the subject that is late."

            "etymology": "「日本酒」 (nihonshu) specifically refers to Japanese sake, literally 'Japanese alcohol'. 「好き」 (suki) meaning 'liking' or 'favorite', comes from a classical Japanese verb meaning 'to be charming' or 'to be attractive', which evolved to express affection."
