    "writeup": "「やはり」 is an adverb used to express that something is as expected, after all, or still the case. It's often used when a situation confirms a prior expectation, realization, or agreement. It indicates the speaker's subjective feeling that events have unfolded as anticipated, based on past experience or common sense. While it can be overused, using it properly in conversation adds a natural, Japanese-like quality to the discourse. It's versatile and can be used in both formal and casual settings. It can also convey a sense of \"also,\" similar to 「も」, but with an added nuance of expectation or confirmation.",
