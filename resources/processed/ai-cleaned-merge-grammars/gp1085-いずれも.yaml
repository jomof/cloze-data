        "part-of-speech": "adverb",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Often used in polite language and formal speech, it indicates inclusiveness or universality.",
        "function": "To indicate that something applies to all items/people in a given set, or neither/none when used with a negative predicate. It generalizes a statement across multiple options or members of a group."
    },
    "etymology": "The term いずれ (izure) derives from a formal adverb similar in meaning to 何 (nani - what), どう (dō - how), and どちら (dochira - which/where). The addition of the particle も (mo) expands its scope to signify 'any' or 'all of'. Historically, いずれ has been written with kanji such as 何れ or 孰れ, with 何れ being more common in modern usage.",
    "writeup": "いずれも (izuremo) is a formal adverb used to indicate that a statement applies to **all** items, individuals, or options within a specified set. In positive contexts, it translates to \"all\" or \"both.\" When used with a negative predicate, it signifies \"none\" or \"neither.\" For instance, if referring to two options, it means \"both,\" but if referring to multiple options, it means \"all.\"\n\nThis grammar point is often encountered in formal settings, academic papers, and business communications due to its polite and precise nature. It functions by comprehensively applying a characteristic or action to every member of a group or every option presented.\n\nWhile often written in hiragana, いずれ can also be found in kanji as 何れ or, less commonly, 孰れ. The latter kanji form is typically found in older literature.\n\nIt is important to distinguish いずれも from other fixed phrases that also use いずれ, such as いずれにしても, いずれにせよ, and いずれにしろ. These related expressions, while stemming from the same root, carry distinct meanings related to inevitability or certainty (e.g., \"in any case,\" \"at any rate\") and are typically considered separate grammatical constructs.",

            "meaning": "In any case; anyway; at any rate",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While いずれも focuses on 'all' or 'both' (inclusiveness), いずれにしても expresses that a certain outcome or fact is true regardless of other factors or circumstances. It implies a conclusion or inevitability, focusing on the certainty of a situation rather than the scope of application."

            "nuance": "Similar to いずれにしても, いずれにせよ also conveys a sense of 'at any rate' or 'anyway', indicating that a certain result will occur or a statement holds true regardless of other conditions. It is slightly more formal than いずれにしても and is often used in writing or more formal speech."

            "nuance": "This phrase is also similar to いずれにしても and いずれにせよ, carrying the meaning of 'in any case' or 'either way.' It is generally considered less formal than いずれにせよ and can often be used interchangeably with いずれにしても in casual contexts. Its nuance focuses on the certainty of a situation or outcome."

The key distinction lies in their function: いずれも describes the scope of application within a group, whereas the other phrases describe the certainty of a situation or outcome.",
