    "etymology": "いずれ (izure) originates from a formal adverb that shares a meaning with words such as 何 (nani - what), どう (dou - how), どちら (dochira - where), etc. Adding も (mo) to いずれ creates a broader sense of 'any' or 'all of'.",
    "writeup": "**いずれも (izuremo)** is a formal adverb that translates to \"all,\" \"none,\" or \"both,\" depending on the context. It is often used in polite language and formal speech. The literal translation can be understood as \"how even (A),\" \"where even (A),\" or \"what even (A).\" いずれ can also be written as 何れ or 孰れ, though the latter is less common. Some common set-phrases include いずれにしても, いずれにせよ, and いずれにしろ, all meaning \"in the end\" or \"at any rate.\" These phrases express that a particular result cannot be avoided.",
