    "etymology": "This construction combines the explanatory 「のだ」 (which emphasizes the reason or explanation for something) with 「ことだ」 (it is that...). Together, they pinpoint and emphasize a specific detail, often a time or event. The particle の (no) functions as a nominalizer, turning the preceding clause into a noun phrase, while は (wa) marks this nominalized phrase as the topic. こと (koto) refers to an abstract concept or matter, and だ (da) is the copula, completing the statement. This combination strongly highlights the timing or circumstance as the essence of the statement.",
    "writeup": "「のは〜のことだ」 is used to emphasize a particular detail, such as the time or place when something happened. Think of it as highlighting the 'when' or 'where' of a situation. It's similar to saying \"It was then that...\" or \"It is because of this that...\" in English. The clause before 「のは」 describes the event, and the noun following describes the specific detail you want to emphasize. This structure is often used to provide a clear, definitive statement about the timing or circumstances of an event, giving it a somewhat declarative or explanatory tone.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When choosing between 「のは〜のことだ」, 「〜ということだ」, and 「〜わけだ」, consider the context and your intention. Use 「のは〜のことだ」 when you want to emphasize a particular detail, especially a time or specific circumstance. Use 「〜ということだ」 when you are reporting something you heard or explaining the meaning of something. Use 「〜わけだ」 when you are explaining a reason or a logical conclusion based on observed facts.
