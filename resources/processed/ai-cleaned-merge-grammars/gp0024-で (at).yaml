    "etymology": "The particle で historically developed from the Old Japanese particle 「にて」 or 「にもて」, meaning \"by means of\" or \"at.\" This origin explains its broad function in marking the instrument or means by which an action is performed, which then extended to specifying the location where an action takes place. It shares its phonetic form with the te-form of certain verbs and adjectives, but its grammatical function as a particle is distinct.",
    "writeup": "**で** is a particle with several uses in Japanese. Fundamentally, it highlights the location where an action takes place or where a certain state exists. When indicating location, it translates to \"at\" or \"in\" in English. In this usage, the location is essential for the action to occur or the result to be achieved.",
