    Verb (past form) + 際に: Similar to the dictionary form, but emphasizes the action or event having already
      occurred.
    Noun + の + 際に: Indicates 'when' or 'at the time of' a particular event or situation related to the noun.

  details:
    part-of-speech: phrase
    register: formal
    usage-context: primarily used in formal or official contexts, often in written language or public announcements.
  etymology: The word 「際 (さい)」 itself means "edge," "verge," or "occasion." The addition of 「に」 creates
    an adverbial phrase that indicates a specific point in time or a particular situation. It suggests being
    on the "verge" of something happening or during a significant event.
  writeup: 「際に」 is used to indicate "when," "at the time of," "in case of," or "on the occasion of." It
    is more formal than 「時 (とき)」 and implies a somewhat important or significant event. 「際に」 appears after
    verbs in the dictionary or past tense forms, and after nouns with the particle 「の」. While the event
    is likely to be temporary or one-off, 「際に」 is not limited to one-off situations and can also appear
    with regularly occurring events. It's **important** to note that 「際に」 sounds unnatural when used with
    situations that typically do not change or always happen the same way. Use it when there's a sense of
    anticipation or a specific action being taken during an event.

    - term: にあたり・にあたって
      meaning: When, When doing something, On the occasion, At the time
      kind: synonym
      nuance: Unlike 「際に」, 「にあたり」 and 「にあたって」 are used to mark the beginning of something new or important.
        They highlight the significance of the occasion or action being taken.

    - term: に際して
      meaning: On the occasion of, At the time of
      kind: synonym
      nuance: 「に際して」 is very similar to 「際に」, but it often emphasizes preparations or arrangements being
        made *in anticipation* of the event.
      grammar_point: に際して (on the occasion of)
    - term: とき
      meaning: When, At the time of
      kind: synonym
      nuance: 「時」 is a more general term for "when" or "at the time of" and doesn't carry the same level
        of formality or significance as 「際に」.

    - term: ついでに
      meaning: While you are at it, On the occasion
      kind: often confused with
      nuance: 「ついでに」 means "while you're at it" or "incidentally," indicating that something is done as
        a byproduct or side effect of another action. 「際に」 is more focused on the specific timing of an
        event.
      grammar_point: ついでに (taking the opportunity)
    - term: 折には
      meaning: On the occasion of; When the opportunity arises; When
      kind: synonym
      nuance: 「折には」 is similar to 「時」 but implies a chance or opportunity. 「際に」 implies a specific event.
      grammar_point: 際に・折に・に当たって (on the occasion of・when)
  post_false_friends_writeup: While 「際に」 and other similar expressions can often be used interchangeably,
    it's important to consider the subtle nuances each one carries. 「際に」 emphasizes the specific timing
    of an event, while 「にあたり」 focuses on the beginning of something new, 「に際して」 highlights preparations,
    「時」 is a general term, 「ついでに」 indicates a side action, and 「折には」 suggests a chance occurrence. Choose
    the expression that best fits the intended meaning and context.

          hint: 「時」 is for general time references. 「際に」 is used for formal, specific actions that require

            act.
      scene: An election official giving instructions to voters.

        moment for learning. This formal phrasing is appropriate for a female professional sharing a significant
        career experience with a mentee.
  post_example_writeup: As demonstrated, 「際に」 is best reserved for moments of significance, formal procedures,

  details:
    part-of-speech: phrase
    register: formal
    usage-context: Used in formal situations, typically in writing or polite speech, to refer to a specific
      time or occasion that presents itself as an opportunity.
    function: Indicates a specific time or occasion as an opportunity or event.
    nuance: Carries a more formal and often anticipatory nuance than ときに, suggesting a welcomed or anticipated
      opportunity. Can imply a positive or beneficial event. The addition of は adds subtle emphasis.
    grammatical-role: adverbial phrase
    temporal-flow: Refers to a specific point or period in time, often an anticipated or opportune moment.
    spatial-flow: Not applicable; primarily temporal and situational
  etymology: 「折(おり)」, originally meaning "fold" or "pleat," is used here to denote a specific "occasion,"
    "time," or "opportunity." Its dual use for 'a turning point' or 'a bend in time' to refer to a specific
    opportune moment, when combined with the particle 「に」, functions adverbially, indicating the time *when*
    something occurs or an opportunity arises. The addition of 「は」, though often omitted, adds a subtle
    emphasis to that specific time or occasion.
  writeup: '「折には (ori ni wa)」 is a formal and somewhat stiff expression used to denote a specific **time
    or occasion** that presents itself as an opportunity. It is often translated as ''on the occasion of
    (A)'', ''when the chance of (A) comes up'', or simply ''when''. While grammatically similar to 「時に (toki
    ni)」, 「折には」 carries a more formal and often anticipatory nuance, suggesting a particular opportunity
    that is either welcomed or anticipated. It can imply a positive or beneficial event, though it is not
    exclusively limited to such situations. The usage is considered quite formal (硬い). This expression typically
    connects to nouns followed by 「の」 or verbs in their dictionary form. Although commonly seen as 「折には」,
    the particle 「は」 is frequently omitted, leaving 「折に」, which maintains the same meaning and formality.
    It is important to note that 「折には」 is often used for events or circumstances that recur or might arise
    repeatedly (e.g., ''when you come to Japan,'' which could happen multiple times), rather than strictly
    one-off, unique occurrences. However, it can also refer to a specific, unique past event that served
    as an important occasion.### Related ExpressionsJapanese features several fixed expressions using 「折」
    that convey slightly different nuances: *   **折に触れて (ori ni furete)**: ''Whenever the occasion arises,''
    ''from time to time,'' or ''always when prompted by the occasion.'' This implies a recurring action
    triggered by a particular circumstance. *   **折があれば (ori ga areba)**: ''If there is an opportunity/chance.''
    Expresses a conditional possibility. *   **折を見て (ori o mite)**: ''When the time is right,'' ''when conditions
    are favorable.'' Suggests waiting for an opportune moment. *   **折も折 (ori mo ori)**: ''At that very
    moment,'' ''at the critical juncture.'' Emphasizes the precise timing of an event, often implying coincidence
    or a turning point.'

        to the general and everyday 「とき」.
      grammar_point: とき (when)
  post_false_friends_writeup: While 「際に」 and 「とき」 can often be used similarly to 「折には」 in terms of conveying
    'when' or 'on the occasion of,' it is crucial to recognize the higher formality and specific nuance
    of 「折には」. Using 「折には」 in casual conversation or where a simpler expression suffices can sound overly
    stiff, unnatural, or even pretentious. 「折には」 adds a degree of politeness and anticipation that the other
    two expressions lack.

        shift in their feelings, making 「折には」 a fitting choice for its nuance of a special, impactful time.
  post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 「折には」 and its slightly less formal variant 「折に」 are particularly
    effective when referring to future anticipated events, expressing a sense of welcoming or looking forward
    to that specific occasion. This is why it often appears in formal invitations, offers of help, or when
    reminiscing about significant past events. The nuance of a specific, opportune moment sets it apart
    from more general temporal expressions.

        It marks the occasion as a memorable milestone, rather than just a general point in time, conveying
        a deeper emotional impact.
  post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, 「折(に)」 consistently denotes a particular, often
    significant or opportune, moment or circumstance. It adds a layer of formality and sometimes an implication
    of a 'chance' or 'opportunity' being taken advantage of, which differentiates it from more general temporal
    expressions.

  details:
    part-of-speech: phrase
    register: formal
    usage-context: Typically used in formal writing, official announcements, speeches, and ceremonial contexts.
    function: Marks a specific, often significant, occasion or turning point, indicating that an action
      or preparation is being undertaken in response to that occasion.
    nuance: Emphasizes a formal, ceremonial, or preparatory context for an action. It generally implies
      a positive or neutral situation and is not typically used for negative or unfortunate events.
    grammatical-role: connecting-phrase
  etymology: This grammar point is derived from the verb 「当たる (あたる)」, which means "to hit" or "to come into
    contact with." The 「に」 indicates the timing or occasion when something "hits" or occurs.
  writeup: '「にあたり」 or 「にあたって」 is a formal grammar pattern used to convey "at the time of (A)," "when doing
    (A)," or "on the occasion of (A)." Similar to 「に際して」 ("on the occasion of (A)"), it''s often used when
    preparing for future events. The structure combines 「に」 with the verb 「当たる」 (to hit, to come into contact)
    in either its formal-conjunctive form (にあたり) or te-form (にあたって). It''s commonly used in formal writing
    and speeches. There are two primary nuances: (A) is a special occasion or condition from which (B) arises.
    (A) is a goal or target and (B) is the means or measures taken in response. Important Considerations:
    Unlike 「に際して」, which can be used in both positive and negative situations, 「にあたり」 is primarily used
    for positive or neutral situations.'

      kind: similar expression
      nuance: Unlike 「にあたり」, which marks a significant occasion or preparation, 「につき」 indicates a reason,

    - term: に際して
      meaning: On the occasion of, At the time of
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While very similar in meaning and formality, 「に際して」 is more versatile and can be used in both

      grammar_point: に際して (on the occasion of)
    - term: 際に
      meaning: When, At the time of, In case of, On the occasion of
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「際に」 is a more general and less formal expression for 'when' or 'at the time of' compared
        to 「にあたり」. It can be used in a wider range of daily situations without the strong emphasis on a
        special occasion or preparation.

    - term: ついでに
      meaning: While you are at it, On the occasion

      nuance: 「ついでに」 implies doing something incidentally or conveniently while already performing another

        not an incidental one.
      grammar_point: ついでに (taking the opportunity)
    - term: てから
      meaning: After doing, Once... is done, Since
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「てから」 simply indicates a sequence of events or a starting point in time. It lacks the formal
        and 'occasion-marking' nuance of 「にあたり」, which is used for significant events or preparations.
      grammar_point: てから (after and since)
    - term: とき
      meaning: When, at the time of
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「とき」 is a very general term for 'when' or 'at the time'. Unlike 「にあたり」, it does not carry
        a formal tone or emphasize a special, often ceremonial, occasion for an action.
      grammar_point: とき (when)
  post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「にあたり」 is best used for formal announcements
    and preparations for events or goals, especially when those events are generally positive or neutral.
    It carries a more significant and preparatory nuance than the general temporal markers like 「時 (とき)」
    or 「てから」. While 「に際して」 offers broader applicability across positive, neutral, and negative situations,
    and 「際に」 is suitable for general, everyday 'when' contexts, 「につき」 explains reasons or rates. Lastly,
    「ついでに」 is used for opportunistic, secondary actions.
