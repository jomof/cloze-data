details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: These expressions are used to pinpoint a specific, often significant, moment or occasion
    when something occurs. They imply that the event or action is noteworthy or formal. 「際に」 is a general
    formal expression for 'when' or 'at the time of.' 「折に」 suggests an opportune or specific occasion,
    often with a slightly softer tone. 「に当たって」 is highly formal and implies facing an important, often
    one-time, event that requires preparation or a significant undertaking.
  function: To specify the timing of an event, emphasizing its significance or formality.
  nuance: 「際に」 is suitable for a wide range of formal situations. 「折に」 implies a suitable or specific
    opportunity. 「に当たって」 is reserved for momentous occasions, such as starting a new project, making a
    public announcement, or celebrating a milestone.
  grammatical-role: Temporal adverbial phrase.
etymology: 「際」 originally referred to an 'edge' or 'boundary,' evolving to mean a specific 'juncture'
  or 'occasion' in time. 「折」 refers to a 'turning point' or 'opportunity,' reflecting a specific moment.
  「に当たって」 comes from 「当たる」 (to hit, to face), indicating 'facing' or 'confronting' a particular event.
  These phrases combine to formally mark a specific time or event, adding a sense of importance and often
  preparation.
writeup: |-
  The phrases 「際に」, 「折に」, and 「に当たって」 all convey the meaning of 'when' or 'on the occasion of,' but they differ significantly in their formality and the specific nuances they carry. They are generally used in more formal contexts than the common 「とき」 or 「たら」.

  **際に** (際に) is the most versatile of the three for formal situations. It is used to indicate a specific point or period in time when something happens. It is frequently seen in written Japanese, official announcements, or formal speeches. It can often be translated as 'at the time of,' 'when,' or 'upon.'

  **折に** (折に) also means 'when' or 'on the occasion of,' but it often carries a nuance of an opportune or suitable time, or a specific, often recurring, occasion. It can feel slightly less stiff than 「際に」 and is often used when one hopes for or anticipates an opportunity. It is common to hear it in phrases like 「その折には」 (on that occasion) or 「折に触れて」 (whenever the opportunity arises).

  **に当たって** (に当たって) is the most formal and carries the strongest sense of a significant, often singular, event or turning point. It implies that the event requires preparation, careful consideration, or marks a new beginning. It is frequently used for ceremonies, grand openings, major announcements, or significant life events. For example, when giving a speech at a commencement ceremony or starting a new large-scale project, one might use 「に当たって」 to frame the action.
false_friends:
  - term: とき
    meaning: When, at the time
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とき」 is the most general and widely used word for 'when' or 'at the time.' It carries no specific
      nuance of formality or significance, unlike 際に, 折に, and に当たって, which often imply a more important
      or specific occasion. 「とき」 is appropriate for all registers and situations.
    grammar_point: とき (when)
  - term: うちに
    meaning: While; during; before (a change occurs)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「うちに」 emphasizes performing an action during a certain period or before a state changes. It
      highlights a continuous duration or a window of opportunity. 際に, 折に, and に当たって, conversely, refer
      to a specific point or phase rather than a continuous duration with an impending change.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary・い-Adj・な-Adj・Nounの]うちに (while a state continues)'
  - term: てから
    meaning: After doing; once...is done; since
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「てから」 strictly indicates a sequence of actions, meaning 'after X, then Y.' The phrases 際に,
      折に, and に当たって describe what happens *at* a particular occasion or turning point, which might involve
      a sequence but primarily mark the occasion itself rather than just the succession of events.
    grammar_point: てから (after and since)
  - term: たら
    meaning: If; when; after
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たら」 is a versatile conditional and temporal form, often used in casual conversation. It denotes
      a condition or sequence 'if/when X, then Y.' While similar to 際に in temporal use, たら lacks the formality
      and emphasis on a significant 'occasion' that 際に, 折に, and に当たって convey.
    grammar_point: たら (conditional, when・if A then B)
post_false_friends_writeup: While all these expressions relate to timing, remember that 際に, 折に, and に当たって
  add a layer of formality and often significance to the occasion. 「とき」 and 「たら」 are everyday terms, whereas
  「うちに」 focuses on action within a duration and 「てから」 on a strict sequence.

    setting: reflective
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)

    scene: A company or organization announcing its anniversary plans.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「に当たって」 (に当たって) with 「創立10周年を迎える」 (創立10周年を迎える - 'welcoming the 10th anniversary of establishment')
