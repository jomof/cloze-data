    "etymology": "The word 「ついで」 originally means \"opportunity\" or \"chance\". The particle 「に」 indicates purpose or direction. So, 「ついでに」 literally means \"using the opportunity\" or \"taking advantage of the chance.\"",
    "writeup": "「ついでに」 expresses the idea of doing something extra or secondary because the primary action presents a convenient opportunity. It conveys a nuance similar to \"while you're at it\" or \"on the occasion of.\" The root, 「ついで」, originally denotes \"opportunity\" or \"precedence,\" implying that the initial action or state serves as the natural impetus for the subsequent one. The second action is therefore a convenient byproduct, not necessarily the primary objective.\n\nIt is commonly used with verbs in plain forms (dictionary or past) and nouns, which are connected using the particle 「の」. However, as shown in the formation, more specialized uses exist with verb ます-stem and adjective stems, often in idiomatic expressions.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   While 「ついでに」 can sometimes describe regular occurrences, it is more frequently used for **one-off** or incidental actions, as opposed to habitually combined activities.\n*   It implies that the second action is less urgent or planned, benefiting from the convenience provided by the first.\n*   Its register is standard, but it can be used in more formal or polite contexts, sometimes even addressing a senpai, though less formal alternatives like 「ながら」 might be preferred for truly simultaneous or habitual actions.",
