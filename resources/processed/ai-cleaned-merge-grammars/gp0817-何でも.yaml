    "etymology": "Derived from the original meaning of 「何でも」 as 'anything' or 'whatever'. In this grammatical context, it implies that the information is not verified and could be 'anything' someone said, suggesting a degree of uncertainty about the source or veracity.",
    "writeup": "「何でも」 is used to convey information that the speaker has heard from someone else, but is not entirely certain about. It is similar to saying \"I heard that...\" or \"Apparently...\" in English. This usage indicates a level of uncertainty and that the information comes from an external source, thereby implying that the speaker is not fully responsible for the truthfulness of the information. It is most often used in casual conversation, providing a gentle way to introduce information without making a strong assertion. While it can appear in more formal contexts, it generally maintains this nuance of unconfirmed report.",
