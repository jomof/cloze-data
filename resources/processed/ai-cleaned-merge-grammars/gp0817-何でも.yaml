    },
    "etymology": "Derived from 「何でも」 meaning 'anything' or 'whatever'. In this grammatical context, it implies that the information is not verified and could be 'anything' someone said.",
    "writeup": "「何でも」 is used to convey information that the speaker has heard from someone else, but is not entirely certain about. It's similar to saying \"I heard that...\" or \"Apparently...\" in English. It indicates a level of uncertainty and that the information comes from an external source, and so the speaker is not responsible for the truthfulness of the information. It is most often used in casual speech.",
