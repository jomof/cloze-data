    "etymology": "This grammar point combines 「こと」 (koto), which nominalizes a verb or phrase, with 「にする」 (ni suru), meaning \"to decide\" or \"to make something so.\" So, literally, 「ことにする」 means \"to make it a thing\" or \"to make it a matter of course.\"",
    "writeup": "「ことにする」 (koto ni suru) expresses a decision to do something, or to make something a habit. It combines the nominalizer 「こと」 (koto) with 「にする」 (ni suru). Think of it as \"making something a thing\" that you do. This grammar point indicates a deliberate choice or resolution by the speaker.\n\n*   **Affirmative and Negative:** 「ことにする」 can be used with both affirmative (dictionary form) and negative (ない form) verb phrases. For example, 「毎日運動することにする」 (mainichi undō suru koto ni suru) means \"I've decided to exercise every day,\" while 「甘いものを食べないことにする」 (amai mono o tabenai koto ni suru) means \"I've decided not to eat sweets.\"\n\n*   **Polite Form:** The polite form 「ことにします」 (koto ni shimasu) is often used in formal settings or when speaking to superiors. For example, 「明日の会議は10時に始めることにします」 (ashita no kaigi wa jūji ni hajimeru koto ni shimasu) means \"I've decided that tomorrow's meeting will start at 10 o'clock.\"",
