        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "general",
        "function": "Expresses a decision or resolution made by the speaker regarding a situation or course of action.",
        "nuance": "Implies a strong, active, and often personal choice. The speaker is resolute in their decision.",
        "source": "Bunpro, Dictionary of Japanese Grammar (DOJG)"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことにする」 combines 「こと」 (koto), a nominalizer that transforms verbs or phrases into noun equivalents, with 「にする」 (ni suru), which means \"to decide\" or \"to make something so.\" Therefore, 「ことにする」 literally translates to \"to make it a matter\" or \"to make it a thing\" that one does. This construction highlights the speaker's conscious and deliberate act of making a decision.",
    "writeup": "「ことにする」 (koto ni suru) is used to express a personal decision or resolution to do (or not to do) something, or to establish a new habit. It signifies a choice actively made by the speaker.\n\nThis grammar point uses 「こと」 as a nominalizer, meaning the verb or verb phrase preceding it must be in its plain form (dictionary form for affirmative decisions, or the negative (ない) form for decisions not to do something). The 「にする」 portion then explicitly states that this nominalized action is the *thing* one decides upon.\n\nFor example:\n*   「毎日、運動することにする」 (mainichi undō suru koto ni suru) means \"I've decided to exercise every day.\"\n*   「甘いものを食べないことにする」 (amai mono o tabenai koto ni suru) means \"I've decided not to eat sweets.\"\n\nThe use of 「ことにする」 conveys a stronger sense of personal will and commitment compared to simply stating an intention. It implies a firm resolve. When used in its past tense, 「ことにした」, it indicates a decision that has already been made and is now a settled matter.\n\nWhile the basic form is 「ことにする」, it conjugates like a regular する verb, allowing for various tense and politeness levels, such as 「ことにします」 (polite non-past), 「ことにした」 (plain past), and 「ことにしませんでした」 (polite negative past). The volitional forms 「ことにしよう」 and 「ことにしましょう」 can be used to suggest making a decision, either to oneself or to others.",

            "meaning": "To decide on, to choose, to make something into",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While 「ことにする」 specifically implies a decision about an action or course of action, 「にする」 is broader and can be used for choosing objects or making general decisions. For example, 「コーヒーにする」 (kōhī ni suru) means \"I'll have coffee.\""
        },

            "term": "ようにする",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「ようにする」 implies an effort or attempt to do something regularly, suggesting an ongoing habit or goal. In contrast, 「ことにする」 is a firm, definite decision made at a specific point in time. For example, 「早く寝るようにする」 (hayaku neru yō ni suru) means \"I'll try to go to bed early,\" whereas 「早く寝ることにする」 (hayaku neru koto ni suru) is a firm decision to go to bed early."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「ことになる」 expresses a result or a decision made by someone else or by circumstances, not a personal decision like 「ことにする」. It conveys an outcome that is often beyond the speaker's direct control or simply a report of a factual outcome. For example, 「来月、転勤することになる」 (raigetsu, tenkin suru koto ni naru) means \"It has been decided that I will be transferred next month (by someone else or circumstances).\""
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key difference among these expressions lies in the degree of intent and control. 「ことにする」 reflects a personal resolution, an active choice made by the speaker. 「ようにする」 suggests an ongoing effort or attempt to establish a habit. Conversely, 「ことになる」 indicates an outcome or a decision made by external factors or by the general flow of events, not a personal, active choice by the speaker. Therefore, when choosing which expression to use, consider whether the speaker is actively making a decision, trying to maintain a habit, or simply reporting a result determined by outside forces.",
