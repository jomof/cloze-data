    "etymology": "「だが」 is a conjunction formed from 「だ」 (the plain form of 「です」, a copula indicating affirmation) and 「が」 (a conjunction indicating contrast). 「ですが」 is simply the polite form, using 「です」 instead of 「だ」.",
    "writeup": "「だが」 and 「ですが」 function as conjunctions to express contrast or contradiction, much like \"but\" or \"however\" in English. They convey a formal and direct opposition between two statements. Think of it as saying, \"That may be true, **but**...\" 「だが」 serves as the plain form, suitable for more formal or literary contexts, while 「ですが」 is its polite counterpart. When using 「ですが」, it is essential to maintain polite speech throughout the rest of the sentence, as it incorporates 「です」. In contemporary Japanese, the practice of adding 「ね」 after 「だが」 to soften its tone is not common and is more typical of older generations. For casual conversation, 「でも」 is generally preferred over 「だが」 due to the latter's somewhat stiff impression.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While 「が」 can connect clauses and imply contrast, it is less formal and direct than 「だが」 or 「ですが」. 「が」 often implies a softer contrast or additional information, whereas 「だが」/「ですが」 presents a clearer opposition."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「ところが」 often introduces an unexpected result or a situation that differs from what was expected. 「だが」 simply contrasts two statements."

            "nuance": "「けれども」 is a slightly more formal version of 「けど」. Like 「が」, it can introduce contrasting information, but it's less emphatic than 「だが」."

            "nuance": "「それでも」 implies that despite a previous statement or situation, something else is still true or will still happen. It adds a sense of persistence or resilience, which 「だが」 doesn't necessarily convey."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that 「だが」 and 「ですが」 are formal conjunctions best suited for writing or more serious conversations. For casual speech, prefer 「けど」 or 「でも」. When you want to emphasize an unexpected result, 「ところが」 might be a better fit. And if you need to convey persistence despite a previous fact, consider using 「それでも」.",
