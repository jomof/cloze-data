meaning: The base form of verbs used to connect to other verbs or auxiliaries, and to form the polite
  present tense.
pronunciation:
  katakana: マスけい
  romaji: masukei
formation:
  General Rule: The ます-stem is the base form of a verb to which various suffixes, auxiliary verbs, and
    other grammatical elements are attached. It is the part that precedes 「ます」 in the polite present tense.
  Group 1 Verbs (五段動詞): 'Change the final 「う」sound of the dictionary form to an 「い」sound. Example: 飲む
    (のむ) -> 飲みます (のみます), ます-stem is 飲み (のみ).'
  Group 2 Verbs (一段動詞): 'Remove the final 「る」 from the dictionary form. Example: 食べる (たべる) -> 食べます (たべます),
    ます-stem is 食べ (たべ).'
  Irregular Verbs (不規則動詞): する (to do) becomes し. くる (to come) becomes き.

details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used as the foundational stem for various conjugations and compound verbs across all
    registers.
  function: Connects verbs to other verbs or auxiliaries, forms polite present/negative, and indicates
    various grammatical functions.
  grammatical-role: Acts as the stem for diverse grammatical constructions.
etymology: The ます-stem (often referred to as 連用形 - ren'yōkei in a broader sense) is inherently linked
  to the polite ます form. Historically, the ます ending evolved from older honorific auxiliaries, signifying
  politeness. The 'stem' itself represents the fundamental, stable core of the verb, a base to which different
  grammatical particles and suffixes are attached, allowing for diverse meanings and grammatical functions
  to be built upon a single lexical root. Its role as a 'continuative form' highlights its ability to
  seamlessly link with other verbal elements.
writeup: |-
  The ます-stem (often referred to as the 'pre-masu form') is one of the most fundamental and versatile verb forms in Japanese. It is the base from which the polite present and negative forms (〜ます and 〜ません) are constructed, and it also serves as the connective form for a multitude of other grammatical structures and compound verbs.

  Understanding how to form the ます-stem is crucial for all Japanese learners. For **Group 1 verbs (五段動詞)**, which end in an 'u' sound in their dictionary form, you change that 'u' sound to an 'i' sound. For instance, 読む (yomu - to read) becomes 読み (yomi). For **Group 2 verbs (一段動詞)**, which typically end in 'eru' or 'iru' (and the 'ru' is dropped to form the stem), you simply remove the final 「る」. For example, 食べる (taberu - to eat) becomes 食べ (tabe). The irregular verbs する (suru - to do) and くる (kuru - to come) have unique ます-stems: し (shi) and き (ki), respectively.

  Beyond just forming the polite plain present tense, the ます-stem is indispensable for creating many essential expressions. It combines with auxiliary verbs to express desire (〜たい), purpose (〜に行く), the beginning of an action (〜始める), the completion of an action (〜終わる), and the ease or difficulty of an action (〜やすい / 〜にくい). It also forms compound nouns when combined with 方 (kata - way of doing). Mastery of the ます-stem is a cornerstone for progressing in Japanese grammar.

  - term: Verb[て] (and then)
    meaning: te-form (connective form)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While the て-form is often derived from the ます-stem, it functions specifically as a connective
      to link clauses, request actions, or indicate a sequence of events. The ます-stem is a broader base
      for various suffixes and compound words, not exclusively for sequential actions or requests.
    grammar_point: Verb[て] (and then)
  - term: Verb[ます] (polite present)
    meaning: polite present tense
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: The ます-stem is the *base* from which the polite present tense Verb[ます] is formed by adding
      「ます」. Verb[ます] is a complete conjugation indicating politeness and present/future tense, whereas
      the ます-stem is an incomplete form that requires a suffix to function grammatically as a standalone
      verb.
    grammar_point: Verb[ます] (polite present)
post_false_friends_writeup: It is common for learners to conflate the ます-stem with the complete polite
  form (〜ます) or the て-form. Remember that the ます-stem is the raw, unsuffixed base used *before* adding
  〜ます or other auxiliary verbs and suffixes. The 〜ます form is a fully conjugated polite verb, and the て-form,
  while often derived from the ます-stem, has distinct connective and functional roles such as linking actions
  or forming requests.

        hint: This uses the plain form of the verb. We're looking for the polite form, which uses the

    scene: A musician performing.
    register: teineigo (polite)

    english_literally: Come here!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ここ に 来 て ください。
        english: Please come here.
        hint: This is a polite request. We're looking for a more direct, yet still polite, command using
          the ます-stem.
    scene: A teacher calling a student.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: commanding
    nuance: The ます-stem 「来」 combines with 〜なさい to form a polite imperative. While polite, 「来なさい」 can sound
      somewhat direct or like an instruction, often used by parents to children or teachers to students.
      「来て」 also uses the ます-stem 「来」 and is a common, slightly more casual way to say 'Come here' using
      the te-form.
post_example_writeup: As demonstrated in these examples, the ます-stem is incredibly versatile. It is not
  a complete verb on its own but acts as a fundamental building block. Understanding how it attaches to
  various suffixes and auxiliary verbs is key to forming complex and nuanced Japanese sentences. Always
  remember to identify the verb group (Group 1, Group 2, or irregular) correctly to form the ます-stem accurately.
