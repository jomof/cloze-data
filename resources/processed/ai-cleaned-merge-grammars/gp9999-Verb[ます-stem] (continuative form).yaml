details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used in various constructions, including politeness, compound verbs, and nominalization.
  function: Connective, noun-forming, base for compound verbs and various suffixes.
  nuance: Implies an incomplete action, a conceptualized action, or acts as a base for further grammatical
    elements.
  grammatical-role: Forms compound verbs, links clauses, nominalizes verbs.
etymology: The ます-stem is historically derived from the 連用形 (ren'yōkei - continuative form) of verbs in
  classical Japanese. This form was traditionally used to connect clauses, form nouns, and combine with
  auxiliary verbs and suffixes. Its name, "連用形" (ren'yōkei), literally means "form used for connecting
  to verbs" or "form used for continuous action," highlighting its connective and continuative nature.
  With the development of the modern polite ます ending, this stem became strongly associated with it, hence
  its common modern name "ます-stem" (マス形 - masu-kei).
writeup: |-
  The ます-stem, also known as the continuative form (連用形 - ren'yōkei), is a fundamental verb form in Japanese that serves multiple crucial grammatical functions. It is typically the base form to which various suffixes, auxiliary verbs, and particles are attached to create more complex expressions.

  **Formation:**
  *   **Group 1 Verbs (Godan Dōshi):** For verbs ending in a う (u) sound, change the final syllable to its corresponding い (i) sound. For example, 読む (yomu - to read) becomes 読み (yomi), 行く (iku - to go) becomes 行き (iki).
  *   **Group 2 Verbs (Ichidan Dōshi):** For verbs ending in いる (iru) or える (eru), simply remove the final る (ru). For example, 食べる (taberu - to eat) becomes 食べ (tabe), 見る (miru - to see) becomes 見 (mi).
  *   **Irregular Verbs:** The irregular verbs する (suru - to do) and 来る (kuru - to come) have unique ます-stems: する becomes し (shi), and 来る becomes 来 (ki).

  **Key Uses:**

  1.  **Forming the Polite Present/Past Tense:** This is the most common use. By adding ます (masu) to the stem, you create the polite non-past form (e.g., 食べます, 読みます). Adding ました (mashita) forms the polite past tense.

  2.  **Connecting Verbs/Nominalization:** The ます-stem can directly connect two verbs, often implying a sequence of actions or a combined action (e.g., 読み書き - reading and writing). It can also function as a noun, representing the action itself or a place/time related to the action (e.g., 休み - a rest/holiday from 休む - to rest).

  3.  **Forming Compound Verbs:** Many compound verbs are formed by attaching another verb (often in its ます-stem or other forms) or an auxiliary verb to the ます-stem of the main verb. For instance, 始めます (hajimemasu - to begin) can combine with a ます-stem verb to indicate starting that action (e.g., 食べ始めます - to start eating).

  4.  **Combining with Various Suffixes and Auxiliary Verbs:** The ます-stem is the base for numerous grammatical patterns, such as:
      *   〜たい (tai - to want to do)
      *   〜なさい (nasai - polite imperative)
      *   〜やすい (yasui - easy to do)
      *   〜にくい (nikui - difficult to do)
      *   〜に行く (ni iku - to go for the purpose of doing)

  Understanding the ます-stem is crucial as it underpins a significant portion of Japanese verb conjugation and grammatical construction. It's not just a polite form, but a versatile stem that allows for rich and nuanced expression.

  - term: Verb[て] (and then)
    meaning: The te-form of a verb, used to connect verbs, describe a state, or form requests.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While the ます-stem can connect verbs, the te-form is more versatile for sequential actions,
      concurrent actions, or connecting clauses with various grammatical functions (e.g., requests, permissions,
      states). The ます-stem connecting verbs often implies a more tightly bound or habitual compound action,
      or forms a noun.
    grammar_point: Verb[て] (and then)
  - term: い-Adjective (connecting and adverbial form)
    meaning: The く-form of an い-adjective, used to connect adjectives or modify verbs.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to how the ます-stem connects verbs or functions nominally, the く-form of an い-adjective
      also serves a connective function, linking adjectives or acting adverbially. However, the ます-stem
      is for verbs, while the く-form is for い-adjectives.
    grammar_point: い-Adjective (connecting and adverbial form)
  - term: Noun + の (possession)
    meaning: The particle の used to show possession or modify a noun.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both the ます-stem (when nominalized) and の can make a word function like a noun or modify another
      noun. However, the ます-stem specifically nominalizes verbs, turning an action into a noun (e.g.,
      読み - reading as a noun), while の connects nouns (e.g., 私の本 - my book) or nominalizes clauses.
    grammar_point: の (possession)
  - term: Verb[ます] (polite present)
    meaning: The polite non-past form of a verb.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: The ます-stem is the *base* form to which ます is added. The ます-form (e.g., 食べます) is a complete,
      polite verb. The ます-stem (e.g., 食べ) itself is not a complete verb and cannot stand alone as a sentence
      in standard Japanese, though it can form nouns or act as a conjunctive element.
    grammar_point: Verb[ます] (polite present)
post_false_friends_writeup: The ます-stem is a foundational element in Japanese grammar, distinct from other
  connective forms or polite endings. While the te-form connects actions sequentially or concurrently,
  the ます-stem primarily serves as a base for politeness markers or to form compound verbs and nominalized
  actions. Similarly, while adjectives have their own connective forms, the ます-stem is specific to verbs.
  It's crucial to recognize the ます-stem as the versatile root for building more complex verbal expressions,
  rather than confusing it with the complete polite form or other particles that modify nouns.
examples:
  - english: My day off is tomorrow.
    japanese:
      - 私 の {休み} は 明日 です。
      - 私 の {休み} は 明日 だ。
      - '{休み} は 明日 です。'
      - 明日 は 私 の {休み} です。
    english_literally: My rest is tomorrow.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 休む が 明日 です。
        english: I will rest tomorrow (but sounds unnatural as a statement about a day off).
        hint: The grammar point is used to nominalize the verb, turning the action of 'resting' into the
          noun 'a day off'. We're looking for the nominalized form.

    nuance: The verb 「話す」 (hanasu - to talk) takes the ます-stem 「話し」 (hanashi) when combined with 「続ける」
      (tsuzukeru - to continue), forming the compound verb 「話し続ける」 (hanashitsuzukeru) meaning 'to continue
      talking'. This illustrates the ます-stem's role in forming compound verbs.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 早く 寝 て。

    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: imperative polite (～なさい)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The verb 「寝る」 (neru - to sleep) takes the ます-stem 「寝」 (ne) when combined with 「なさい」 (nasai),
      forming the polite imperative 「寝なさい」 (nenasai). This form, while polite, is often used by someone
      in a position of authority towards someone younger or of lower status, like a parent to a child.
      The use of 「早く」 (hayaku - quickly) adds to the instructional tone.

    nuance: The verb 「飲む」 (nomu - to drink) takes the ます-stem 「飲み」 (nomi) when combined with 「ません」 (masen),
      forming the polite negative 「飲みません」 (nomimasen). This is a standard polite way to state a negative
      habit or preference. The speaker being female and the listener being a 'group' (e.g., colleagues,
      clients) reinforces the use of polite language.

    scene: Discussing a singer's performance.
    register: casual
    setting: creative
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate the versatility of the ます-stem, showing its use in nominalization
  (休み), forming compound verbs (読み書き, 降り出す, 話し続ける, 作り始める), expressing desire (食べたい), purpose of movement
  (遊びに行く), polite commands (寝なさい), expressing ease or difficulty (読みやすい, 書きにくい), and forming polite negative
  verbs (飲みません). This core form is indispensable for building various grammatical structures in Japanese.
