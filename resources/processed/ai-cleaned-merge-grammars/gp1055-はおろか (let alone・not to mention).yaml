  usage-context: Often used when talking about something that is difficult or impossible, emphasizing
    that even a less challenging thing is not possible. Can also be used to highlight a surprisingly broad
    scope.
  function: To emphasize an extreme or unexpected outcome by presenting a less extreme case, or to indicate
    that something is definitely true (or not true) if an associated, less likely thing is already true
    (or not true). It highlights a degree of impossibility or certainty.
  nuance: It implies that the thing before はおろか is already difficult or impossible, and therefore the
    thing after it (which is even more so) is also difficult or impossible. It sets up a comparison where
    the item after はおろか is a step beyond the first item in terms of difficulty, expense, etc., and the
    shared predicate (often negative) applies to both.
  counterpoint: もちろん (not only... but also) can state 'not only X but also Y'. はおろか implies a stronger
    degree of 'let alone' often leading to a negative result for both X and Y.
  colocation: Often followed by も, さえ, まで. Used with nouns or plain forms of verbs and adjectives.
  grammatical-role: Connects two items (nouns, clauses) where the second item is presented as an even
    stronger case (either more impossible/difficult or more certain/easy).
etymology: 愚か (oroka) means 'foolish' or 'absurd'. When combined with the topic marker は, the phrase はおろか
  implies that it is 'absurd' or 'foolish' to even consider the first item, let alone the second. This
  origin highlights the strong emphasis on the certainty of the second item's state, given the first.
writeup: はおろか is a grammatical construction used to express a strong emphasis, often in situations where
  something is unexpectedly difficult, impossible, or, conversely, surprisingly easy. It literally means
  'foolish to consider' or 'absurd to mention,' deriving from the adjective 愚か (oroka). This underlying
  meaning gives the construction its power to set up a logical progression where if the first item (A)
  is true (or not true), then the second item (B), which is typically a more extreme or less expected
  case, is even more so. The common pattern is **[A] はおろか [B] も/さえ/まで [negative predicate]**. In this
  structure, A is something that would be considered relatively easy or common, while B is something more
  challenging, expensive, or rare. The negative predicate then applies to both A and B, emphasizing that
  if A is not possible, then B is certainly not. For instance, 「彼は簡単な計算はおろか、足し算もできない」(He can't even do
  simple addition, let alone complex calculations). Here, simple addition (簡単な計算) is less difficult than
  complex calculations (難しい計算), but if the easier one is impossible, the harder one is definitely impossible.
  Conversely, はおろか can also be used with a positive predicate, though less commonly. In such cases, it
  highlights that if something basic (A) is true, then something more significant (B) is also true. For
  example, 「彼女は日本語の単語はおろか、漢字まで完璧に覚えている」(She perfectly remembers not only Japanese vocabulary, but even
  kanji). This usage emphasizes the extent or thoroughness. It is crucial to understand that はおろか implies
  a scale or hierarchy. The item preceding はおろか (A) is usually presented as a starting point on this scale.
  The item following はおろか (B) is further along the scale, either in terms of difficulty, expense, quantity,
  or some other metric. The meaning then conveys that if A is already at a certain state (often negative),
  B is even more so.

  - term: はもちろん (not only... but also)
    meaning: As a matter of course
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: はもちろん means 'not only X, but naturally Y also,' implying Y is an obvious addition to X. はおろか
      has a stronger emphasis on X being difficult or impossible, and therefore Y (which is even more
      difficult) is also impossible, or if X is surprisingly easy, then Y is also easy. The emphasis with
      はおろか is often on the impossibility or extreme nature, usually with a negative outcome.
    grammar_point: はもちろん (not only... but also)
  - term: 〜ばかりでなく・〜だけでなく (not only... but also)
    meaning: Not only but also
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ばかりでなく simply means 'not only X but also Y,' listing two things without necessarily implying
      a scale of difficulty or a strong negative implication like はおろか. はおろか typically presents the first
      item as already challenging or out of reach, making the second item even more so.
    grammar_point: 〜ばかりでなく・〜だけでなく (not only... but also)
  - term: さえ (even・if only)
    meaning: Giving an extreme example
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: さえ emphasizes that 'even X' is true. While it can introduce an extreme example, はおろか explicitly
      sets up a comparison between two items, asserting that if the less extreme item (before はおろか) is
      impossible, then the more extreme item (after はおろか) is certainly impossible. さえ can be used more
      broadly without this explicit comparative structure.
    grammar_point: さえ (even・if only)
post_false_friends_writeup: The expressions はもちろん, 〜ばかりでなく・〜だけでなく, and さえ all share the commonality of
  adding information or emphasizing an item. However, はおろか stands out due to its inherent implication
  of scale and often, a sense of impossibility or extreme degree. While はもちろん and 〜ばかりでなく simply list
  additional items or facts, はおろか suggests that if something basic or expected (the first item) is beyond
  reach, then something more challenging or extreme (the second item) is certainly also out of reach.
  Similarly, さえ highlights an extreme example, but はおろか specifically builds a logical progression between
  two items. Always consider the nuance of impossibility or heightened degree when choosing はおろか.
examples:
  - english: Let alone vegetables, he won't even eat meat.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 野菜 {は おろか}、肉 さえ 食べ ない。
      - 彼 は 野菜 {は おろか}、肉 さえ 食べ ませ ん。
      - 彼 は 野菜 {は おろか}、肉 すら 食べ ない。
    english_literally: As for him, vegetables let alone, meat even won't eat.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 野菜 も 肉 も 食べ ない。
        english: He eats neither vegetables nor meat.
        hint: This simply states he doesn't eat both. We're looking for an expression that implies if
          he doesn't eat vegetables, he certainly won't eat meat.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 野菜 は もちろん、肉 も 食べ ない。
        english: He doesn't eat vegetables, and of course he doesn't eat meat either.
        hint: はもちろん suggests that eating vegetables is expected, and eating meat is also not done. We
          want to imply that eating vegetables is already difficult for him.
    scene: A picky eater at dinner.

  - english: Not to mention her beauty, her personality is also wonderful.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 美し さ {は おろか}、性格 まで 素晴らしい。
      - 彼女 は 美し さ {は おろか}、性格 まで 素晴らしい です。
    english_literally: As for her, beauty let alone, personality even wonderful.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 美しい し、性格 も 素晴らしい。
        english: She is beautiful, and her personality is also wonderful.
        hint: This simply lists two positive qualities. We're looking for an expression that emphasizes
          her personality as being an even greater quality than her beauty.
    scene: Two friends gossiping about a mutual acquaintance.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: This sentence shows that even the beauty (which might be the first thing one notices) is great,
      but her personality (something deeper) is also wonderful, implying an even higher level of admiration.
  - english: I don't have time to sleep, let alone study.
    japanese:
      - 勉強 する {は おろか}、寝る 時間 さえ ない。
      - 勉強 する {は おろか}、寝る 時間 さえ あり ませ ん。
      - 勉強 する {は おろか}、寝る 時間 すら あり ませ ん。
    english_literally: Study let alone, sleeping time even don't exist.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 勉強 も 寝る 時間 も ない。
        english: I don't have time to study or sleep.
        hint: This just states a lack of time for both. We want to convey that if there's no time for
          sleep, then studying is definitely out of the question.
    scene: A student overwhelmed with work during exam period.
    register: casual
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「寝る時間さえない」 highlights the extreme lack of time. If there's no time for something
      as basic as sleep, studying (勉強する) is certainly impossible. The 「さえ」 after the second item reinforces
      the 'even' nuance.
  - english: The company's sales plummeted, and let alone a bonus, employees' salaries couldn't even be
      paid.
    japanese:
      - 会社 の 売上 は 激減 し、ボーナス {は おろか}、社員 の 給料 さえ 払え なかっ た。
      - 会社 の 売上 は 激減 し、ボーナス {は おろか}、社員 の 給料 さえ 払え ませ ん でし た。
      - 会社 の 売上 は 激減 し、ボーナス {は おろか}、社員 の 給料 すら 払え ませ ん でし た。
    english_literally: Company's sales dramatically decreased, bonus let alone, employee's salary even
      couldn't pay.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会社 の 売上 は 激減 し、ボーナス だけ で なく、社員 の 給料 も 払え なかっ た。
        english: The company's sales plummeted, and not only bonuses, but also employees' salaries couldn't
          be paid.
        hint: 「だけでなく」 simply lists two things that couldn't be paid. We are looking for a phrase that
          implies the bonus was already a distant possibility, making salaries impossible.
    scene: A business report on a struggling company.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: This conveys the severity of the financial situation. Paying a bonus (ボーナス) is already difficult
      for a struggling company; the fact that they couldn't even pay salaries (社員の給料) emphasizes the dire
      straits.
  - english: The road was so rough that it wasn't easy to walk, let alone drive.
    japanese:
      - 道 は 運転 する {は おろか}、歩く の も 楽 じゃ なかっ た。
      - 道 は 運転 する {は おろか}、歩く の も 楽 で は あり ませ ん でし た。
    english_literally: Road as for, driving let alone, walking even not easy was.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 道 は 運転 も 歩く の も 大変 だっ た。
        english: The road was difficult for both driving and walking.
        hint: This simply states that both actions were difficult. We want to imply that walking was already
          hard, so driving was certainly impossible.
    scene: Describing a difficult path during a hike.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「歩くのも楽じゃなかった」 implies that even walking was hard. Therefore, driving (運転する) would have been
      impossible. The grammar point emphasizes the extreme difficulty.
  - english: Nowadays, let alone adults, even children use smartphones.
    japanese:
      - 最近 は 大人 {は おろか}、子供 まで スマート フォン を 使う。
      - 最近 は 大人 {は おろか}、子供 まで スマート フォン を 使い ます。
    english_literally: Recently as for, adults let alone, children even smartphone use.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 最近 は 大人 も 子供 も スマート フォン を 使う。
        english: Nowadays, both adults and children use smartphones.
        hint: This is a simple statement of fact. We want to emphasize the surprising extent of smartphone
          use, including children.
    scene: Discussing the widespread use of technology.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: This example demonstrates the widespread adoption of smartphones. While it's expected for
      adults (大人) to use them, the inclusion of children (子供まで) highlights the extent of this trend.
  - english: He can't even draw a straight line, let alone paint a picture.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 絵 を 描く {は おろか}、直線 すら 引け ない。
      - 彼 は 絵 を 描く {は おろか}、直線 すら 引け ませ ん。
    english_literally: He as for, picture draw let alone, straight line even can't draw.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 絵 を 描く こと も、直線 すら 引く こと も でき ない。
        english: He cannot paint a picture, nor can he even draw a straight line.
        hint: This sounds a bit clunky and merely lists the impossibilities. We are looking for an expression
          that suggests drawing a straight line is a fundamental, easier task than painting, and both
          are impossible.
    scene: An art teacher lamenting a student's lack of basic skills.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The usage of 「すら」 after 「直線」 emphasizes the extreme lack of fundamental drawing ability. If
      drawing a straight line is impossible, then painting a whole picture (絵を描く) is entirely out of the
      question.
  - english: I don't have time to eat breakfast, let alone prepare dinner.
    japanese:
      - 夕食 を 作る {は おろか}、朝ごはん を 食べる 時間 も ない。
      - 夕食 を 作る {は おろか}、朝ごはん を 食べる 時間 も あり ませ ん。
    english_literally: Dinner prepare let alone, breakfast eat time even don't have.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 夕食 を 作る の は 無理 で、朝ごはん を 食べる 時間 も ない。
        english: Preparing dinner is impossible, and I don't even have time to eat breakfast.
        hint: This uses two separate clauses. We want a more cohesive expression that links the two actions
          by a logical progression of difficulty.
    scene: A busy professional talking about their schedule.
    register: casual
    setting: professional
    nuance: This highlights how busy the speaker is. Preparing dinner (夕食を作る) is a bigger task than eating
      breakfast. The fact that they don't even have time for the smaller task (朝ごはんを食べる) implies they
      certainly don't have time for the larger one.
  - english: Let alone an ordinary person, even a professional couldn't solve this problem.
    japanese:
      - 一般 人 {は おろか}、プロ の 専門 家 で さえ この 問題 を 解決 でき なかっ た。
      - 一般 人 {は おろか}、プロ の 専門 家 で さえ この 問題 を 解決 でき ませ ん でし た。
      - 一般 人 {は おろか}、プロ の 専門 家 で すら この 問題 を 解決 でき ませ ん でし た。
    english_literally: Ordinary person let alone, professional expert even this problem could not solve.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 一般 人 は もちろん、プロ の 専門 家 で さえ この 問題 を 解決 でき なかっ た。
        english: Of course an ordinary person, but even a professional expert couldn't solve this problem.
        hint: 「もちろん」 implies that it's natural for an ordinary person not to solve it. はおろか gives a stronger
          sense of surprise that even a professional expert couldn't do it, therefore an ordinary person
          stands no chance.
    scene: Discussing a complex scientific puzzle.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: This emphasizes the extreme difficulty of the problem. If even a professional expert (プロの専門家でさえ)
      couldn't solve it, then it's certainly impossible for an ordinary person (一般人).
  - english: They were so tired that they couldn't even stand up, let alone walk.
    japanese:
      - 疲れ て、歩く {は おろか}、立つ こと さえ でき なかっ た。
      - 疲れ て、歩く {は おろか}、立つ こと さえ でき ませ ん でし た。
      - 疲れ て、歩く {は おろか}、立つ こと すら でき ませ ん でし た。
    english_literally: Tired, walk let alone, stand up thing even couldn't do.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 疲れ て、歩く こと も 立つ こと も でき なかっ た。
        english: Being tired, they couldn't walk or stand.
        hint: This simply lists the actions they couldn't perform. We want to express that standing up
          is a prerequisite for walking, and if even standing was impossible, walking was definitely impossible.
    scene: Describing exhausted marathon runners.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: The sentence emphasizes extreme fatigue. If standing up (立つこと) was impossible, walking (歩く)
      was certainly out of the question. The usage here underlines the severity of their physical state.
