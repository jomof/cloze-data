    },
    "etymology": "The verb 「する」 originally meant \"to do\" or \"to make.\" Over time, it evolved to also express the concept of something costing a certain amount, essentially \"making\" or \"equaling\" that value. This usage likely stemmed from the idea of a transaction, where something \"does\" or \"makes\" a particular price. Its usage for time might similarly derive from an action \"making\" a certain duration pass.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「する」 is highly versatile in Japanese, and one of its lesser-known usages is to express either the cost of something or the duration of a period. This is distinct from its more common meaning of \"to do.\"\n\n**1. Expressing Cost (費用)**\nWhen used to express cost, 「する」 follows the pattern: **[Object] + は/が + [Amount] + {する}**. This directly states the price of an item or service.\n\n*   Example: この カメラ は 五万円 {する}。(This camera costs 50,000 yen.)\n\nThis usage is common in various settings, from casual conversations to professional inquiries about pricing.\n\n**2. Expressing Time Duration (期間)**\nWhen 「する」 expresses time duration, it indicates that a certain period of time has passed or will pass. This usage is typically found in subordinate clauses, describing a period leading up to another event or condition.\n\n*   Example: 後 一年 {したら} 大学 を 出る。(After one more year, I will graduate from college.)\n\nIt is grammatically unusual for this sense of 「する」 to appear in the main clause independently; it usually modifies another action or state that occurs after the specified duration.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   The context will always clarify whether 「する」 refers to \"to do,\" \"to cost,\" or \"to take (time).\" For cost, look for monetary values. For time, look for time-related nouns.\n*   While 「する」 can be conjugated like a regular verb in this sense (e.g., します, した, しない), imperative forms like 「しろ」 or 「しなさい」 are extremely unnatural and virtually never used for this specific meaning, as you cannot command something to cost a certain amount or a specific duration to pass.",
