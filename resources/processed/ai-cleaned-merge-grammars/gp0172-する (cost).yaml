    "etymology": "The verb 「する」 is a very common and versatile verb in Japanese, with many meanings depending on the context. In this case, it is used to denote the action of costing a certain amount of money or taking a certain amount of time. The fundamental meaning of 「する」 is 'to do,' but it extends to represent various actions and states.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「する」, in this specific usage, indicates the cost of something or the duration of time. It's crucial to remember that when 「する」 means \"lapse of time,\" it typically appears in a subordinate clause. For example, 「一年したら大学を出る」 (In another year, I'll graduate from college). The verb 「する」 itself is a fundamental verb meaning \"to do\", and it takes on various meanings based on context. The formality of 「する」 varies. 「します」is more polite, while 「する」is more casual. Understanding the context and formality level is key to correctly using this verb.",
