    "etymology": "「塗れ(まみれ)」 is the noun form of the verb 「塗れる(まみれる)」, which itself comes from the verb 「塗る(ぬる)」 meaning 'to paint' or 'to smear'. The grammar point retains the sense of being covered or smeared with something, similar to applying a coating. The spelling in hiragana 「まみれ」 is far more common than the kanji 「塗れ」.",
    "writeup": "「塗れ(まみれ)」, commonly written in hiragana, is a grammar pattern that describes something being completely covered, smeared, or soaked in a particular substance. It attaches directly to a noun. While it literally means 'covered with' or 'smeared with', it often carries a negative or undesirable connotation. For instance, one might be covered in mud (泥まみれ), blood (血まみれ), or sweat (汗まみれ). It can also be used for abstract concepts, most notably in expressions like 「借金まみれ」 (drowning in debt), where it implies being overwhelmed by something undesirable.\n\nIt is important to note that 「まみれ」 primarily describes something covering the **outer surface** of an object, rather than its contents. It emphasizes the pervasive and often messy nature of the covering. The expression is derived from the verb 「塗れる (まみれる)」, which shares its etymology with 「塗る (ぬる)」, meaning 'to paint' or 'to smear'. This connection highlights its focus on surface coverage.\n\nWhile occasionally encountered in more neutral contexts, its strong association with negative imagery makes it suitable for describing states that are physically unpleasant or metaphorically overwhelming.",

            "nuance": "「だらけ」 often implies a widespread scattering or an abundance of individual items (e.g., 傷だらけ 'full of scratches', ゴミだらけ 'full of trash'), while 「まみれ」 suggests a more complete and often messy saturation or coating of a surface with a single substance (e.g., 血まみれ 'covered in blood', 汗まみれ 'soaked in sweat'). 「まみれ」 emphasizes being 'smeared with' or 'drenched in', whereas 「だらけ」 emphasizes being 'full of' or 'riddled with'."

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "Both 「まみれ」 and 「だらけ」 indicate being covered or filled with something, often undesirable. However, they carry different nuances. 「まみれ」 suggests a more thorough, immersive, or smeared coating, often with a single substance like mud, blood, or sweat. It implies being drenched or completely covered on the surface. In contrast, 「だらけ」 implies being full of many individual items or scattered elements, such as scratches, dust, or mistakes. While both can be used for abstract concepts like debt, 「まみれ」 conveys being 'drowning in' or 'overwhelmed by,' whereas 「だらけ」 implies being 'full of' or 'riddled with' many instances of something.",
