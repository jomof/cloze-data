    "etymology": "「塗れ(まみれ)」 is the noun form of the verb 「塗れる(まみれる)」, which itself comes from the verb 「塗る(ぬる)」 meaning 'to paint' or 'to smear'. The grammar point retains the sense of being covered or smeared with something, similar to applying a coating. The spelling in hiragana 「まみれ」 is far more common than the kanji 「塗れ」.",
    "writeup": "「塗れ(まみれ)」, commonly written in hiragana, is a grammar pattern that describes something being completely covered, smeared, or soaked in a particular substance. It attaches directly to a noun. While it literally means 'covered with' or 'smeared with', it often carries a negative or undesirable connotation. For instance, one might be covered in mud (泥まみれ), blood (血まみれ), or sweat (汗まみれ). It can also be used for abstract concepts, most notably in expressions like 「借金まみれ」 (drowning in debt), where it implies being overwhelmed by something undesirable.\n\nIt is important to note that 「まみれ」 primarily describes something covering the **outer surface** of an object, rather than its contents. It emphasizes the pervasive and often messy nature of the covering. The expression is derived from the verb 「塗れる (まみれる)」, which shares its etymology with 「塗る (ぬる)」, meaning 'to paint' or 'to smear'. This connection highlights its focus on surface coverage.\n\nWhile occasionally encountered in more neutral contexts, its strong association with negative imagery makes it suitable for describing states that are physically unpleasant or metaphorically overwhelming.",
