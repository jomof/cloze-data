    "etymology": "「塗れ(まみれ)」 is the noun form of the verb 「塗れる(まみれる)」, which itself comes from the verb 「塗る(ぬる)」 meaning 'to paint' or 'to smear'. The grammar point retains the sense of being covered or smeared with something, similar to applying a coating.",
    "writeup": "「塗れ(まみれ)」, generally written in hiragana, is used to express that something is completely covered, smeared, stained, or soaked in something else. It attaches directly to nouns. Though it can be used for neutral descriptions, it often carries a negative connotation, referring to undesirable substances like mud, blood, or even abstract concepts like debt, as seen in forms like 「借金まみれ」. It describes something covering the outer surface of another object, rather than its contents. Note the related forms: 「塗れる(まみれる)」 (verb) and 「塗る(ぬる)」 (verb, to paint). It can also appear as 「〜まみれの」 when modifying another noun directly.",
