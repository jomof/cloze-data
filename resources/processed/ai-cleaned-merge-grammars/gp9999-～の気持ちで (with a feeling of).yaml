details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to describe the emotional or mental state that accompanies an action, highlighting
    the inner motivation or attitude of the actor.
  function: To specify the subjective internal feeling, spirit, or intention behind an action.
  nuance: Emphasizes the actor's internal state or mindset during an action, rather than just the action
    itself or its objective outcome. It can imply a certain determination or dedication.
  grammatical-role: Functions adverbially to modify the verb, describing how the action is performed.
  logical-flow: Connects an emotional or mental state to the manner in which an action is carried out.
etymology: The phrase combines the noun 「気持ち」(kimochi), meaning 'feeling' or 'mood,' with the particle
  「の」(no), functioning as a possessive or descriptive marker, and the particle 「で」(de), indicating means,
  manner, or state. Literally, it translates to 'by means of a feeling' or 'in a feeling's state,' evolving
  to convey 'with a certain mindset or intention.'
writeup: |-
  「〜の気持ちで」 is a versatile phrase used to express the mindset, feeling, or intention with which someone performs an action. While 「気持ち」 primarily means 'feeling' or 'mood,' when used with 「〜で」, it extends to encompass one's mental attitude, spirit, or determination. It often implies that the action is carried out with a specific underlying emotion or purpose.

  This expression is commonly used with nouns that describe feelings, states, or roles (e.g., 感謝の気持ちで - with a feeling of gratitude; 挑戦者の気持ちで - with the mindset of a challenger). It can also sometimes be used with verbs in their plain form, especially when emphasizing the *intention* or *belief* behind an action, although this usage is less frequent than with nouns and tends to carry a stronger sense of determination (e.g., 成功する気持ちで - with the intention to succeed).

  The key nuance of 「〜の気持ちで」 is its focus on the *subjective internal state* of the actor. It answers the question of 'how' or 'in what spirit' an action is performed, rather than just 'why' (purpose) or 'what' (firm plan). It conveys the emotional color or mental posture behind the action, making it different from simply stating a goal or a decision.

  - term: 〜つもりだ (to intend to)
    meaning: To intend to; to be convinced that; to act as if.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「つもりだ」 expresses a firm intention, a belief about a future action, or acting as if something
      is the case. In contrast, 「〜の気持ちで」 describes the *mindset* or *attitude* one has *while* performing
      an action, focusing on the emotional or mental state rather than a concrete plan or a perceived
      identity. 「つもりだ」 is about a definite resolve or understanding, whereas 「〜の気持ちで」 is about the accompanying
      sentiment.

  - term: 〜ために (for the purpose of)
    meaning: For the purpose of; in order to.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ために」 states the objective purpose or a clear goal of an action. It answers 'why' an action
      is done. 「〜の気持ちで」 specifies the subjective internal feeling, spirit, or mindset with which an action
      is carried out. While there can be overlap with 'intention,' 「〜の気持ちで」 emphasizes the *manner* or
      *attitude* of doing something, not necessarily the ultimate objective. The focus is on the internal
      state during the process, not just the outcome.

post_false_friends_writeup: 'When differentiating between 「〜の気持ちで」, 「つもりだ」, and 「ために」, consider the focus:
  「〜の気持ちで」 highlights the *internal feeling or mindset* during an action. 「つもりだ」 emphasizes a *firm intention
  or belief*. 「ために」 specifies the *objective purpose or goal* of an action. While an action done ''with
  a certain mindset'' might also have a purpose or be part of a plan, 「〜の気持ちで」 foregrounds the subjective
  emotional or mental state that drives or colors the action.'
