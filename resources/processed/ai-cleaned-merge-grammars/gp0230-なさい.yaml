    "etymology": "「なさい」 is the imperative form of the honorific verb 「なさる」 (nasaru), which means \"to do.\" Thus, it carries a nuance of respect, albeit within the framework of a command.",
    "writeup": "「なさい」 is a polite imperative form derived from the honorific verb 「なさる」, meaning \"to do.\" Although it conveys politeness, it is still a command, making it unsuitable for superiors. It is most commonly used by those in positions of authority—such as parents or teachers—to instruct those of lower status, like children or students. To use 「なさい」, simply attach it to the ます-stem of any verb (e.g., 「食べます」 becomes 「食べなさい」). A more casual, shortened form, 「な」, is also used, primarily among peers. It is crucial to distinguish this shortened 「な」, which implies a gentle suggestion or command, from the prohibitive 「な」, meaning \"don't,\" which attaches to the dictionary form of a verb. While 「なさい」 itself is gender-neutral, its usage often feels more natural when spoken by women, particularly mothers or female teachers.",
