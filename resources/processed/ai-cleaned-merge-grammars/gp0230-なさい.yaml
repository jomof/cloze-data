    "etymology": "「なさい」 is the imperative form of the honorific verb 「なさる」 (nasaru), which means \"to do.\" Thus, it carries a nuance of respect, albeit within the framework of a command.",
    "writeup": "「なさい」 is a polite imperative form derived from the honorific verb 「なさる」, meaning \"to do.\" Although it conveys politeness, it's still a command, making it unsuitable for superiors. It's most commonly used by those in positions of authority—parents, teachers—to instruct those of lower status, such as children or students. To use 「なさい」, attach it to the ます-stem of a verb (e.g., 「食べなさい」 from 「食べます」). A more casual shortening, 「な」, is also used, primarily among peers. It's important to distinguish the 「な」 that is 「なさい」 shortened from the 「な」 that means \"don't,\" since they're distinct grammatical forms. 「なさい」 is commonly used by women.",
