jlpt: N3
etymology: The particle 「の」 (no) functions as a nominalizer, evolving from a noun meaning 'thing' or 'entity.'
  This allows it to transform a clause or phrase into a noun. The particle 「を」 (o) is a direct object
  marker. Together, 「のを」 effectively reifies an action, state, or event, turning it into something that
  can be directly acted upon by a transitive verb. This combination allows for a precise focus on the
  perceived or intended action itself.
writeup: |-
  The grammatical structure 「のを」 is formed by combining the nominalizer 「の」 with the direct object particle 「を」. This combination allows you to treat a verb phrase, adjective phrase, or even a noun phrase (with 「の」) as a single noun, which then becomes the direct object of a transitive verb.

  Think of 「の」 as turning the preceding clause into 'the act of doing X,' 'the state of being Y,' or 'the fact that Z.' When followed by 「を」, it specifies *that act, state, or fact* as what the transitive verb is acting upon.

  This construction is frequently used with verbs of perception such as 「見る」 (miru - to see), 「聞く」 (kiku - to hear), 「感じる」 (kanjiru - to feel), and verbs that imply an action being carried out or remembered, like 「手伝う」 (tetsudau - to help), 「忘れる」 (wasureru - to forget), 「覚える」 (oboeru - to remember), or 「知る」 (shiru - to know). It highlights the specific event or action being objectified, rather than just the general concept.

  For example, instead of saying 「犬を見ます」 (inu o mimasu - I see a dog), which focuses on the dog, you might say 「犬が走るのを{見ます}」 (inu ga hashiru no o mimasu - I see the dog running), where the focus is on the *act of running* that the dog is doing. This distinction is crucial for expressing what you perceive or act upon.

  - term: のが
    meaning: nominalizing a clause to be used as a subject
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「のを」 marks the nominalized clause as a direct object, 「のが」 marks it as the subject of
      the sentence. The choice between them depends entirely on the grammatical role the nominalized clause
      plays.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:のが上手だ・下手だ (to be good at・bad at doing)
  - term: のは
    meaning: nominalizing a clause to be used as a topic or for contrast
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「のは」 marks the nominalized clause as the topic of the sentence or introduces it for contrast.
      It sets the stage for a comment or comparison, unlike 「のを」 which directly specifies the object of
      an action.
    grammar_point: のは (emphasis and identification)
  - term: ことを
    meaning: nominalizing a clause with 'koto' as a direct object
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ことを」 also nominalizes a clause to function as a direct object. However, 「こと」 often refers
      to more abstract concepts, general facts, or experiences. 「の」 tends to refer to more specific, concrete
      events or actions, especially those involving sensory perception.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]こと (nominalization)'
  - term: もの
    meaning: nominalizing a clause with 'mono' for explanation or natural tendency
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: When used with 「を」 (i.e., 「ものを」), 「もの」 nominalizes a clause with additional nuances such as
      expressing a natural or logical outcome, an explanation, or regret. It implies a deeper, often more
      emotional, connection to the action or state compared to the more neutral or direct observation
      conveyed by 「のを」.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]もの (nominalization)'
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate between 「のを」 and other similar nominalizing structures, focus
  on the particle that follows 「の」. If it's 「を」, the nominalized clause is the direct object. If it's
  「が」, it's the subject. If it's 「は」, it's the topic. 「こと」 and 「もの」 are also nominalizers, but 「こと」 leans
  towards abstract facts or experiences, while 「もの」 often carries explanatory or emotional undertones.
  「の」 with 「を」 is for specific, often perceived, actions or states as objects.

          - 友達 が 道 を 渡る の が 見え まし た。
        english: My friend crossing the street was visible.
        hint: 「見えました」 uses the potential form of 見る, meaning 'to be visible' or 'to be able to see', which
          focuses on the natural appearance of something rather than an active viewing. We're looking
          for an active perception.

          - 友達 が 道 を 渡っ て いる こと を 見 まし た。
        english: I saw the fact that my friend was crossing the street.

          - 彼女 は 赤ちゃん が 泣く こと を 聞き まし た。
        english: She heard (about) the fact that the baby was crying.

        english: I forgot the fact of turning off the lights.
        hint: While similar, 「こと」 can imply a more abstract concept or general event. 「の」 is often preferred
          for concrete, specific actions one forgets to do. We're looking for forgetting a specific act.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 電気 を 消し 忘れ まし た。
        english: I forgot to turn off the lights.
        hint: This uses a compound verb structure which is more concise but doesn't explicitly nominalize
          the action. We're looking for the full nominalization using の.

    register: casual
    setting: apologetic
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)

        hint: The use of 「と」 here implies feeling *that* something is happening, which is more a realization
          or thought, rather than a direct physical sensation. We're looking for direct sensation of the
          action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 地面 の 揺れ を 感じ まし た か？
        english: Did you feel the shaking of the ground?
        hint: This phrasing uses the noun 「揺れ」 (yure - shake) as the object, rather than nominalizing
          the verb. We're looking for the nominalized action.
    scene: After a slight tremor, one person asks another if they noticed it.
    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)

        english: He helps me with the fact of studying Japanese.

          - 彼 は 私 の 日本 語 の 勉強 を 手伝っ て くれ ます。
        english: He helps my Japanese study.
        hint: This phrasing uses 「勉強」 as a noun modified by 「日本語 の」, rather than nominalizing the verb
          「勉強する」. We're looking for the verb's nominalized form.
    scene: You are talking about someone who regularly helps you.
    register: teineigo (polite)

        english: I didn't know that you could speak Japanese.
        hint: Using 「と は」 emphasizes the surprising nature of the fact being learned, rather than simply

        english: I didn't know that you were able to speak Japanese.
        hint: This is a more verbose way to express ability and knowledge, using 「こと」 for nominalization

          「の」.
    scene: You just heard someone speak Japanese for the first time.

          - あなた と あの 映画 を 見 た こと を 覚え て い ます。
        english: I remember having seen that movie with you.
        hint: 「こと」 here emphasizes the *experience* of having done something in the past. 「の」 is more
          direct, referring to the specific act itself. We're looking for remembering the specific act.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あなた と あの 映画 を 見 た の が 印象 的 でし た。
        english: The fact that I saw that movie with you was impressive.
        hint: This sentence shifts the grammatical role, making the nominalized clause the subject of
          「印象的でした」 (was impressive), not the object of remembering. We're looking for the nominalized
          act as the object of memory.
    scene: You are reminiscing with a friend about past events.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)

          - 彼 は 車 が 出る こと を 止めよう と し まし た。
        english: He tried to prevent the fact that the car would leave.
        hint: 「こと」 tends to be more abstract, referring to facts or general occurrences. 「の」 is used for
          the direct perception or manipulation of an action. We're looking for preventing a specific
          action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 車 の 発進 を 止めよう と し まし た。
        english: He tried to stop the car's departure.

        hint: Using 「と」 here implies a realization or a thought, rather than a direct perception of the
          change itself. We're looking for direct observation of the changing state.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 空 の 暗く なる 様子 に 気づき まし た。
        english: I noticed the way the sky was getting dark.

        english: I don't mind the fact of you using my PC.
        hint: 「こと」 often indicates a general fact or concept, which can be acceptable here but 「の」 feels
          more natural for a specific action being granted permission for. We're looking for the direct
          nominalization of the specific action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の パソコン を 使っ て も いい です。
        english: It's fine even if you use my PC.
        hint: This is a direct expression of permission, rather than nominalizing an action as an object
          of 'not minding'. We're looking for the nominalized action as the object.
    scene: Someone asks for permission to use your computer.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「使う の を」 nominalizes the act of 'using' the computer, which is the object of '気にしない' (ki ni
      shinai - don't mind). This polite but approachable expression conveys a friendly permission.
post_example_writeup: The examples provided demonstrate how 「のを」 allows you to treat entire actions, states,
  or events as concrete objects that can be acted upon by verbs like seeing, hearing, forgetting, or helping.
  This construction is incredibly versatile and essential for expressing nuanced perceptions and interactions
  in Japanese. Notice how the nominalized clause, typically marked with 「が」 for its subject, clearly defines
  *what* is being perceived or acted upon by the main verb.
