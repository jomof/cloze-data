    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ずに」 originates from the classical Japanese negative auxiliary verb 「ず」, which is similar to 「ない」 in modern Japanese, combined with the particle 「に」. 「ず」 indicates negation, and 「に」 functions as a particle indicating manner or means. Therefore, 「ずに」 literally means 'in the state of not doing.'",
    "writeup": "「ずに」 means \"without doing.\" It is a grammatical construct derived from the classical Japanese negative auxiliary verb 「ず」, which holds a similar function to the modern negative auxiliary verb 「ない」. The particle 「に」 is appended to 「ず」, indicating the manner or state of an action being performed without the prior action occurring.\n\nTo form 「ずに」, it attaches to the **indeterminate form** (連用形 - ren'yōkei) of a verb. This is the same verb form used when connecting to 「ない」. For example, 食べる (taberu) becomes 食べ (tabe) + ずに, and 飲む (nomu) becomes 飲ま (noma) + ずに.\n\nA crucial exception exists for irregular verbs like する (suru). While its indeterminate form is typically し (shi), when combined with 「ずに」, it becomes せずに (sezu ni). This is because both せ and し are considered indeterminate forms of する, but せ is the form that traditionally pairs with 「ず」. For example, 勉強する (benkyō suru) becomes 勉強せずに (benkyō sezu ni), not 勉強しずに (benkyō shizu ni).\n\n「ずに」 is more formal and carries a slightly more literary nuance compared to 「ないで」, which is generally more common in everyday conversation. Despite its formality, 「ずに」 is frequently encountered in modern Japanese, particularly within established phrases and written contexts.",
