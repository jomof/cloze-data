    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ずに」 originates from the classical Japanese negative auxiliary verb 「ず」, which is similar to 「ない」 in modern Japanese, combined with the particle 「に」. 「ず」 indicates negation, and 「に」 functions as a particle indicating manner or means. Therefore, 「ずに」 literally means 'in the state of not doing.'",
    "writeup": "「ずに」 means \"without doing.\" It's similar to 「ないで」, but more formal. It attaches to the plain form of a verb, indicating that something is done *without* performing the action of that verb. Note that 「する」 verbs become 「せずに」, not 「しずに」. This grammar point is considered more formal and literary than 「ないで」, and appears often in fixed expressions.",
