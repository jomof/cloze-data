    "etymology": "「それとも」 is derived from 「それ」 (that), 「と」 (and), and 「も」 (also). The combination suggests 'that or also,' highlighting an alternative choice.",
    "writeup": "「それとも」 is a conjunction in Japanese that translates to \"or\" or \"otherwise.\" It highlights alternative options or choices between A and B. This structure is used only when the options are limited to either A or B. 「それとも」 typically appears after a comma or at the beginning of a new sentence.\n\nWhile often, A and B are opposites, this isn't a strict requirement.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「か」 and 「むしろ」 can sometimes be translated with 'or' or 'rather,' it's essential to understand their nuances. 「か」 is generally used in a series of options or for a simple yes/no question. 「それとも」, on the other hand, presents a clear A or B choice, often in a question format. 「むしろ」 expresses a preference or emphasizes one option as being more suitable or accurate than another, which has usually been stated or implied.",
