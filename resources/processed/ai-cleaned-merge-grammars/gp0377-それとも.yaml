    "writeup": "「それとも」 is a conjunction in Japanese that translates to \"or\" or \"otherwise.\" It highlights alternative options or choices between A and B. This structure is used only when the options are limited to either A or B. 「それとも」 typically appears after a comma or at the beginning of a new sentence.\n\nWhile often, A and B are opposites, this isn't a strict requirement.",
