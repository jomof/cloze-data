    "etymology": "ものを is derived from the noun 物 (mono, meaning 'thing') and the particle を (o). The combination implies 'regarding the thing that should have been,' expressing a sense of regret or unrealized potential. The particle を here isn't directly indicating an object; rather, it's used in a broader sense to mark the 'thing' that the speaker is focusing on with their regret.",
    "writeup": "ものを expresses regret, discontent, or a missed opportunity, similar to のに. However, ものを emphasizes a stronger feeling that something *should* have happened differently. It often translates to \"should have,\" \"could have,\" or \"if only.\" ものを typically appears at the end of a sentence, with the unspoken portion implying the undesirable outcome. It is often preceded by hypothetical structures such as the conditional ば-form. It's considered a conjunction particle, even though it is constructed from もの (thing) and the adverbial particle を.",
