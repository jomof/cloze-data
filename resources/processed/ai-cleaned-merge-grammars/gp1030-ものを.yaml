    "etymology": "ものを is derived from the noun 物 (mono, \"thing\") and the particle を (wo). The を particle in this context expresses a sense of direction or purpose, often with an unfulfilled desire or intention. The combination creates a nuance of \"regarding that thing...\" implying regret that the 'thing' didn't come to fruition.",
    "writeup": "**ものを** expresses regret, dissatisfaction, or reproach concerning a situation where a desired outcome was not achieved. It is similar to **のに** but carries a stronger sense of disappointment or frustration that something *should* have happened but didn't. It is often translated as \"but,\" \"although,\" or \"if only.\" ものを is commonly used at the end of a sentence, leaving the consequence unspoken but implied. It follows verbs and い-adjectives in their plain form, and な-adjectives are followed by な. Typically, sentences including **ものを** contain a hypothetical element, often using **ば**, highlighting the desired alternative. The particle を here indicates an ideal or goal that was not reached.",
