        "nuance": "implies a natural or resulting transformation, rather than a conscious effort or active becoming, though it can be used for both. It highlights the outcome of a process or a spontaneous shift in state or quality. The choice between になる and くなる depends on the part of speech being modified, reflecting the grammatical rules for nouns/na-adjectives and i-adjectives respectively. The irregular conjugation of 「いい」 to 「よくなる」 is a notable exception. While the base form is casual, it can be easily adapted to polite or formal speech by conjugating 'なる' (e.g., 'になります', 'になりました')."
    },
    "etymology": "「に」 is a particle indicating a direction or target of change, signifying the result or state something transforms into. 「なる」 is the foundational verb \"to become\" in Japanese. 「くなる」 is a specific grammatical conjugation used exclusively with い-adjectives to indicate a change in their degree or state. This conjugation pattern is derived from the adverbial form of い-adjectives (dropping い and adding く), which then precedes 「なる」 to denote the shift.",
    "writeup": "「になる」 with nouns and な-adjectives and 「くなる」 with い-adjectives both express the idea of \"becoming.\" This grammar point describes a change in state, condition, or quality. The verb 「なる」 can be conjugated to indicate different tenses (past, present, future) or polarity (positive, negative). While the dictionary form is casual, it can be easily adapted to polite or formal speech by conjugating 'なる', for example, 「になります」 or 「になりました」. For **い-adjectives**, you drop the final 「い」 and add 「くなる」. For example, 「大きい」 (big) becomes 「大きくなる」 (to become big). For **な-adjectives** and **nouns**, you add 「になる」. For example, 「元気」 (healthy) becomes 「元気 に なる」 (to become healthy). There is a notable exception: the i-adjective 「いい」 (good) conjugates irregularly to 「よくなる」, not 「いくなる」.",

The related forms 「～にする/くする」 are transitive verbs, meaning they indicate an agent actively making something change, whereas 「～になる/くなる」 are intransitive, indicating something changes on its own.",
