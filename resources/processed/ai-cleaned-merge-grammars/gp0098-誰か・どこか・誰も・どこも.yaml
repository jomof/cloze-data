    "etymology": "These grammatical constructions combine the interrogative pronouns 「誰 (dare)」 (who) and 「どこ (doko)」 (where) with the particles 「か (ka)」 and 「も (mo)」. Historically, 「か」 functions as a marker of uncertainty or interrogation, leading to the sense of 'some-'. The particle 「も」, when used with interrogatives in affirmative sentences, generally means 'also' or 'even'. However, when combined with interrogatives in negative sentences, it functions to negate the entirety of the referent, yielding meanings like 'no one' or 'nowhere'. This dual function of 「も」 highlights its semantic versatility in Japanese.",
    "writeup": "The phrases **誰か (dareka)** and **どこか (dokoka)** are employed in affirmative statements to denote an unspecified person or place, translating to \"someone\" or \"somewhere.\" Conversely, **誰も (daremo)** and **どこも (dokomo)** are utilized in negative constructions to convey \"no one\" or \"nowhere.\"\n\nIt is important to note that the usage of 誰 and どこ is not confined solely to the particles か and も. They can indeed be combined with other particles such as へ, に, or と to impart more specific semantic nuances regarding direction, location, or association.\n\nObserve that in affirmative sentences, か invariably precedes any other particle (e.g., 誰か に). This is because か attaches directly to the interrogative word to form the indefinite pronoun/adverb. In contrast, も consistently follows other particles when creating the negative indefinite form (e.g., 誰に も, どこへ も). This structural difference reflects that か modifies the preceding noun-like element, while も operates on the entire phrase, contributing to the comprehensive negation.\n\nWhile も is primarily associated with negative sentences in this context, it is not exclusively restricted to them. It can also appear in affirmative contexts, typically conveying the meaning of \"also\" or \"even,\" further underscoring its broad application. For instance, 「誰もが」 means \"everyone\" or \"everybody,\" and 「どこもかしこも」 means \"everywhere\" or \"all over the place.\"",
