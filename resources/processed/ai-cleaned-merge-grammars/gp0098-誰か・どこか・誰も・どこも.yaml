    "etymology": "These words are derived from 「誰 (dare)」 meaning \"who\" and 「どこ (doko)」 meaning \"where\", combined with the particles 「か (ka)」 and 「も (mo)」. 「か」 generally indicates a question or uncertainty, while 「も」 can indicate \"also\" or \"even,\" but in this case, it contributes to the negative meaning when used with 「誰」 and 「どこ」.",
    "writeup": "The constructions 誰か and どこか are used in positive sentences to refer to \"someone\" or \"somewhere.\" Conversely, 誰も and どこも are used in negative sentences to mean \"no one\" or \"nowhere.\" As noted earlier in lesson 誰, using 誰 or どこ isn't limited to just the particles か and も; they can also be combined with へ, に, or と to add more specific meaning.\n\nAs demonstrated in the examples, か will always precede any other particle in a positive sentence. The opposite is true for も, which will always follow other particles in negative sentences. This is because か directly modifies the noun, whereas も modifies the entire phrase, not just the noun.\n\nNote that も is not restricted to negative sentences, as seen in one of the examples. It can also be used in positive sentences to mean \"also.\"",
