    "etymology": "These words are derived from the interrogatives 誰 (dare - who) and どこ (doko - where), combined with the particles か (ka) and も (mo).  か indicates an indefinite 'some' or 'any', while も, when used with a negative verb, indicates 'not even' or 'not at all'. Thus, 誰か and どこか imply 'someone' and 'somewhere' respectively, while 誰も and どこも, when used with negative verbs, mean 'no one' and 'nowhere'.",
    "writeup": "The terms 誰か (dareka) and どこか (dokoka) are used to refer to \"someone\" or \"somewhere\" in positive contexts. Conversely, 誰も (daremo) and どこも (dokomo) are employed to express \"no one\" or \"nowhere\" in negative statements. This usage extends beyond just the particles か and も; they can also combine with particles like へ (e), に (ni), or と (to) to add specific nuances.  \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   In positive sentences, か (ka) will always precede any other particle modifying the noun directly.\n*   In negative sentences, も (mo) typically follows other particles because it often modifies the entire phrase, not just the noun.\n*   も (mo) is not exclusively limited to negative sentences; it can appear in positive sentences with a different meaning (e.g., 'also').",
