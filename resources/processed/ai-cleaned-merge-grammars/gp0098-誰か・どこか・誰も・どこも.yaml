    "etymology": "These words are derived from 「誰 (dare)」 meaning \"who\" and 「どこ (doko)」 meaning \"where\", combined with the particles 「か (ka)」 and 「も (mo)」. 「か」 generally indicates a question or uncertainty, while 「も」 can indicate \"also\" or \"even,\" but in this case, it contributes to the negative meaning when used with 「誰」 and 「どこ」.",
    "writeup": "The constructions 誰か and どこか are employed in affirmative statements to denote \"someone\" or \"somewhere.\" Conversely, 誰も and どこも are utilized in negative constructions to convey \"no one\" or \"nowhere.\" As previously discussed in the lesson on 誰, the use of 誰 or どこ is not confined to the particles か and も; they can indeed be combined with へ, に, or とを to impart more specific semantic nuances.\n\nObserve that か invariably precedes any other particle in affirmative sentences. Conversely, も consistently follows other particles in negative sentences. This distinction arises because か directly modifies the preceding noun, whereas も functions to modify the entire phrase, not merely the noun.\n\nIt is important to note that も is not exclusively confined to negative sentences, as exemplified by certain uses. It can also appear in affirmative contexts, typically conveying the meaning of \"also.\"",
