    "etymology": "「一切」 originally comes from Buddhist terminology, referring to \"everything\" or \"all.\" When used with a negative verb, it creates the meaning of \"not at all\" or \"nothing at all.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「一切〜ない」 (issai ~ nai) is used to express a complete negation, meaning \"not at all,\" \"absolutely not,\" or \"not whatsoever.\" It emphasizes that something is entirely absent or does not occur in any way. 「一切」 is an adverb that intensifies the negative meaning of the verb or adjective. It is often used in formal settings, writing, or when making a strong, definitive statement. While it can sometimes be interchangeable with 「全然〜ない」 or 「全く〜ない」, 「一切〜ない」 consistently carries a stronger and more formal tone, conveying a sense of zero tolerance or absolute denial.",
