    "etymology": "「一切」originally comes from Buddhist terminology, referring to \"everything\" or \"all.\" When used with a negative verb, it creates the meaning of \"not at all\" or \"nothing at all.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「一切〜ない」 (issai ~ nai) is used to express a complete negation, meaning \"not at all,\" \"absolutely not,\" or \"not whatsoever.\" It emphasizes that something is entirely absent or does not occur in any way. 「一切」 is an adverb that intensifies the negative meaning of the verb. It's often used in formal settings, writing, or when making a strong statement. It can be interchangeable with 「全然〜ない」 or 「全く〜ない」, but 「一切〜ない」 carries a stronger and more formal tone.",
