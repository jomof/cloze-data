meaning: Result; outcome; as a result of; as a consequence of
pronunciation:
  katakana: ケッカ・ノケッカ
  romaji: kekka / no kekka
formation:
  Verb, past form + 結果: Indicates the outcome that materialized from a past action.
  Noun + の + 結果: Indicates the outcome that materialized from a situation or event denoted by the noun,
    functioning as 'as a result of the Noun'.
jlpt: N2
details:
  register: formal
  usage-context: general
  function: Indicates a conclusive outcome or consequence of a preceding action or situation.
  grammatical-role: Nouns or nominalized clauses that act as the cause or preceding event, with the following
    clause describing the resulting outcome.
  logical-flow: Implies a direct cause-and-effect relationship, where the event described by 結果 is the
    direct consequence of the preceding action/situation.
  temporal-flow: The event preceding 結果 must occur before the outcome, establishing a clear temporal sequence
    from cause to effect.
etymology: 「結果 (kekka)」 literally means "result" or "outcome." This grammar point uses this noun to indicate
  a cause-and-effect relationship, where something happens 「の結果」 of a preceding action or situation. Its
  roots connect to the idea of a final state or fruit (果) of an action or process (結), embodying the completion
  and outcome of an event.
writeup: The grammar point 「結果 (kekka)」, meaning "result" or "outcome," is used to clearly state that
  one event or situation is the direct consequence or final conclusion of another. It functions much like
  saying "as a result of (A), (B)" in English, emphasizing the cause-and-effect relationship. You will
  typically see 「結果」 connected to a verb in its past tense (た-form) or to a noun followed by the particle
  の. This structure highlights that the preceding action or state directly led to the subsequent outcome.
  Unlike some other expressions that denote causality, such as 「あげく」, 「結果」 is neutral in its connotation.
  It can describe either a positive, negative, or neutral outcome. Its primary function is simply to identify
  the precise cause that led to a specific final conclusion. This makes it a versatile and commonly used
  expression in both written and spoken Japanese when you want to make a clear statement about an outcome
  and its direct antecedent. Think of 「結果」 as explicitly drawing a line from a cause to its definitive
  effect, making the logical flow of events very clear.
false_friends:
  - term: その結果
    meaning: As a result
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「その結果」 is used more as a conjunctive adverb to introduce a direct consequence in a narrative,
      emphasizing the logical flow between sentences or paragraphs, whereas 「結果」 (when connected directly
      to a clause) establishes the cause-effect relationship more directly within a single sentence.
    grammar_point: その結果 (as a result)
  - term: あげく
    meaning: In the end; after all
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「結果」, which can denote both positive and negative outcomes, 「あげく」 is typically used
      when the end result is negative or undesirable, often implying a sense of futility, disappointment,
      or a culmination of negative events.
    grammar_point: あげく (culmination of effort)
  - term: 〜ため
    meaning: because of; due to; for the purpose of
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「結果」 focuses on the definitive, conclusive outcome that materializes from an action
      or event, 「〜ため」 primarily indicates the reason or cause for something, or its purpose. 「結果」 implies
      a more direct and final consequence, whereas 「〜ため」 often describes an ongoing or contributing factor.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary・Nounの]ために (for the purpose of)'
  - term: 〜によって
    meaning: due to; by means of; depending on
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「〜によって」 often specifies the means, method, agent, or cause through which something occurred,
      or indicates a basis for something. While it can convey causality, 「結果」 specifically points to the
      final, materialized outcome or consequence, emphasizing the finished state of affairs rather than
      the process or agent.
    grammar_point: '[Noun]によって (means・method)'
  - term: したがって
    meaning: Therefore, Thus, As a result
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「したがって」 indicates a logical consequence or a formal conclusion stemming from a preceding statement
      or situation, often used as a conjunctive adverb. While 「結果」 focuses on the specific, often tangible,
      outcome of a direct action or event, 「したがって」 links broader logical connections between sentences
      or ideas.
    grammar_point: したがって (therefore)
  - term: ことから
    meaning: From the fact that; because; due to; given that.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「ことから」 explains the reason or basis from which an inference or conclusion is drawn, often
      translating to 'from the fact that' or 'because of'. It emphasizes the factual foundation for a
      statement. In contrast, 「結果」 explicitly states the concrete outcome that directly materialized from
      an action or state.
    grammar_point: ことから (from the fact that)
  - term: 原因 で
    meaning: due to; cause
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「が 原因 で」 explicitly states the 'cause'. In contrast, 「結果」 specifically points to the final,
      materialized outcome or consequence, emphasizing the finished state of affairs rather than the process
      or agent.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:原因・で (cause)
  - term: せい で
    meaning: because of; due to (negative connotation)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「〜せい で」 implies a negative cause and usually carries a nuance of blame or undesirable outcome.
      「結果」 is neutral and simply states the definitive outcome.
    grammar_point: 〜おかげで・〜せいで (because of, positive・negative result)
  - term: から
    meaning: because of; from
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「から」 simply states a reason or cause. 「結果」 explicitly points to the definitive, materialized
      outcome of an action or event.
    grammar_point: '[Clause]から (because・so)'
  - term: の で
    meaning: because of; since
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「ので」 indicates a reason or cause, often providing an explanation. 「結果」 emphasizes the definite
      outcome derived from an action or situation.
    grammar_point: '[Clause]から (because・so)'
  - term: て形 (te-form)
    meaning: connecting actions in sequence
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: The て-form simply connects actions in sequence or indicates a state. 「結果」 highlights a definitive
      decision or outcome as a direct result of the preceding action or state.
    grammar_point: Verb[て] (and then)
  - term: おかげで
    meaning: thanks to, because of
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「おかげで」 implies gratitude or credit for a positive outcome, whereas 「結果」 is a neutral statement
      of cause and effect. 「おかげで」 is used when you are thankful for something, while 「結果」 is more objective.
    grammar_point: 〜おかげで・〜せいで (because of, positive・negative result)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing 「結果」 from similar expressions, remember that 「結果」 serves
  as a neutral connector between a preceding event and its definitive outcome, whether good or bad. For
  instance, 「その結果」 functions as a narrative bridge between sentences, signaling a direct consequence,
  while 「結果」 within a single sentence points to the outcome of a specific action. In contrast, 「あげく」 carries
  a strong negative connotation, reserving its use for unfortunate or disappointing conclusions. Likewise,
  「〜ため」 is more about conveying the reason or cause, and 「〜によって」 often highlights the means or agent.
  While these can imply causality, 「結果」 specifically emphasizes the final product of an event. For logical
  deductions or formal connections between statements, 「したがって」 is used, indicating a conclusion drawn
  from previous information rather than a direct outcome of the event. Similarly, 「から」 and 「ので」 simply
  state a reason. Expressions like 「が 原因 で」 or 「〜せい で」 explicitly attribute cause, with 「せい で」 carrying
  a negative nuance of blame. The simple て-form primarily links actions chronologically without emphasizing
  a conclusive outcome. By focusing on these nuanced differences, you can choose the most appropriate
  expression to convey the precise relationship between events.

      register fits the personal sharing of success. While 「できた」 is not gender-specific, the context of
      a young male athlete often implies a certain directness.

      の 指示 に 従わなかった」 directly resulted in their condition worsening 「病状 が 悪化して しまった」. The formal register
      and apologetic setting emphasize the seriousness of the self-admitted consequence. The final 「しました」
      adds a level of polite regret to the male doctor, typical in a formal medical consultation.

      setting are typical for public announcements, where precise cause-and-effect relationships are important
      for clarity and accountability. The use of 「〜の 結果」 frames the long process as the direct antecedent
      to the conclusive approval.
