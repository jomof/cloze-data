formation:
  Verb[た] + 結果: Used to state the outcome or consequence of a past action.

jlpt: N3
etymology: 「結果」 (kekka) comes from the kanji 「結」 (ketsu, meaning to tie, bind, conclude) and 「果」 (ka,
  meaning fruit, result, outcome). Historically, it literally refers to the "fruit" or "outcome" of a
  process or effort, similar to how a tree bears fruit after blooming. This conceptualization extends
  to abstract results, signifying the conclusion or consequence of an action or event. The particle 「の」
  functions as a possessive, indicating that the result "belongs to" or is "derived from" the preceding
  noun. When used with a verb in the past tense (た形), it implies that the completed action led directly
  to the result.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point `[Verb-た・Nounの]結果` is used to express that something is the direct consequence or outcome of a preceding action or situation. It clearly links a cause or an event to its resulting effect.

  This pattern is versatile and can be applied to various situations, from daily events to more formal reports. It functions similarly to "as a result of," "due to," or "in consequence of" in English.

  When connecting to a verb, the verb must be in its past tense (た形), indicating a completed action that has led to the result. For example, 「努力した結果、成功した」 (As a result of effort, I succeeded). Here, the completed action of "effort" (努力した) directly leads to "success" (成功した).

  When connecting to a noun, the particle 「の」 is used to link the noun to 「結果」. This noun typically represents an event, a decision, or a cause. For instance, 「会議の結果、決定した」 (As a result of the meeting, a decision was made). The noun 「会議」 (meeting) is identified as the source of the result.

  While it specifies a direct cause-and-effect relationship, it does not inherently carry a positive or negative connotation, unlike similar expressions such as 「〜おかげで」 (positive outcome) or 「〜せいで」 (negative outcome). The nuance of the result (positive, negative, or neutral) is determined by the context of the sentence itself.
false_friends:
  - term: 〜おかげで (because of, positive result)
    meaning: due to (positive outcome)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both `〜結果` and `〜おかげで` indicate a cause and effect, `〜おかげで` specifically implies that
      the preceding action/event led to a positive or beneficial outcome, often with a nuance of gratitude
      or appreciation. `〜結果` is neutral.
    grammar_point: 〜おかげで・〜せいで (because of, positive・negative result)
  - term: 〜せいで (because of, negative result)
    meaning: due to (negative outcome/blame)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`〜せいで` implies that the preceding action/event led to a negative or undesirable outcome,
      often with a nuance of blame or regret. `〜結果` is neutral.'
    grammar_point: 〜おかげで・〜せいで (because of, positive・negative result)
  - term: 〜ため (because of)
    meaning: due to; for the sake of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜ため」 can indicate a reason or cause, but it doesn't always convey the sense of a definitive
      outcome or conclusion in the same way 「〜結果」 does. It's more about the reason why something happened,
      rather than the final consequence of something.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-casual・い-Adj・な-Adjな・Nounの]ため(に) (because of・due to)'
  - term: 〜によって (due to; by means of)
    meaning: by; due to; according to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜によって」 can denote a cause or means, but 「〜結果」 specifically emphasizes the final result or
      conclusion of a process or action, whereas 「〜によって」 can describe the agent or method that led to
      something.
    grammar_point: '[Noun]によって (cause・reason)'
post_false_friends_writeup: While expressions like `〜おかげで`, `〜せいで`, `〜ため`, and `〜によって` all relate to causality,
  `〜結果` stands out by its explicit focus on the definitive outcome or consequence. `〜おかげで` and `〜せいで`
  carry inherent positive or negative connotations, respectively, whereas `〜結果` remains neutral, simply
  presenting what transpired. `〜ため` often emphasizes the reason for an action, and `〜によって` can describe
  the means or agent, but `〜結果` is about the final, tangible result that emerged from a preceding state
  or action. When you want to clearly state "this is what happened *as a result of* that," `〜結果` is the
  most direct choice.

        english: Because I stayed up late every night (negative nuance), my health deteriorated.
        hint: 「〜せいで」 (sei de) strongly implies a negative reason or blame, while 「〜結果」 (kekka) presents
          the outcome neutrally, even if the outcome itself is negative. We're looking for the factual
          outcome.

    japanese:
      - やっ て {み た 結果}、意外 と 楽しかっ た。

          - やっ て {み たら}、意外 と 楽しかっ た。
        english: When I tried it, it was surprisingly enjoyable.
        hint: 「〜たら」 (tara) is a conditional and often implies a sequence but doesn't explicitly state

          for the consequence.

        english: The announcement of the election will be made this evening.
        hint: This sentence is grammatically correct but changes the focus. The original emphasizes that
          the *results* themselves are what will be announced, not just a general announcement. We're
          looking for the specific results.
    scene: A news anchor reporting on an election.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: This is a standard, neutral announcement. The use of the passive voice 「発表される」 makes it objective,
      common in news reporting.

        hint: The te-form 「考えて」 (kangaete) implies a sequence but doesn't explicitly state the decision
          is a *result*. 「〜結果」 (kekka) clearly presents it as a consequence. We're looking for the consequence.

          - 人間 の あらゆる 行為 は 何 ら か の {実} を 生む。
        english: All human actions bear some fruit.
        hint: 「実」 (mi) means fruit, which can metaphorically mean results, but 「結果」 (kekka) is the more
          direct and common word for "result" in this philosophical context. We're looking for "result"
          in a general sense.
    scene: A philosopher giving a lecture.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The academic register and abstract concept of "human actions" (人間のあらゆる行為) make this sentence
      appropriate for a lecture setting. 「結果」 here denotes a universal truth about causality.

    japanese:
      - 自分 の 行動 {し た 結果} に は 責任 を 持つ べき だ。
      - 自分 の 行動 {し た 結果} に は 責任 を 持つ べき です。
    english_literally: Own action's done result, responsibility should have.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 自分 の 行動 {に 対する} 責任 を 持つ べき だ。
        english: You should take responsibility for your actions.
        hint: This sentence is also correct but loses the specific nuance of "results" of actions. The
          original explicitly states the responsibility for the *consequences* of actions. We're looking
          for responsibility for the outcome.
    scene: A parent advising their child.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The phrase 「持つべきだ」 (should have/bear) is a common way for an older person to impart wisdom
      or instruction to a younger person, emphasizing accountability for the consequences of one's actions.
      「行動した結果」 clearly links the action to the outcome.

    japanese:
      - その 戦争 は 我が 国 に とっ て 不利 {な 結果} と なっ た。
      - その 戦争 は 我が 国 に とっ て 不利 {な 結果} と なり まし た。
    english_literally: That war our country for unfavorable result became.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 戦争 は 我が 国 に とっ て 不利 {な 終わり 方} と なっ た。
        english: That war ended in an unfavorable way for our country.
        hint: While 「終わり方」 (owarikata) describes the manner of ending, 「結果」 (kekka) specifically refers
          to the final state or consequence. We're looking for the ultimate outcome.
    scene: A historian recounting past events.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The use of 「我が国」 (wagakuni - our country) is formal and often used in historical or national
      contexts. 「不利な結果となった」 directly describes the final, negative outcome for the nation.
post_example_writeup: The examples provided illustrate how `[Verb-た・Nounの]結果` is used across various contexts,
  from casual conversation to formal academic discourse. Notice how the preceding element, whether a verb
  in its past tense or a noun followed by 「の」, clearly sets up the cause or event, leading directly to
  the stated result. This structure makes it a highly effective way to explain direct causal links in
  Japanese.
