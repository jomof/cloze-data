    },
    "etymology": "This 「って」 is a colloquial shortening of 「と言って」 (to i tte), which literally means \"saying\". It evolved to introduce topics that are already understood or being discussed.",
    "writeup": "「って」 is a colloquial particle used to introduce a topic or something that the speaker and listener are both aware of. It's similar to saying \"speaking of\" or \"talking about\" in English. It's a very informal expression. Be careful using it with な-adjectives. You shouldn't use the stem of a な-adjective directly before 「って」 unless that adjective can also be used as a noun. For example, you can say 「健康って」 (kenkou tte, \"speaking of health\"), but not 「きれいって」 (kirei tte) directly.",
