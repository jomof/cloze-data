    "writeup": "**に対して (ni taishite)** expresses a relationship, often of contrast or opposition, between two things. It can mean \"towards,\" \"in contrast to,\" or \"regarding.\" It highlights the relationship between two subjects, indicating how they differ or how one acts in relation to the other.\n\n*   対する (taisuru) itself means \"to face\" or \"to oppose.\"\n*   に対して often emphasizes differences between (A) and (B), similar to \"whereas\" in English.\n*   It can be used to express feelings or attitudes toward a person or thing.",
