jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used to express the extent or limit of a condition, action, or state. Can convey 'as
    long as,' 'as far as,' or 'to the utmost.' Often found in more formal or written contexts, but also
    in spoken language for emphasis.
  function: To specify a condition's duration or scope, or to indicate performing an action to its maximum
    possible degree.
  nuance: Implies a boundary or full commitment within that boundary. When used with verbs, it emphasizes
    the continuation of a state or action. With nouns, it highlights the exhaustive use or reach of a
    resource or concept.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a restrictive clause or an adverbial modifier.
etymology: The word 限り (kagiri) is derived from the verb 限る (kagiru), meaning 'to limit,' 'to restrict,'
  or 'to confine.' Its use in expressions such as 「知る限り」 (as far as one knows) or 「力の限り」 (to the limit
  of one's strength) directly reflects this root meaning. It evolved to emphasize acting or understanding
  within a certain boundary or to the maximum extent of one's capabilities, essentially defining the 'limit'
  or 'extent' of something.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「限り」 (kagiri) is a versatile expression used to denote a limit, extent, or duration. It can be understood as 'as long as,' 'as far as,' or 'to the utmost of.' Its usage primarily falls into three main patterns:

  **1. Verb[dictionary form] + 限り (as long as)**
  This pattern signifies that something will continue or be true as long as the condition expressed by the verb holds. It sets a continuous boundary for the main clause's action or state. For instance, 「生きている限り」 (as long as I live) implies that a certain condition will persist throughout one's life.

  **2. Noun + の + 限り (to the limit of, as far as)**
  This structure indicates acting or knowing to the maximum extent of the specified noun. It's often used with abstract nouns like 力 (chikara, strength), 知識 (chishiki, knowledge), or 記憶 (kioku, memory). For example, 「力の限り頑張ります」 (I will do my best to the limit of my strength) conveys giving one's absolute maximum effort.

  **3. Noun + 限り (limited to, only)**
  This particular pattern, often found in official announcements or rules, restricts something to a specific category or group. For example, 「女性限り」 (limited to women) or 「会員限り」 (members only) means that access or eligibility is restricted exclusively to that group. While related by the core meaning of 'limit', its application is more about exclusivity rather than scope or duration of action, distinguishing it slightly from the other two patterns discussed.

  It is important to understand the context to correctly interpret 「限り」, as its nuance shifts slightly depending on the preceding word. It is generally a formal or semi-formal expression, though it can be used in casual speech for emphasis. The particle 「の」 is crucial when connecting it to nouns, except in the specific case of 'Noun + 限り' indicating restriction.
false_friends:
  - term: 〜だけ (only・just)
    meaning: only; just
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だけ」 emphasizes exclusivity or limitation in a simpler, more direct way. While 「限り」 can also
      denote exclusivity (Noun + 限り), its primary use in 'Verb[dictionary form] + 限り' and 'Noun + の +
      限り' focuses on the extent or duration of a state/action. 「だけ」 is more about quantity or scope, often
      implying 'nothing more' or 'nothing else'.
    grammar_point: だけ (only・just)
  - term: 〜まで (until・to the extent of)
    meaning: until; to the extent of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「まで」 primarily indicates a temporal or spatial endpoint, or a surprising extent. While it
      can convey 'to the extent of', it doesn't carry the same nuance of 'as long as a condition holds'
      or 'to the absolute limit of ability' as 「限り」 does.
    grammar_point: まで (limit extent)
  - term: 〜うちに (while or within)
    meaning: while; during; within
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「うちに」 emphasizes that something must happen while a condition exists or before a change occurs,
      often with a sense of urgency. 「限り」 indicates that something continues as long as a condition holds,
      without the same urgency or implication of change.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary・い-Adj・な-Adj・Nounの]うちに (while a state continues)'
  - term: '[Noun]限り (limited to)'
    meaning: limited to; only
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Though sharing the same word 「限り」, this specific formation is typically used to state a restriction
      or exclusivity (e.g., 'members only', 'for women only'). The primary grammar point '限り (limit・extent)'
      focuses on the scope, duration, or maximum extent of an action or knowledge, not exclusivity.
    grammar_point: '[Noun]限り (limited to)'
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing 「限り」 from similar expressions like 「だけ」, 「まで」, and 「うちに」,
  consider the specific nuance. 「限り」 emphasizes the **full extent or duration** of something, often with
  a sense of boundary. 「だけ」 is more about **exclusivity or quantity**. 「まで」 typically indicates a **temporal
  or spatial endpoint**. 「うちに」 implies an action must be completed **during a period** or **before a change**
  occurs, often with urgency. The specific pattern 'Noun + 限り' (without 'の') is unique in its direct assertion
  of limitation to a group or category, setting it apart from the 'limit/extent' usage.
