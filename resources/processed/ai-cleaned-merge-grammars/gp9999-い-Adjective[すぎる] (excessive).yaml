pronunciation:
  katakana: スギル
  romaji: sugiru
formation:
  い-Adjective[stem] + すぎる: Indicates that the state described by the i-adjective is excessive. The い is
    dropped and すぎる is attached.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The verb すぎる (sugiru) means 'to pass,' 'to exceed,' or 'to go too far.' When affixed to the
  stem of an i-adjective, it carries this meaning of 'excess' or 'overdoing,' indicating that the quality
  or state described by the adjective is beyond an appropriate or desirable limit. This grammatical construction
  reflects the original verbal meaning of 'exceeding' a standard or boundary.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「〜すぎる」 is used to indicate that something is 'too much' or 'excessive'. It attaches to the stem of い-adjectives, which means you drop the final 「い」 from the adjective and then add 「すぎる」. The resulting phrase then behaves like an Ichidan verb (a verb that ends in -る, like 食べる or 見る), and can be conjugated into various forms such as past tense, negative, te-form, and so on.

  This construction often carries a negative nuance, implying that the degree of the adjective is undesirable, inappropriate, or problematic. For example, something might be 「高すぎる」 (taka-sugiru - too expensive), which is usually a complaint, or 「忙しすぎる」 (isogashi-sugiru - too busy), suggesting an undesirable workload.

  While 「すぎる」 can be applied to many adjectives, its use highlights a departure from a normal or acceptable standard, emphasizing the negative consequences of that excess. It’s a very common expression in everyday Japanese to comment on situations that have gone beyond an optimal point.
false_friends:
  - term: い-Adjective[そう]
    meaning: seems, looks like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜そう」 expresses an appearance or conjecture based on observation, meaning 'it looks like X'
      or 'it seems X'. In contrast, 「〜すぎる」 states that something *is* excessively X, often with a negative
      implication.
    grammar_point: い-Adjective[そう] (appearance)
  - term: な-Adjective[すぎる]
    meaning: excessive
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express excessiveness, this form attaches to the stem of な-adjectives (dropping
      the な). The core meaning of 'too much' or 'excessive' remains the same.
    grammar_point: な-Adjective[すぎる] (excessive)
  - term: あまり ない
    meaning: not very, not much
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「あまり〜ない」 indicates a moderate lack or scarcity, meaning 'not very' or 'not much'. This is
      the opposite of 「〜すぎる」, which denotes an abundance or excess.
    grammar_point: あまり ない (not very or much)
post_false_friends_writeup: It is important to distinguish between 「〜すぎる」 and 「〜そう」. While both can be
  attached to adjectives, 「〜そう」 describes what *appears* to be the case (e.g., 「美味しそう」 means 'looks delicious'),
  whereas 「〜すぎる」 describes an actual state of excess (e.g., 「美味しすぎる」 means 'too delicious', possibly implying
  it's overly rich or sweet). The latter often carries a connotation that the excess is problematic or
  undesirable. Additionally, remember that 「すぎる」 can also attach to verbs and noun forms to indicate excessive
  actions or quantities, such as 「食べすぎる」 (tabesugiru - to eat too much) or 「勉強しすぎる」 (benkyou shisugiru
  - to study too much).

          - この リンゴ は あまり 酸っぱく ない。
        english: This apple is not very sour.

    register: casual

    setting: emergency/alarm
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)

        english: If you eat sweet things, it's not good for your health.
        hint: This implies that simply eating sweet things is bad. The original sentence emphasizes that
          eating an *excessive amount* is bad for health. We're looking for a verb with すぎる attached to
          it.
    scene: A parent is advising their child about healthy eating habits.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: conditional (～たら)
    nuance: While this example uses 「食べすぎる」 (a verb with すぎる), it demonstrates the same principle of excess.

      from the excessive action.

          emphasizes that his sadness was *so intense* that it prevented him from speaking.
    scene: Narrating an emotional event.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: 「悲しすぎて」 (kanashisugite) uses the te-form of 「悲しすぎる」 to express that the sadness was so overwhelming
      it caused him to be unable to speak. The excessive degree of the emotion directly led to the consequence.

      - この 話 は {良 すぎ ます} から、本当 で は あり ませ ん。

        hint: This simply states the story is good. The original implies that it's *unbelievably* good,
          so much so that it can't be true. We're looking for the sense of 'too good'.
    scene: Someone hears an incredible tale and expresses disbelief.
    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「良すぎる」 (yosugiru) implies that the story is so exceedingly good that it becomes suspicious
      or hard to believe. While 'good' is positive, 'too good' suggests an unrealistic or deceptive quality.

        english: I heard this year's exam was easy.
        hint: This just states the exam was easy. 「簡単すぎた」 conveys that it was *excessively* easy, implying
          it might have been unfair or didn't properly test knowledge. We're looking for the past tense
          of 'too easy'.
    scene: Two students discussing their university entrance exams.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: academic
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: 「簡単すぎた」 (kantan sugita - past tense of easy-too-much) expresses the idea that the exam's ease
      was beyond a reasonable level, perhaps leading to questions about its effectiveness or the difficulty
      curve.
