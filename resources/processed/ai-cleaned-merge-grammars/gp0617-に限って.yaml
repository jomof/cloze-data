    "writeup": "The expression 「に限って」 is used to express a limitation, exception, or something unexpected. It can convey several nuances:\n\n*   **Unbelievable situation:** It indicates that something is unbelievable about a particular person or thing. It highlights a contrast between what is expected and what actually happened.\n*   **Limitation:** It expresses that something is limited to a specific case or situation.\n*   **Frequent occurrence:** It highlights that something is often true in most cases concerning a particular person or thing.\n\nWhile the translation can often be rendered as \"only when,\" it's important to consider the context to determine the precise meaning. It's **crucial** to understand the underlying nuance when interpreting sentences with 「に限って」.",
