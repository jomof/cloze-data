    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に限って」 is formed from 「に」 (a particle indicating a specific condition or scope) and 「限って」, which is the te-form of the verb 「限る」 (kagiru) meaning \"to limit\" or \"restrict\". Thus, 「に限って」 literally means \"limited to\" or \"only in the case of.\"",
    "writeup": "The expression 「に限って」 in Japanese has several key uses. Primarily, it indicates a limitation or exception, often implying disbelief or unexpectedness. Depending on the context, it can mean \"only when,\" \"especially when,\" \"particularly when,\" or refer to \"those who\" or \"the only ones who\" exhibit a certain trait or experience. It often carries a nuance of surprise or disbelief that something is true about a specific person, thing, or situation. Be careful about using it though, since sometimes it can imply an unnecessary or rude level of judgement.",
