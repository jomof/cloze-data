        "source": "Japanese language resources",
        "counterpoint": "Differs from simple expressions like 'だけ' (only) or '～の時だけ' (only when) by adding a strong nuance of unexpectedness, irony, or disbelief. It often implies a negative or inconvenient outcome.",

    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に限って」 is formed from 「に」 (a particle indicating a specific condition or scope, similar to \"at\" or \"in\") and 「限って」, which is the te-form of the verb 「限る」 (kagiru), meaning \"to limit\" or \"restrict.\" Thus, 「に限って」 literally means \"limited to\" or \"only in the case of.\" Over time, its usage expanded to convey a sense of exception, emphasis on a particular instance, or ironic timing.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「に限って」 in Japanese has several key uses. Primarily, it indicates a limitation or exception, often implying disbelief or unexpectedness. Depending on the context, it can mean \"only when,\" \"especially when,\" \"particularly when,\" or refer to \"those who\" or \"the only ones who\" exhibit a certain trait or experience.\n\nIt often carries a nuance of surprise or disbelief that something is true about a specific person, thing, or situation. When used with people, it can express strong trust in someone, implying, \"It couldn't possibly be *that person*.\" Conversely, it can also be used cynically to point out a common, often negative, tendency of a group, suggesting, \"*Those* kinds of people always do X.\"\n\nBe careful about using it though, since sometimes it can imply an unnecessary or rude level of judgement, especially when expressing a cynical observation about a group.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene emphasizes the owner's disbelief and the dog's usual temperament, steering the learner towards the 'of all things/people' nuance of 「に限って」 rather than a simple statement of fact. The original sentence did not convey the 'of all things/people' nuance very clearly."

The phrase 「うちの大人しい犬に{限って}」 highlights the exceptional nature of this behavior, implying it's contrary to the dog's usual quiet disposition. The 「なんて、信じられない」 reinforces the surprise and disbelief.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene sets up a sense of ironic timing and repeated misfortune, which 「に限って」 conveys more strongly than a neutral 'だけ'. 'だけ' simply states exclusivity, while 'に限って' suggests an unfavorable or unexpected exclusivity."

    ],
    "post_example_writeup": "「に限って」 can be quite versatile due to its ability to convey both strong trust and cynical observation, as well as ironic timing. It often adds a layer of emotional weight, whether it be surprise, frustration, or certainty, to the statement.

            "nuance": "「だけ」 is a simple limiter indicating exclusivity without the nuance of surprise, irony, or disbelief that 「に限って」 carries. It's a neutral statement of limitation, whereas 「に限って」 often implies an unexpected or undesirable exception. For example, 「コーヒーだけ飲む」 (I only drink coffee) is a neutral statement, but 「急いでいる時に限って雨が降る」 (It only rains when I'm in a hurry) implies an ironic misfortune that 「急いでいる時だけ雨が降る」 might not fully capture, though it is sometimes used interchangeably in casual speech, thereby causing confusion with the uninitiated learner."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「だけ」 simply indicates exclusivity, 「に限って」 adds a layer of irony, surprise, or disbelief to the situation. It suggests that something happens *particularly* or *ironically* only in a specific instance, often contrary to expectation or desire. For example, while 「雨が降っている時だけ傘をさす」 (I only use an umbrella when it's raining) is a neutral statement, 「大事な日に限って雨が降る」 (It rains *only* on important days, ironically) expresses frustration or bad luck. Therefore, when you want to convey that something is an unfortunate exception or an ironic coincidence, 「に限って」 is the more appropriate choice.",
