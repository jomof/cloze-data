    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に足りない」 comes from the particle 「に」 and the verb 「足りる」 (tariru), which means \"to be sufficient\" or \"to be enough.\" By negating 「足りる」, we get 「足りない」 (tarinai), meaning \"not sufficient\" or \"not enough.\" The addition of 「に」 before 「足りない」 creates a structure that expresses the idea of something not being worthy or sufficient for a particular purpose or action. Historically, 「足る」 (taru) is an older variant of 「足りる」, and its negation 「足らない」 (taranai) still exists, particularly in western Japan or more literary contexts, though 「足りない」 is the more common modern standard form. The evolution from 「足る」 to 「足りる」 reflects a broader linguistic shift in verb conjugations, while the 「に」 particle retains its function of indicating the object or basis for the judgment of sufficiency/worth.",
    "writeup": "「に足りない」 is a grammar expression used to indicate that something is \"not worthy of\" or \"not sufficient for\" a particular action or state. It typically follows the dictionary form of a verb, signifying that the action expressed by the verb is not justified or met by the subject.\n\nThis construction is highly formal and is predominantly encountered in written Japanese, such as academic papers, official documents, or literary works. While it can be used in formal speech, its usage is less common in everyday conversation due to its elevated register.\n\nThe core meaning revolves around an objective assessment of inherent inadequacy or lack of merit. It is not merely about a subjective inability or disinclination, but rather a judgment that something truly fails to meet the necessary standard or lacks the fundamental qualities to be considered worthy.\n\n**Comparison with similar expressions:**\n\nWhile 「に足りない」 is the negative form of 「に足る」, their relationship is not merely oppositional. 「に足る」 (ni taru) means \"to be worthy of\" or \"to be sufficient for.\" The verb 「足る」 (taru) itself is an older form of 「足りる」 (tariru), meaning \"to be enough\" or \"to be sufficient.\" Consequently, 「に足る」 is often found in more classical or literary contexts.\n\nBoth 「足りない」 and 「足らない」 (the negative form of 「足る」) can appear in the set phrase 「取るに足りない」 (toru ni tarinai), meaning \"worthless\" or \"insignificant.\" This idiom specifically emphasizes that something is so trivial it's not even worth discussing or picking up.",
