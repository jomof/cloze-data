    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に足りない」 comes from the particle 「に」and the verb 「足りる」 (tariru), which means \"to be sufficient\" or \"to be enough.\" By negating 「足りる」, we get 「足りない」 (tarinai), meaning \"not sufficient\" or \"not enough.\" The addition of 「に」 before 「足りない」 creates a structure that expresses the idea of something not being worthy or sufficient for a particular purpose or action.",
    "writeup": "「に足りない」 is a grammar expression that follows the dictionary form of a verb. It indicates that something is \"not worth (A)\" or \"not sufficient for (A).\" It is derived from the particle 「に」 and the verb 「足りる」 (tariru), which means \"to be sufficient\" or \"to be enough.\"\n\nThis structure is formal and is often used in literature or formal speech settings. While 「に足りない」 may seem similar to 「に足る」 (ni tariru), they are actually different verbs with opposite meanings. 「に足る」 means \"to be worth (A)\" or \"to be sufficient for (A).\" 「足る」 is an う-verb and is often used more in literature or in western Japan. Its negative form is 「足らない」 (taranai), not 「足りない」.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\n\nBoth 「足りない」 and 「足らない」 may be used in the set phrase 「取るに足りない」 (toru ni tarinai), which means \"worthless\" or \"not worth taking up for discussion.\"",
