  '[Subject は] + [Object が] + 要る/要ります': Indicates that the subject needs the object.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The verb 「要る」 originally meant "to take" or "to require." Over time, its meaning evolved to
  specifically indicate the necessity of something. It shares a root with the noun 「要 (かなめ)」, meaning
  "essential point" or "key," further highlighting the concept of necessity.
writeup: |-
  The verb 「要る・いる」 means "to need" or "to require" something. It is a **Godan verb** (Group 1), crucial for expressing what is necessary or required. The particle が is used to mark the object that is needed, while は often marks the subject or the person needing something.

  Remember to conjugate 「要る」 according to the politeness level and tense required by the context. For example, the polite form 「要ります」 is commonly used in formal situations, while 「要る」 is used in casual settings.

  While grammatically possible, some conjugations such as the imperative (e.g., 「要れ」, 「要りなさい」), potential (「要れる」), passive (「要られる」), and causative (「要らせる」) forms are **very rare** or **unnatural** in everyday usage for the meaning of "to need." This is because "to need" is typically a state or a passive requirement, not an action that can be commanded, made possible, or caused in the same way as other verbs.

  - term: 必要 (ひつよう)
    meaning: necessary
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「要る」 is a verb meaning "to need," 「必要」 is a na-adjective meaning "necessary." 「必要」 often
      describes a state or condition, while 「要る」 describes a verb of requiring. For example, you'd say
      「ビタミンが必要です」 (vitamins are necessary) or 「ビタミンが要ります」 (I need vitamins).
    grammar_point: な-Adjectives (adjectival nouns)
  - term: 居る (いる)
    meaning: to exist, to be (living things)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「居る」 (いる) shares the same pronunciation as 「要る」, but refers specifically to the existence
      of animate objects (living beings). 「要る」, in contrast, means 'to need' and applies to both animate
      and inanimate things. Their similar sound but different meanings and kanji are a common source of
      confusion.
    grammar_point: いる (to exist, animate)
  - term: 在る (ある)
    meaning: to exist, to be (non-living things)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「在る」 (ある) denotes the existence of inanimate objects. While 「要る」 means 'to need,' 「在る」 simply
      indicates presence. Although their kanji and pronunciation are distinct from 「要る」, understanding
      the fundamental difference between 'to need' and 'to exist' is crucial.
    grammar_point: ある (to exist, inanimate・to have)
  - term: 必要とする
    meaning: to consider necessary, to require (as a verb)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「必要とする」 implies a more deliberate act of determining or recognizing a need, or a more objective/formal
      requirement, whereas 「要る」 is a simpler, more direct statement of need. 「要る」 is more common for personal
      or immediate needs.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:必要とする (to consider necessary, to require)
  - term: 求める
    meaning: to seek, to ask for, to demand, to wish for
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「求める」 implies an active effort to acquire something, or to request or demand it. In contrast,
      「要る」 simply states that something is needed or required, without necessarily implying an an active
      search or request. 「要る」 is a state of needing, while 「求める」 is an action of pursuing.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:求める (to seek, to ask for, to demand, to wish for)
post_false_friends_writeup: The distinction between 「要る」 and 「必要」 lies primarily in their grammatical
  function. 「要る」 is a verb, focusing on the act of needing, while 「必要」 functions as a na-adjective, describing
  the state of being necessary. Choose 「要る」 when expressing that something is required or needed, and
  「必要」 when describing something as being in a necessary state. The structure used with them is also different;
  「要る」 is used with がを mark what is needed, while 「必要」 often uses がと 「ある」 or 「です」. The verb 「必要とする」 is
  a more formal and objective way to express need, often implying a recognition of a requirement, distinct
  from the direct personal need expressed by 「要る」. 「求める」, on the other hand, implies an active pursuit
  or request for something, unlike 「要る」 which describes a state of necessity.

      - 新しい 靴、{要る} なぁ。
    english_literally: To me, new shoes are needed.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 に は 新しい 靴 が {必要 です}。
        english: New shoes are necessary for me.
        hint: 「必要です」 describes something as being necessary in a more objective or general sense. We're
          looking for the speaker's personal, direct feeling of needing something.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新しい 靴 が {ある}。
        english: There are new shoes.
        hint: 「ある」 indicates existence or presence. We're looking for the sense of needing something,
          not just its existence.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 新しい 靴 を {必要 と する}。
        english: I deem new shoes necessary.
        hint: 「必要とする」 implies a more formal or deliberate recognition of a need. We're looking for a simple,
          direct statement of personal need.
    scene: A young woman looking at her worn-out shoes and deciding to buy new ones.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The use of 「私には」 emphasizes the personal nature of the need. The casual register and reflective
      setting make 「要る」 a natural choice for expressing a personal, immediate requirement. Using 「要るの」
      or 「要るなぁ」 adds a more personal and reflective nuance suitable for thinking aloud.
  - english: This room needs a new desk.
    japanese:
      - この 部屋 に は 新しい 机 が {要り ます}。
      - この 部屋 に は 新しい 机 が {要り ます} ね。

          - この 部屋 に は 新しい 机 が {必要 です}。
        english: A new desk is necessary for this room.

          - この 部屋 に は 新しい 机 が {あり ます}。
        english: There is a new desk in this room.

          not its current presence.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 部屋 は 新しい 机 を {必要 と し ます}。
        english: This room requires a new desk.
        hint: 「必要とします」 is a more formal or objective way to express a requirement, often used for rules
          or systems. Here, we're expressing a practical need for the room itself.
    scene: A manager discussing office supplies.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The formal register and setting make 「要ります」 appropriate. The speaker's use of this verb implies
      a direct, functional requirement for the room, rather than a general or objective necessity that
      「必要です」 might suggest. The use of 「ね」 (optional addition) would soften the statement, seeking agreement.
  - english: We don't need an umbrella today, do we?
    japanese:
      - 今日 は 傘 が {要ら ない} ね。
      - 今日 は 傘 {要ら ない} よ ね。

        english: Today, an umbrella is not necessary, right?

          - 今日 は 傘 が {ない} ね。
        english: Today, there is no umbrella, right?

          - 今日 は 傘 を {必要 と し ない} ね。
        english: Today, we do not require an umbrella, right?

    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The casual register and the sentence-final particle 「ね」 suggest a light, conversational tone,
      seeking agreement. The male speaker might use 「よな」 for a slightly more emphatic, self-confirming
      nuance. 「要らない」 directly expresses a lack of personal requirement for the umbrella.
  - english: At that time, no one needed my help.
    japanese:
      - あの 時 は 誰 も 私 の 助け が {要ら なかっ た}。

        english: At that time, no one's help was necessary.
        hint: 「必要ではなかった」 is a neutral statement of past non-necessity. 「要らなかった」 often carries a nuance
          of the help not being desired or utilized, fitting a reflective or slightly melancholic tone.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 時 は 誰 も 私 の 助け が {なかっ た}。
        english: At that time, no one had my help.
        hint: 「なかった」 simply states absence. 「要らなかった」 specifically means that the help was not required
          or wanted by anyone.

          - あの 時 は 誰 も 私 の 助け を {必要 と し なかっ た}。
        english: At that time, no one deemed my help necessary.

    scene: A woman reflecting on a past event where her offer of help was not accepted.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The use of 「要らなかった」 in a melancholic setting emphasizes the speaker's feeling that her help
      was not utilized or desired. The optional 「なんか」 (roughly 'something like') can add a slight dismissive
      or self-deprecating tone, and 「のよね」 (if added) makes it feel more like a personal reflection or
      gentle lament, common for female speakers.
  - english: If you need help, please tell me.
    japanese:
      - もし 助け が {要っ たら}、言っ て ください ね。

        english: If help was necessary, please tell me.

        english: If you seek help, please tell me.

          needed, without implying an active search or request.
    scene: An older colleague offering support to a younger one who is working on a difficult task.
    register: formal
    setting: supportive
    conjugation: conditional (～たら)
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The polite request 「～てくださいね」 softens the tone, making the conditional phrase a genuine offer
      of help. The older speaker's advice to a younger colleague makes the supportive setting natural.
      The use of 「もし」 at the beginning reinforces the conditional nature.
    etymology: The use of 「もし」 (if) at the beginning of the sentence is a common way to introduce a conditional
      clause in Japanese, stemming from classical Japanese where it functioned similarly to an adverbial
      particle indicating supposition.
  - english: This dish needs salt to be tastier.

          inclusion of salt to make it more delicious, highlighting its role in the process.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 料理 は 塩 を {必要 と し て}、もっと 美味しい。
        english: This dish requires salt to be tastier.
        hint: 「必要として」 is a more formal or objective way of stating a requirement. 「要って」 is a more casual
          and direct expression of needing salt for the dish to improve.
    scene: Someone advising a friend on how to improve a dish.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The casual register and friendly setting make the direct use of 「要って」 natural when offering
      advice on cooking. The te-form connects the need for salt to the outcome of becoming tastier. The
      male speaker might use 「～なるよ」 for a more assertive but still friendly tone.

          - 昨日 の パーティー は ワイン を たくさん {必要 と し まし た}。
        english: Yesterday's party required a lot of wine.

    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: female

    nuance: The polite past tense 「要りました」 is used in a casual storytelling context, suitable for recounting
      events to a group. The female speaker might add 「よ」 at the end for emphasis, making the statement
      more assertive while remaining polite. This choice implies a direct, practical need for the wine,
      rather than a mere objective necessity.

          - 他 に 何 か {必要 です か}？
        english: Is anything else necessary?
        hint: 「必要ですか」 is a more objective inquiry about necessity. 「要りますか」 is a more direct, service-oriented
          question about what the person individually requires or wants.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 他 に 何 か {あり ます か}？
        english: Is there anything else?
        hint: 「ありますか」 asks about the existence or presence of something. 「要りますか」 specifically asks if
          something is needed or desired.

          statement that *you* won't need to bring anything, often implying it's already provided or unnecessary.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 何 も {持っ て 来 なく て も いい} です よ。
        english: You don't have to bring anything.

    register: semi-formal
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)

        english: Even if you don't have it now, it might be useful later. Sensitive to Japanese nuances,
          「なくても」 means 'even if there isn't' or 'even if you don't have.' 「要らなくても」 specifically means
          'even if you don't *need* it'.
        hint: 「なくても」 means 'even if there isn't' or 'even if you don't have.' 「要らなくても」 specifically means

    nuance: The use of the negative concessive 「要らなくても」 highlights the parent's understanding that the
      child doesn't see an immediate need, but still offers a pragmatic perspective. The male, older speaker's
      advice uses 「だよ」 or 「かもね」 for a gentle but firm tone, common in parental guidance.

    nuance: In a professional setting, 「要ります」 conveys a direct, tangible need for resources or input.

      effectively. It's a statement of practical necessity.

      - 北海道 旅行 に は 夏 で も 暖かい 服 が {要る} と の こと です。

          need or requirement for the traveler based on what was heard.
    scene: Friends discussing their travel plans.
    register: casual

    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The combination with 「そうです」 (hearsay) or 「とのことです」 (report) indicates that the speaker is relaying
      information they've gathered about the practical requirements for the trip. 「要る」 here refers to
      the tangible items one would practically need to bring.
post_example_writeup: As a verb expressing a state of needing, some conjugations of 「要る」 are grammatically
  possible but pragmatically rare or sound unnatural. These include direct commands like the imperative
  forms (e.g., 「要れ」, 「要りなさい」), the potential form (「要れる」, meaning 'can need'), the passive form (「要られる」,
  meaning 'to be needed by'), and the causative form (「要らせる」, meaning 'to make someone need'). In most
  cases where these forms might seem applicable, alternative expressions, often involving 「必要 (ひつよう)」
  or other verbs, are far more natural and commonly used. For example, instead of 「要られる」, one would typically
  say 「必要とされる」 (to be deemed necessary).
