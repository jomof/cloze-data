    "writeup": "The verb 「要る・いる」 means \"to need\" or \"to require\" something. It is a **Group 1** or **irregular-u verb**, crucial for expressing what is necessary or required. The particle が is used to mark the object that is needed, while は often marks the subject or the person needing something.\n\nRemember to conjugate 「要る」according to the politeness level and tense required by the context.
