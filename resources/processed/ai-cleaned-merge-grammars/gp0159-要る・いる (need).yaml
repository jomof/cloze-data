    "etymology": "The verb 「要る」originally meant \"to take\" or \"to require.\" Over time, its meaning evolved to specifically indicate the necessity of something. It shares a root with the noun 「要 (かなめ)」, meaning \"essential point\" or \"key,\" further highlighting the concept of necessity.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「要る・いる」 means \"to need\" or \"to require\" something. It is a **Group 1** or **irregular-u verb**, crucial for expressing what is necessary or required. The particle が is used to mark the object that is needed, while は often marks the subject or the person needing something.\n\nRemember to conjugate 「要る」according to the politeness level and tense required by the context. The polite form 「要ります」is commonly used in formal situations.",
