    "etymology": "The verb 「要る」 originally meant \"to take\" or \"to require.\" Over time, its meaning evolved to specifically indicate the necessity of something. It shares a root with the noun 「要 (かなめ)」, meaning \"essential point\" or \"key,\" further highlighting the concept of necessity.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「要る・いる」 means \"to need\" or \"to require\" something. It is a **Godan verb** (Group 1), crucial for expressing what is necessary or required. The particle が is used to mark the object that is needed, while は often marks the subject or the person needing something.\n\nRemember to conjugate 「要る」 according to the politeness level and tense required by the context. For example, the polite form 「要ります」 is commonly used in formal situations, while 「要る」 is used in casual settings.\n\nWhile grammatically possible, some conjugations such as the imperative (e.g., 「要れ」, 「要りなさい」), potential (「要れる」), passive (「要られる」), and causative (「要らせる」) forms are **very rare** or **unnatural** in everyday usage for the meaning of \"to need.\" This is because \"to need\" is typically a state or a passive requirement, not an action that can be commanded, made possible, or caused in the same way as other verbs.",
