formation:
  Noun + が + 欲しい: Indicates a desire for something (a thing).
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: general
etymology: The grammar point 「がほしい」 is derived from the i-adjective 「欲しい」 (hoshii), which means "wanted"
  or "desired." The 「が」 particle marks the object of desire. This construction exemplifies how Japanese
  adjectives directly convey states of being or desire, with the particle 「が」 indicating the subject or
  object of that state.
writeup: The 「がほしい」 grammar point is used to express a desire for a **thing** (noun). 「欲しい」 (hoshii) is
  an i-adjective, and therefore it conjugates just like any other i-adjective. It is crucial to understand
  that this construction is exclusively for expressing a desire for objects or concepts (nouns). When
  you wish to express a desire to *perform an action* (a verb), you must use the 「〜たい」 form. For example,
  to say "I want to eat," you would use 「食べたい」 (tabetai), not 「ご飯が欲しい」 (gohan ga hoshii), which would
  mean "I want rice" (the noun). Furthermore, 「がほしい」 primarily expresses the speaker's own desires. To
  discuss someone else's desires, especially if you are observing their inclination or appearance of wanting
  something, you would typically use the 「〜がる」 or 「〜たがる」 forms. For instance, 「彼 は 新しい 車 を 欲し がっ て いる」
  (Kare wa atarashii kuruma o hoshigatte iru) means "He seems to want a new car." An important related
  construction is 「〜てほしい」. While 「がほしい」 is about wanting a noun, 「〜てほしい」 is used when you want *another
  person to perform an action* for you. For example, 「手伝っ て ほしい」 (Tetsudatte hoshii) means "I want you
  to help me." This is distinct from wanting the *thing* "help" itself.

    meaning: Want to do

  - term: がる
    meaning: To show signs of wanting, to want (but for someone else)

      desire or inclination, often based on observation.
    grammar_point: がる (to show signs)
  - term: たがる
    meaning: To want to (Third person)

  - term: てほしい
    meaning: I want you to

  - term: ように〜てほしい
    meaning: Want ~ to ~ like ~, Want ~ to be able to ~, Want ~ to ~ in the way of ~
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This expression, similar to 「〜てほしい」, conveys a desire for someone to do something, but specifically
      emphasizes the *manner* or *way* in which the action should be done, or for a state to be achieved.
    grammar_point: ように〜てほしい (want someone to act in a certain way)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「がほしい」 is for desiring *things*, 「〜たい」 is
  for wanting to *do* something, and 「〜がる」 is for describing *someone else's* desires based on observation.
  「〜てほしい」 and 「〜ように〜てほしい」 are used for wanting someone else to *perform an action*, with the latter emphasizing
  the manner or state.

      family photos.
    register: casual

    speaker_age: younger

      particle, adding a touch of personal sentiment.

      as public speaking anxiety.

    setting: reflective
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: Here, 「欲しい」 is used to express a desire for an intangible quality, 「勇気」 (yuuki - courage),
      which is treated as a noun. This shows the versatility of 「が欲しい」 beyond concrete objects.

        hint: '`〜がほしい` asks about a desired *thing* (a gift). `〜たい` asks about a desired *action* (what
          you want to do).'
    scene: A mother asks her child what gift they would like for their upcoming birthday.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: interrogative
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: This is a very common and natural way to inquire about someone's desired gift. The polite
      「です か」 makes it suitable for addressing a child or someone younger while maintaining a polite tone.
      The question is open-ended, allowing for any noun as an answer.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, 「がほしい」 is quite flexible. It can be used for
  both tangible objects like a computer and intangible concepts like courage. While it primarily expresses
  the speaker's desire, it can also appear in quoted speech or questions about others' desires, though
  direct statements of another's desire would typically use the 「〜がる」 form. Pay close attention to whether
  the desired item is a noun or an action, as this dictates whether to use 「がほしい」 or 「〜たい」.
