etymology: The word 「なお」originally meant "in addition to" or "furthermore." Over time, it also came to
  express the idea of something continuing or remaining in a certain state, even after other factors have
  come into play. The 「今もなお」construction emphasizes the persistence of something up to the present moment.
writeup: |-
  The adverb 「なお」is primarily used to convey the sense of "still," "even," or "yet." It emphasizes the continuation of a state or action, often highlighting that this continuation is surprising or noteworthy given previous circumstances. While it can be written with the kanji 尚, it is most commonly encountered in kana, especially in its adverbial usage.

  When 「なお」follows a clause ending in 「も」 (e.g., 「〜てもなお」), it strongly emphasizes that despite the condition or situation described in the first clause, the state or action in the second clause persists. This often implies that the persistence is unexpected or particularly significant.

  「今もなお」is a very common set phrase, meaning "even now" or "still at present." It's frequently used to underline a lasting condition or fact. Furthermore, 「なお」can also indicate an increased degree or quantity, translating to "even more," "still more," or "yet another." This nuance implies that something has progressed to an even greater extent or that an additional amount is involved.

  Overall, 「なお」is considered a formal grammatical structure, lending a more refined or literary tone to sentences. It is distinct from its homophone 「なお②」, which functions as a conjunction meaning "in addition," "incidentally," or "furthermore," introducing supplementary information rather than emphasizing continuation.
false_friends:
  - term: なお (additionally)
    meaning: In addition, incidentally, furthermore, moreover
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This 「なお」 functions as a conjunction introducing additional information, rather than emphasizing
      a continuing state or an increased degree. It often appears at the beginning of a sentence.
    grammar_point: なお (supplementary information)
  - term: まだ
    meaning: Still, yet
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「まだ」 also means 'still' or 'yet', indicating continuation. However, 「なお」 (especially with
      「今も」) implies a more surprising, noteworthy, or formal continuation, often against expectations,
      whereas 「まだ」 is a more general and less emphasized continuation.
    grammar_point: まだ (still・not yet)
  - term: 一層
    meaning: Even more, much more, all the more
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「一層」 is a synonym for 'even more' or 'much more', similar to the intensifying nuance of 「なお」.
      While often interchangeable, 「なお」 can sometimes carry a subtler sense of something developing to
      an even greater extent due to certain conditions.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:一層 (even more・much more)
  - term: 以前として
    meaning: As before, as ever, still
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「以前として」 conveys that a situation remains unchanged or continues as it was previously. It is
      similar to 「なお」 in meaning 'still', but 「以前として」 often emphasizes the *unchanged* nature of the state,
      whereas 「なお」 can also highlight the *ongoing* nature or a surprising persistence.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:以前として (as before・as ever)
  - term: 更に
    meaning: Furthermore, additionally, even more
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「更に」 can mean 'furthermore' (similar to なお②) or 'even more' (similar to なお (still)'s intensifying
      nuance). When used for intensification, 「なお」 often implies a stronger, more unexpected degree, while
      「更に」 can be a more straightforward additive increase.
    grammar_point: 更に (even more)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate 「なお」 from similar expressions, consider the specific nuance.
  If the emphasis is on something persisting in a surprising or noteworthy way despite other factors,
  or if it conveys an enhanced degree (even more so), then 「なお (still)」 is likely the appropriate choice.
  If the goal is simply to add more information, the conjunctive 「なお②」 is used. For simple continuation
  without specific emphasis or formality, 「まだ」 is generally sufficient. Expressions like 「一層」 and 「更に」
  are often interchangeable with the 'even more' sense of 「なお」, but 「なお」 can sometimes imply a more profound
  or unexpected increase in degree.

        hint: This implies a surprising and noteworthy continuation despite the circumstances. 「以前として」
          emphasizes that the situation remains unchanged from a previous state, which isn't quite the
          nuance here.
