    "writeup": "**せっかく** expresses the idea of something done with effort, or a valuable opportunity that arises. It often carries a nuance of regret if the effort is wasted or the opportunity is missed. It can also be used to accept offers politely.\n\n*   **せっかく + Verb**: Indicates that something was done with effort or that a valuable opportunity is present.\n*   **せっかくの + Noun**: Highlights the value or preciousness of the noun. For example, 「せっかくの週末」 (a precious weekend).\n\nIt commonly appears with **のに** to express disappointment (e.g., \"Although I went to the trouble...\") or **のだから** to state a reason based on the effort made (e.g., \"Because I studied so hard...\").\n\n**せっかくですが** is a common phrase used to politely decline an offer, while **せっかくですから** is used to accept an offer politely.",
    "etymology": "The etymology of せっかく is debated, but it's thought to be related to 精 (sei), meaning \"effort\" or \"spirit,\" and 各 (kaku), possibly implying \"each\" or \"every.\" Combined, these suggest the idea of putting in effort in every aspect or making the most of each opportunity. The term has evolved to convey both the effort involved and the potential regret if that effort is not rewarded or if an opportunity is missed. The kanji for 精 and 各 are not typically used to write せっかく, which is usually written in hiragana.",
