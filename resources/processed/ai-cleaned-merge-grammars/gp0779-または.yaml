    "writeup": "「または」 is a conjunction used to connect two nouns or two sentences, presenting them as alternatives or possibilities. It is similar to 「か」, but 「または」 is generally considered more formal and is often used in written language or formal speech. It is equivalent to \"or\" or \"either... or...\" in English.\n\nIt's important to note that 「または」 is more common in formal contexts, such as legal documents, academic papers, or business correspondence. In casual conversation, 「か」 is more frequently used.",
