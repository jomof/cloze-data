    "writeup": "「または」 is a conjunction used to connect two nouns or two sentences, presenting them as alternatives or possibilities. It is similar to 「か」, but 「または」 is generally considered more formal and is often used in written language or formal speech.

In casual conversation, 「か」 is more frequently used.",
