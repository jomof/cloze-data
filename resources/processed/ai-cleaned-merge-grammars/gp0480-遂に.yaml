        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "general usage",
        "function": "Indicates the culmination or realization of an event or state after a long process, effort, or anticipation.",
        "nuance": "「遂に」 carries a strong nuance of accomplishment or finality after a period of significant duration, effort, or struggle. It implies that the outcome was long-awaited or hard-won, often evoking a sense of relief, triumph, or inevitability based on prior actions.",
        "grammatical-role": "Adverbial modifier, typically modifying the main verb of the sentence or the entire proposition.",
        "temporal-flow": "Emphasizes the endpoint of a long-term progression, indicating that a significant event has finally occurred."
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「遂に」 (ついに) originates from the classical Japanese verb 「遂げる」(とげる), meaning \"to accomplish,\" \"to carry out,\" or \"to achieve.\" This linguistic root directly informs its modern usage, emphasizing the culmination of a long process, the successful completion of a task, or the arrival at a long-awaited outcome after considerable effort or passage of time. The kanji 「遂」 inherently conveys this sense of successful achievement or completion, distinguishing it from other adverbs of completion.",
    "writeup": "「遂に」(ついに) is an adverb used to express that something has **finally** or **at last** occurred. It carries a strong nuance of an outcome achieved after a significant period of time, considerable effort, or long anticipation. The kanji 「遂」 (sui), meaning \"to accomplish\" or \"to complete,\" reinforces this emphasis on culmination and achievement.\n\nThis adverb is typically used when discussing events that required a notable passage of time, persistent effort, or overcoming obstacles. For example, it would be appropriate for a long-awaited project reaching completion, a difficult goal finally being achieved, or a long-term situation finally resolving. It is **not** used for trivial, immediate occurrences that do not involve such a process.\n\nWhile 「遂に」 often appears at the beginning of a sentence for emphasis, its position can vary. Compared to the similar adverb 「とうとう」(tōtō), 「遂に」 is generally considered slightly more formal and places a greater emphasis on the effort or struggle involved in reaching the final outcome, rather than just the inevitability of it. For instance, 「遂に」 might be used to describe the success of a scientist after years of research, while 「とうとう」 might describe the inevitable collapse of an old building.",

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "While similar, 「とうとう」 often suggests an outcome that was inevitable or the natural conclusion of a process, sometimes carrying a sense of resignation or finality. 「遂に」, on the other hand, strongly emphasizes the successful completion of a long-term goal or the achievement of something after considerable effort, struggle, or anticipation."

            "nuance": "「いよいよ」 conveys a sense of anticipation or excitement about something that is about to begin or is already starting. It focuses on the imminence of an event, contrasting with 「遂に」 which highlights the successful culmination or realization of something that has already occurred or reached its conclusion."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When choosing between 「遂に」, 「とうとう」, and 「いよいよ」, consider the precise nuance you wish to convey. Use 「遂に」 to emphasize the accomplishment of a long-term goal or the resolution of a long process after significant effort or anticipation. Opt for 「とうとう」 when describing an outcome that feels inevitable or has finally happened after a natural progression, sometimes with a touch of resignation. Choose 「いよいよ」 when conveying a sense of excitement or heightened anticipation for an event that is just about to begin.",
