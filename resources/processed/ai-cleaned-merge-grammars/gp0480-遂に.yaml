    "etymology": "The word 「遂に」 comes from the verb 「遂げる」(to accomplish, to carry out). It implies the sense of completing something after a long process or overcoming obstacles. The kanji 「遂」 itself carries the meaning of accomplishment or completion.",
    "writeup": "「遂に」(tsuini) is an adverb that means \"finally\" or \"at last.\" It's often used at the beginning of a sentence to emphasize that something has happened after a considerable period of time, effort, or anticipation. It is slightly more formal than 「とうとう」. Be careful not to use 「遂に」 for situations that don't require a significant amount of time or effort.",
