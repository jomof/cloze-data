    "etymology": "The word 「遂に」 comes from the verb 「遂げる」(to accomplish, to carry out). It implies the sense of completing something after a long process or overcoming obstacles. The kanji 「遂」 itself carries the meaning of accomplishment or completion.",
    "writeup": "「遂に」(ついに) is an adverb meaning \"finally\" or \"at last.\" It is typically used to express that something has come to pass after a significant period of time, effort, or anticipation. The kanji 「遂」 carries the meaning of accomplishment or completion, which informs its nuance; 「遂に」 emphasizes the culmination of a long process or overcoming obstacles. While it is often placed at the beginning of a sentence, its position can vary. Compared to 「とうとう」, 「遂に」 is generally considered slightly more formal. It is important to note that 「遂に」 is reserved for events that require time, effort, or a considerable course of events to reach their conclusion; it is not used for simple, immediate occurrences.",
