    "etymology": "「遂に」 is derived from the verb 「遂げる」(とげる), meaning \"to accomplish, to carry out, to fulfill\". The adverbial form 「遂に」 retains the nuance of achieving something after a process.",
    "writeup": "「遂に」(tsuini) is an adverb that means \"finally\" or \"at last.\" It's similar to 「とうとう」 but slightly more formal. It often appears at the beginning of a sentence, emphasizing that something has happened after a significant period, effort, or a long series of events.  It suggests a culmination or resolution. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「遂に」 is often written in kanji, but it can also be written in hiragana.\n*   It's **not** used for things that happen quickly or without effort.",
