  part-of-speech: verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to express that something is sufficient, completed, or can be managed with minimal
    effort, cost, or resources.
  function: Indicates sufficiency, completion, or resolution.
  nuance: Often carries a sense of relief or satisfaction that a situation could be resolved easily or
    with minimal consequences. It highlights efficiency or the avoidance of unnecessary burden.
  grammatical-role: intransitive verb
  logical-flow: sufficiency or resolution
etymology: The verb 「済む (すむ)」 originally meant "to finish" or "to complete." Over time, its meaning expanded
  to include the idea of something being sufficient or enough to resolve a situation. It shares a root
  with 「済ませる (すませる)」, which means "to finish" or "to settle (transitive)."
writeup: |-
  「済む (すむ)」 is a versatile intransitive verb that conveys the idea of something being **sufficient**, **enough**, or **completed** with minimal effort or resources. It expresses that a situation can be resolved, a task can be accomplished, or a need can be met without requiring extensive measures. This often implies a sense of relief or efficiency in achieving a satisfactory outcome.

  It can be used in various contexts:

  *   **Cost or Time**: To indicate something costs or takes only a certain amount of money or time.
  *   **Requirements**: To show that something is enough or can be managed with minimal requirements or conditions.
  *   **Avoidance**: To express that one can avoid doing something or that something is not necessary, leading to a simpler resolution.

  **Important Considerations**

  *   「済む」 inherently implies that a particular condition or action is adequate to bring about a desired outcome, often simplifying a potentially complex situation.
  *   While it has a general meaning of 'to finish' or 'to be over', its nuance in this grammatical context emphasizes 'being sufficient' or 'getting by' with less than might be expected.
false_friends:
  - term: 足りる
    meaning: to be sufficient; to be enough
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「済む」, 「足りる」 emphasizes that there is enough of something in terms of quantity or capacity,
      rather than a situation being resolved or completed with minimal effort or a specific condition
      being met.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:足りる (to be sufficient; to be enough)
  - term: 間に合う
    meaning: to be on time; to suffice
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「間に合う」 refers to being in time for something or something being sufficient for a particular
      purpose or deadline. While it implies adequacy, it differs from the broader sense of resolution
      or completion conveyed by 「済む」, which focuses more on getting by or doing with minimal fuss.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:間に合う (to be on time; to suffice)
  - term: 済ませる
    meaning: to finish; to complete (transitive)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「済ませる」 is the transitive counterpart of 「済む」, implying an active completion or finishing of
      something, often with a sense of getting it done quickly or simply. Unlike 「済む」, which describes
      a state of being sufficient or completed, 「済ませる」 implies agency in making something sufficient or
      completed. For example, 宿題を済ませる (to finish homework) vs 宿題が済む (homework is finished/done).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:済ませる (to finish・to complete transitive)
  - term: 終わる
    meaning: to finish; to end
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「終わる」 is a general verb for 'to end' or 'to finish', without the specific nuance of 'being
      sufficient' or 'getting by with minimal resources' that 「済む」 conveys.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:終わる (to finish)
  - term: なくてもいい
    meaning: no need to; it's okay not to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「なくてもいい」 directly expresses the lack of necessity, while 「済む」 implies that a situation is
      resolved *because* something is not needed or *can be managed without* it. 「済む」 carries a sense
      of efficient resolution.
    grammar_point: なくてもいい (no need to)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「足りる」 and 「間に合う」 can sometimes overlap in meaning with 「済む」, it's important
  to consider the specific context. 「足りる」 focuses on sufficiency in quantity, while 「間に合う」 emphasizes
  timeliness or suitability for a particular purpose. 「済む」, on the other hand, carries a broader sense
  of something being completed, resolved, or managed with minimal effort. The transitive verb 「済ませる」 emphasizes
  the action of bringing something to completion or making it sufficient, in contrast to 「済む」's intransitive
  nature of something simply being sufficient or finished on its own. 「終わる」 is a general verb for 'to
  end' or 'to finish', lacking the specific nuance of sufficiency or managing with minimal resources found
  in 「済む」. Lastly, 「なくてもいい」 explicitly states that something is not needed or is acceptable to omit, whereas
  「済む」 implies that a situation can be resolved or managed *because* something is not needed, focusing
  on the efficient outcome.

          to resolve a serious matter.'
    scene: A supervisor sternly telling an employee that their apology is insufficient for a serious mistake.

    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The speaker is an older male supervisor, using the polite negative 「済みません」 (or the plain 「済まない」
      for added sternness) and addressing a male employee. The use of 「よ」 adds a tone of assertion or
      warning. The phrase 「謝罪 だけ で は 済みません」 strongly implies that the apology is utterly insufficient
      to resolve the serious mistake, demanding further action.

        english: Since two people were enough, I was helped.
        hint: 'While 「足りる」 focuses on sufficiency in number, 「済む」 here emphasizes that the situation was
          *resolved* or *managed* with only two people, avoiding the need for more. We''re looking for
          an HINT: expression that highlights managing with minimal resources.'

      - competing_japanese:
          - これ を 早く {終わら せ ましょう}。
        english: Let's quickly finish this.
        hint: 'While 「終わらせる」 simply means to finish, 「済ませる」 implies completing something quickly or efficiently
          to get it out of the way. We''re looking for a HINT: verb that conveys ''getting something done
          and over with''.'
    scene: Friends at work encouraging each other to finish a task quickly so they can go home.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: volitional polite (～ましょう)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The male speaker uses the volitional form 「済ませよう」 or 「済まそう」 (in the variations) to encourage
      action. The choice of 「済ませる」 (the transitive counterpart of 済む) over 「終わらせる」 suggests not just finishing,
      but doing so efficiently and perhaps with a sense of relief that it's taken care of, allowing them
      to move on.
post_example_writeup: 「済む」 is a versatile verb that appears frequently in daily conversation. Pay attention
  to the context to grasp the precise nuance, as it can range from simple completion to the avoidance
  of a more serious situation. The key is understanding that something is deemed *sufficient* or *adequate*
  to handle the situation at hand.
