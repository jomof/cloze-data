    "etymology": "では is a contraction of で + は. で is the particle indicating location or means, and は is the topic marker. Therefore, the original nuance might have been something like \"in that case\" or \"regarding that matter.\" それでは further expands this by adding それ (that). じゃあ is a more casual contraction of では or それでは.",
    "writeup": "The expressions **では**, **それでは**, and **じゃあ** function as conjunctions in Japanese, signaling a transition in discourse, indicating a conclusion, or serving as a polite valediction. **それでは** represents the most formal iteration, followed by **では**, with **じゃあ** being the most casual. Fundamentally, they all convey similar notions such as 'if so,' 'well then,' or 'in that case.' Their utility extends beyond simple transitions; they often preface a logical consequence stemming from a preceding statement or mark a significant shift in conversational topic. Notably, these forms, particularly **では** and **それでは**, are also employed to politely conclude an an interaction, akin to the English 'well, I must be going now.' The underlying structure of **それでは** can be analyzed as a compound of それ (that), the particle で (indicating means or context), and the topic marker は, collectively creating a cohesive unit for initiating a new phase of communication or concluding a current one.",
