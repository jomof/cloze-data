Therefore, the original nuance might have been something like \"in that case\" or \"regarding that matter.\" それでは further expands this by adding それ (that). じゃあ is a more casual contraction of では or それでは.",
    "writeup": "**では**, **それでは**, and **じゃあ** are conjunctions used to transition topics, indicate a conclusion, or as a polite farewell. **それでは** is the most formal, **では** is slightly less formal, and **じゃあ** is the most casual.  All three can generally be translated as \"if so,\" \"well then,\" or \"in that case.\" They can also be used to politely end a conversation, similar to saying \"well, I should be going now\" in English.  Think of them as a way to smoothly move from one point to the next or to signal the end of a discussion. **それでは** is a combination of それ (that), で (the particle indicating location or means), and は (the topic marker).",
