    "etymology": "This grammar point is built upon the structure 「わけにはいかない」 (wake ni wa ikanai), meaning \"cannot afford to\" or \"no way to.\" The addition of 「ない」 before 「わけにはいかない」 creates a double negative, emphasizing the necessity or inevitability of the action. The literal sense is akin to \"there's no reason why (A) can't be done,\" conveying a strong sense of obligation or lack of alternatives.",
    "writeup": "「ないわけにはいかない」 is used to express that something **must** be done, that there's \"no way to avoid\" doing it. It builds upon the grammar pattern 「わけにはいかない」, which means \"can't afford to do.\" By negating the 「わけにはいかない」 part, it creates a double negative, emphasizing the necessity. Compared to similar structures like 「なければならない」 or 「ないといけない」, 「ないわけにはいかない」 often implies there are specific circumstances necessitating the action, frequently used to provide an excuse or justification.",
