        "usage-context": "Used by superiors/elders to subordinates/younger people, or in general a gentle, encouraging tone. Cannot be used for one's own actions.",
        "function": "To make a polite suggestion or a light command.",
        "nuance": "Implies a softer, more invitational tone compared to direct commands like なさい, often with an underlying meaning of 'try as you like, when it suits you'."
    },
    "etymology": "「ごらん (御覧)」is the polite imperative form of the verb 「見る (miru)」, meaning \"to see\" or \"to look.\" When attached to the -te form of another verb, it creates a polite suggestion or command to try doing something. The honorific prefix 「御 (go)」 combined with 「覧 (ran)」, derived from 「見る」, emphasizes the respectful nature of the suggestion.",
    "writeup": "「てごらん」 is a polite Japanese expression used to make a gentle suggestion or a light command, similar to 「なさい」 but often softer. It is frequently translated as \"please try to (A)\" or \"please look at (A)\", where (A) is the verb connected to 「ごらん」 using the 「て」 form. While often translated as \"please try\", the literal meaning of 「ごらん」 comes from \"to look\" or \"to peruse.\" This gives 「てごらん」 a nuance of \"try as you like, when it suits you,\" making it similar to 「てみる」 (\"to try\") but with an added invitational quality.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Since 「ごらん」 inherently carries an honorific and suggestive tone, it **cannot** be used to refer to your own actions. It is exclusively used to suggest actions to other people.\n*   Occasionally, 「ごらん」 and 「なさい」 are combined to form 「ごらんなさい」. This combination slightly strengthens the suggestion, giving it the feel of a very light command. Due to this increased directness, 「ごらんなさい」 is primarily used by superiors or elders when requesting something of a subordinate or younger person. It retains a polite tone but is more assertive than 「てごらん」 alone.",
