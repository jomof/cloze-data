    "etymology": "「ごらん (御覧)」is the polite imperative form of the verb 「見る (miru)」, meaning \"to see\" or \"to look\". When attached to the -te form of another verb, it creates a polite suggestion or command to try doing something.",
    "writeup": "「てごらん」 is a polite Japanese expression similar to 「なさい」. It's often translated as \"please try to (A)\", where (A) is the verb connected to 「ごらん」 with the 「て」 form. While translated as \"please try\", 「ごらん」 literally means \"to look\" or \"to peruse.\" Think of 「てごらん」 as similar to 「てみる」 (\"to try\"), but with the nuance of \"try as you like, when it suits you.\"\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Since 「ごらん」 is honorific, it cannot refer to your own actions. It's only used to suggest actions to others.\n*   Sometimes, 「ごらん」 and 「なさい」 are paired (「ごらんなさい」), which slightly strengthens the suggestion, potentially becoming a light command. Therefore, 「ごらんなさい」 is mainly used by superiors/elders when requesting a subordinate/younger person to try something.",
