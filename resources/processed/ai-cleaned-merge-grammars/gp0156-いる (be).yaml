    "etymology": "The verb 「いる」 originates from classical Japanese and has consistently served to express the existence or presence of animate beings. Historically, it contrasted with 「ある」, which denoted the existence of inanimate objects or locations. While 「ある」 could sometimes imply animate existence in older forms, 「いる」 specifically evolved to emphasize the living, moving presence of individuals and animals, solidifying this semantic distinction in modern Japanese.",
