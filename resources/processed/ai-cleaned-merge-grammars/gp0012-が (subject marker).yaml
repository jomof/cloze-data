meaning: Particle marking the grammatical subject of the sentence.
meaning_warning: が emphasizes what comes before it, while は emphasizes what comes after it
pronunciation:
  katakana: ガ
  romaji: ga
formation:
  Noun + が: Marks the subject of a sentence.
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: teineigo (polite)
  particle-syntactic-function: case-marking
  particle-pragmatic-function: emphasis
  usage-context: Generally used in various contexts, particularly when introducing new information or
    emphasizing the subject.
  function: Identifies the grammatical subject, often introducing new information or emphasizing it.
  nuance: Highlights the specific subject, contrasting it with other possibilities or presenting it as
    newly observed information.
etymology: The particle が is believed to have originated from the classical Japanese genitive particle
  'ga' (meaning "of"). Over time, it evolved to mark the subject in certain sentence structures, distinguishing
  it from the topic marker は.
writeup: が is the subject marker in Japanese. It identifies the performer of an action or something with
  a specific feature, especially when the listener is unaware. Unlike は, which highlights the topic, が
  emphasizes what precedes it. が focuses on the 'target' of a statement in relation to other possible
  targets, often used for situations happening 'in the moment' or independently. Be careful when describing
  yourself; は is usually more natural unless you're contrasting yourself with others.
false_friends:
  - term: は
    meaning: As for... (Highlights sentence topic)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike が, は marks the topic of the sentence, indicating already known information or establishing
      a general context.
    grammar_point: は (topic and contrast)
  - term: を
    meaning: Object marking particle
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike が, を marks the direct object of a transitive verb, indicating what is being acted upon,
      rather than the subject performing the action.
    grammar_point: を (object marker)
post_false_friends_writeup: は indicates the topic of a sentence, something already known or being discussed,
  while が introduces the subject or emphasizes it. を, on the other hand, marks the direct object of a
  verb, indicating what is being acted upon.
examples:
  - english: It's raining.
    japanese:
      - 雨 {が} 降っ て い ます。
      - 雨 {が} 降っ て いる。
      - 雨 {が} 降っ てる。
      - 雨 {が} 降っ て い ます ね。
      - 雨 {が} 降っ てる よ。
      - 雨 {が} 降っ てる ぜ。
      - 雨 {が} 降っ てる わ。
    english_literally: Rain, it is falling.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 雨 は 降っ て い ます。
        english: As for rain, it is falling.
        hint: The scene emphasizes the new observation of rain, not a general statement about rain. This
          grammar point is used to introduce new information that is specific to the current moment, differentiating
          it from a general topic statement with は. We're looking for an observation of new information.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 雨 を 降っ て い ます。
        english: Raining the rain.
        hint: The verb 「降る」 is intransitive, meaning it describes an action that doesn't take a direct
          object. This grammar point is used to mark the subject that is performing the action, not something
          being acted upon.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 雨 だ。
        english: It's rain.
        hint: This sentence identifies rain as the current state but does not describe the action of falling.
          We're looking for the subject of the verb 'to fall'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 雨降り だ。
        english: It's rainy.
        hint: This describes the weather as rainy, but it doesn't specify 'rain' as the subject of an
          ongoing action. We're looking for the subject of the action 'to fall'.
    scene: A person looks out the window and notices it has started raining.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: This sentence introduces the fact of rain as new information. The action is happening now,
      and the speaker is observing it. The use of が highlights the current, specific event. 「降って います」
      is the progressive form, indicating an ongoing action.
  - english: Is there a car?
    japanese:
      - 車 {が} あり ます か？
      - 車 {が} ある？
      - 車 {が} あり ます？
      - 車 {が} あん の？
      - 車 {が} ある の？
      - 車 {が} ござい ます か？
      - 車 {が} ある か い？
      - 車 {が} ある ん だろう か？
      - 車 {が} お あり です か？
    english_literally: Car, does it exist?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 車 は あり ます か？
        english: As for the car, is it there?
        hint: The verb 「ある」 (to exist) uses this grammar point to introduce the existence of something
          specific or new to the listener. The question focuses on the presence of a particular car, making
          it the natural choice. We're looking to inquire about the specific existence of something.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 車 を あり ます か？
        english: Is there the car?
        hint: The verb 「ある」 (to exist) is intransitive and does not take a direct object marked by 「を」.
          This grammar point correctly marks the subject that exists.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 車 の 有無 は どう です か？
        english: How about the existence of a car?
        hint: This is a more formal and indirect way to inquire about a car's presence. We're looking
          for a direct question about whether a car exists.
    scene: A man looking for his ride in a parking lot, asking his friend if they see the car.
    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「あります」 (to exist/there is) takes が to mark the subject. This is a question asking about the
      specific existence of a car, implying the listener might have new information about its presence.
  - english: There is water.
    japanese:
      - 水 {が} あり ます。
      - 水 {が} ある よ。
      - 水 {が} ある。
      - 水 {が} ござい ます。
      - 水 {が} あり ます よ。
      - 水 {が} ござい ます よ。
      - 水 {が} ある わ。
    english_literally: Water, exists.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 水 は あり ます。
        english: As for water, it exists.
        hint: The scene highlights the specific presence of water as newly relevant information. This
          grammar point is used to introduce the existence of something, making it appropriate for pointing
          out the water as a solution to thirst rather than making a general statement about water. We're
          looking to state the specific existence of something.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 水 を あり ます。
        english: There is the water.
        hint: Similar to 「車 が あります」, the verb 「ある」 (to exist) is intransitive. が is used to mark the subject
          that exists, not an object that is acted upon.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 水 です。
        english: It is water.
        hint: This identifies the object as 'water'. We're looking to state the existence of water.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 水 ある？
        english: Is there water?
        hint: This is a question asking if water exists. We're looking for a statement confirming the
          existence of water.
    scene: A person offering a drink to someone who seems thirsty, pointing to a glass of water nearby.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: supportive
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「あります」 (to exist) takes が to mark the subject. Here, が introduces the existence of 「水」 (water)
      as new or specific information relevant to the situation, possibly offering it to someone who needs
      it. This is a polite and direct way to state the presence of something.
  - english: That person is the teacher.
    japanese:
      - あの 人 {が} 先生 です。
      - あの 人 {が} 先生 だ よ。
      - あの 人 {が} 先生 だ。
      - あの 方 {が} 先生 です。
      - あの 方 {が} 先生 で いらっしゃい ます。
      - あの 人 {が} 先生 な ん だ。
      - あの 人 {が} 先生 で ござい ます。
      - あの 人 {が} 先生 でしょ？
      - あの 人 {が} 先生 な の さ。
    english_literally: That person, is the teacher.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 人 は 先生 です。
        english: As for that person, he/she is the teacher.
        hint: The scene emphasizes the identification of a specific person as the teacher, introducing
          this information to the listener. が highlights this new, specific identification rather than
          making a general statement about 'that person'. We're looking to specifically identify someone.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 人 を 先生 です。
        english: That person the teacher.
        hint: This sentence identifies who 'that person' is. が marks the subject of the sentence, not
          an object. 「を」 is used for direct objects, not for linking a subject to its description.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 は あの 人 です。
        english: The teacher is that person.
        hint: This structure emphasizes 'that person' as being the teacher among others. We're looking
          to identify 'that person' as the teacher.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 人 先生。
        english: That person, teacher.
        hint: This is a very informal, clipped expression that omits particles. We're looking for a grammatically
          complete sentence with the subject marked.
    scene: A new student pointing out their teacher in a crowded hallway to a friend who doesn't know
      them.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: This sentence identifies 「あの 人」 (that person) as the subject of the predicate 「先生 です」 (is
      a teacher). Using が here emphasizes that specific person is the teacher, often in a situation where
      the listener doesn't know who the teacher is, thus introducing new information.
  - english: Who is at the door?
    japanese:
      - 誰 {が} ドア に い ます か？
      - 誰 {が} ドア に いる？
      - 誰 {が} ドア に いる の？
      - どなた {が} ドア に いらっしゃい ます か？
      - どなた {が} ドア に いらっしゃる の？
      - 誰 {が} ドア に いる ん だ？
      - 誰 {が} ドア に いる の だろう？
      - どなた {が} ドア に お いで です か？
    english_literally: Who, is at the door?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 誰 は ドア に い ます か？
        english: As for who, is he/she at the door?
        hint: When the subject of a question is an interrogative pronoun like 「誰」 (who) or 「何」 (what),
          が is obligatorily used. The scene naturally sets up a question about an unknown subject. We're
          looking for the proper particle with an interrogative subject.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 誰 を ドア に い ます か？
        english: Whom is at the door?
        hint: When asking 'who' or 'what' is performing an action or existing, が is used to mark the unknown
          subject. 「を」 marks the direct object, indicating who or what is *being acted upon*, which is
          not the case here.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ドア に 誰 か いる？
        english: Is someone at the door?
        hint: This asks if *anyone* is at the door, not specifically 'who'. We're looking to identify
          the unknown person.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ドア の 人 は 誰 です か？
        english: Who is the person at the door?
        hint: This structure asks about the identity of 'the person at the door'. We're looking for a
          question about who is performing the action of being 'at the door'.
    scene: Someone hears a knock and asks who is there.
    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: When the subject of a question is an interrogative word (like 「誰」 or 「何」), が is always used
      to mark it. This is a direct question about an unknown person, focusing on identifying the subject.
  - english: The door opened.
    japanese:
      - ドア {が} 開き まし た。
      - ドア {が} 開い た。
      - 戸 {が} 開い た。
      - ドア {が} 開く よ。
      - 扉 {が} 開い て た。
    english_literally: Door, it opened.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ドア を 開け まし た。
        english: I opened the door.
        hint: This uses the transitive verb 「開ける」 (to open something) with 「を」, indicating an external
          agent performed the action. The current grammar point is about an action that happened spontaneously,
          marked by が. We're looking for an action that happened by itself.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ドア は 開き まし た。
        english: As for the door, it opened.
        hint: While 「は」 is possible, it would imply the door is already a topic of discussion or contrasts
          with something else. が introduces the specific event of the door opening as new information.
          We're looking to simply state that the door opened.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ドア が 開い て い ます。
        english: The door is open.
        hint: This uses the progressive/stative form to describe the *state* of the door (it is currently
          open), not the action of it opening. We're looking for the moment of the action.
    scene: You are alone in a quiet house when a door unexpectedly opens by itself.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: が is typically used with intransitive verbs like 「開く」 (to open, intransitive) to mark the
      subject that undergoes a change or performs an action naturally or spontaneously. It emphasizes
      the subject as the one performing the action, without an external agent.
  - english: I like apples.
    japanese:
      - 私 は リンゴ {が} 好き です。
      - リンゴ {が} 好き。
      - 私 は リンゴ {が} 好き だ よ。
      - りんご {が} 好き です。
      - 私 は りんご {が} 好き です わ。
    english_literally: As for me, apples are likable.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は リンゴ を 好き です。
        english: I like apples.
        hint: The adjective 「好き」 (likeable) takes が to mark its subject (the thing that is liked), not
          「を」, which marks a direct object of a transitive verb. We're looking for the correct particle
          to mark the subject of an adjectival predicate.
      - competing_japanese:
          - リンゴ は 好き です。
        english: As for apples, I like them.
        hint: While 「は」 is possible, it implies a contrast or topic shift. が is used to state directly
          what is liked without a specific contrasting implication. We're looking for a simple statement
          of preference.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は リンゴ に 好き です。
        english: I am fond of apples.
        hint: The particle 「に」 can indicate a target or indirect object, but it's not typically used with
          「好き」 in this sense to mean "like something". We're looking for the particle that marks the thing
          that is liked.
    scene: A friend asks you what kind of fruit you like.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: In Japanese, verbs and adjectives expressing liking, disliking, or ability (e.g., 「好き」) treat
      the object of liking/ability as their grammatical subject. So, 「リンゴが 好き」 literally means "apples
      are likable (to me)", with 「リンゴ」 being the subject marked by が. This usage highlights what is liked
      or disliked.
  - english: I can speak Japanese.
    japanese:
      - 私 は 日本 語 {が} 話せ ます。
      - 日本 語 {が} 話せる よ。
      - 私 は 日本 語 {が} 話せる。
      - 日本 語 {が} 話せ ます か？
      - 日本 語 {が} 話せる わ。
    english_literally: As for me, Japanese is speakable.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 日本 語 を 話せ ます。
        english: I can speak Japanese.
        hint: While 「を」 is sometimes heard informally with potential verbs, が is the grammatically standard
          and preferred particle to mark the object of potential verbs, as it functions as the subject
          of the potential action. We're looking for the grammatically standard particle.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 日本 語 を 話す こと が でき ます。
        english: I am able to speak Japanese.
        hint: This expression also means "can speak Japanese" but uses a noun phrase 「話す こと」 followed
          by 「できる」. The current grammar point is about using が directly with the potential form of a verb.
          We're looking for a direct use of the potential verb.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 日本 語 に 話せ ます。
        english: I am able to speak to Japanese.
        hint: The particle 「に」 would indicate a target or indirect object, which doesn't fit the meaning
          of "can speak Japanese." We're looking for the particle that marks the language that can be
          spoken.
    scene: You are at a job interview and the interviewer asks about your language skills.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: With potential verbs like 「話せる」 (can speak), the object of the potential action (what can
      be spoken) is marked by が because it functions as the grammatical subject of the potential form.
      So, 「日本語が 話せます」 means "Japanese is speakable (by me)". This emphasizes the ability.
  - english: I heard that Tanaka-san came.
    japanese:
      - 田中 さん {が} 来 た と 聞き まし た。
      - 田中 さん {が} 来 た って 聞い た。
      - 田中 さん {が} 来 た そう です。
      - 田中 先生 {が} 来 られ た と 伺い まし た。
    english_literally: Tanaka-san came, I heard.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 田中 さん は 来 た と 聞き まし た。
        english: As for Tanaka-san, I heard he came.
        hint: While 「は」 can be used here, が is preferred when the subject of the embedded clause is the
          new or emphasized information within the reported content. We're focusing on Tanaka-san's arrival
          as the key piece of information.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 田中 さん の 来 た こと を 聞き まし た。
        english: I heard about Tanaka-san's coming.
        hint: This structure uses a noun phrase 「来た こと」. The current grammar point is about marking the
          subject directly within an embedded clause with 「と」. We're looking for a direct report of the
          action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 田中 さん に 来 て もらい まし た と 聞き まし た。
        english: I heard that Tanaka-san was made to come.
        hint: This implies a causative-passive nuance (Tanaka-san was made to come), which is not the
          intended simple statement of arrival. We're looking for a straightforward report of someone's
          arrival.
    scene: You are chatting with a colleague about a recent office event.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: When a clause is embedded using 「と」 to report speech or thought, the subject of that embedded
      clause is marked by が, especially if it introduces new information within the context of the reported
      content. Here, 「田中さん」 is the subject of the embedded clause 「田中さんが 来た」.
  - english: He can do it.
    japanese:
      - 彼 {が} でき ます。
      - 彼 {が} できる よ。
      - あいつ {が} できる。
      - あの 人 {が} でき ます。
      - 彼氏 {が} できる。
      - 彼 {が} できん の？
    english_literally: He, can do.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は でき ます。
        english: As for him, he can do it.
        hint: While 「は」 also implies ability, it would state this as a general fact about him or contrast
          him with someone else in a broader context. が directly answers 'who' by emphasizing *he* is
          the one. We're looking for emphasis on *who* can do it.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 に でき ます。
        english: It is possible for him.
        hint: 「に」 can indicate a target or indirect object, but here it changes the nuance to "it's possible
          for him" rather than "he is capable of doing it." We're looking for a direct statement of his
          capability.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 も でき ます。
        english: He also can do it.
        hint: 「も」 means "also" or "too," implying others can do it as well. が emphasizes that he is the
          *specific* one who can do it, often exclusively. We're looking to single out the subject.
    scene: A team leader is asked if anyone can solve a particular difficult problem, and they confidently
      point to one team member.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: persuasive
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: When が is used with a general ability verb like 「できる」 without an explicit object, and often
      as a direct answer to a "who" question, it carries a strong nuance of emphasizing *that subject
      and only that subject* has the ability, often implying a contrast with others.
  - english: The sky is blue.
    japanese:
      - 空 {が} 青い です。
      - 空 {が} 青い。
    english_literally: Sky, it is blue.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 空 は 青い です。
        english: As for the sky, it is blue.
        hint: While 「は」 is possible, が is used here to emphasize the specific quality of the sky (its
          blueness) as an observation, rather than a general statement about the sky. We're looking to
          highlight a particular characteristic.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 空 を 青い です。
        english: Sky is blue.
        hint: Adjectives like 「青い」 describe qualities and do not take 「を」 to mark an object. が marks the
          subject whose quality is being described. We're looking for the particle that correctly marks
          the subject of an adjective.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 青い 空 です。
        english: It is a blue sky.
        hint: This phrases 'blue sky' as a noun, but does not specify that the sky *is* blue. We're looking
          for a sentence that predicates 'blue' of 'sky'.
    scene: You are looking out the window on a beautiful, clear day.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: This uses が to mark 「空」 (sky) as the subject of the adjective 「青い」 (blue). It emphasizes the
      specific characteristic of the sky, highlighting its blueness as an observation.
post_example_writeup: Remember that が is used to mark the subject of a sentence when it is new information
  or when emphasizing the subject. Context and intent heavily influence particle choice. For example,
  the sentence 「私 は 学生 です」 uses the particle は because it introduces "I" as the topic, while 「私 {が} 学生
  です」 might be used to emphasize that *I* am the student, not someone else. Pay close attention to whether
  the subject is new information, being highlighted for emphasis, or is the grammatical subject of certain
  verbs and adjectives (like those of liking/disliking or potential).
