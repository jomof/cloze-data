    "etymology": "The particle が is believed to have originated from the classical Japanese genitive particle 'ga' (meaning \"of\"). Over time, it evolved to mark the subject in certain sentence structures, distinguishing it from the topic marker は.",
    "writeup": "が is the subject marker in Japanese. It identifies the performer of an action or something with a specific feature, especially when the listener is unaware. Unlike は, which highlights the topic, が emphasizes what precedes it. が focuses on the 'target' of a statement in relation to other possible targets, often used for situations happening 'in the moment' or independently. Be careful when describing yourself; は is usually more natural unless you're contrasting yourself with others.",
