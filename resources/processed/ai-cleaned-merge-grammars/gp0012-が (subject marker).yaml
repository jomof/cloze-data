jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: teineigo (polite)
  particle-syntactic-function: case-marking
  particle-pragmatic-function: emphasis
  usage-context: Generally used in various contexts, particularly when introducing new information or
    emphasizing the subject.
  function: Identifies the grammatical subject, often introducing new information or emphasizing it.
  nuance: Highlights the specific subject, contrasting it with other possibilities or presenting it as
    newly observed information.
etymology: The particle が is believed to have originated from the classical Japanese genitive particle
  'ga' (meaning "of"). Over time, it evolved to mark the subject in certain sentence structures, distinguishing
  it from the topic marker は.
writeup: が is the subject marker in Japanese. It identifies the performer of an action or something with
  a specific feature, especially when the listener is unaware. Unlike は, which highlights the topic, が
  emphasizes what precedes it. が focuses on the 'target' of a statement in relation to other possible
  targets, often used for situations happening 'in the moment' or independently. Be careful when describing
  yourself; は is usually more natural unless you're contrasting yourself with others.
false_friends:
  - term: は
    meaning: As for... (Highlights sentence topic)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike が, は marks the topic of the sentence, indicating already known information or establishing
      a general context.
    grammar_point: は (topic and contrast)
  - term: を
    meaning: Object marking particle
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike が, を marks the direct object of a transitive verb, indicating what is being acted upon,
      rather than the subject performing the action.
    grammar_point: を (object marker)
post_false_friends_writeup: は indicates the topic of a sentence, something already known or being discussed,
  while が introduces the subject or emphasizes it. を, on the other hand, marks the direct object of a
  verb, indicating what is being acted upon.
examples:
  - english: It's raining.
    japanese:
      - 雨 {が} 降っ て い ます。
      - 雨 {が} 降っ て いる。
      - 雨 {が} 降っ てる。
      - 雨 {が} 降っ て い ます ね。
      - 雨 {が} 降っ てる よ。
      - 雨 {が} 降っ てる ぜ。
      - 雨 {が} 降っ てる わ。
    english_literally: Rain, it is falling.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 雨 {は} 降っ て い ます。
        english: As for rain, it is falling.
        hint: 「は」 marks the general topic, but this sentence introduces rain as new information, not a
          general fact. We're looking for an observation of new information.
    scene: A person looks out the window and notices it has started raining.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 'This sentence introduces the fact of rain as new information. The action is happening now,
      and the speaker is observing it. The use of が highlights the current, specific event. 「降って います」
      is the progressive form, indicating an ongoing action. The sentence structure focuses on the subject
      「雨」 being the new information. The casual register with 「降っ てる わ」 is suitable for a reflective mood,
      and the particle 「わ」 adds a soft, feminine touch to the observation. The speaker is simply noting
      an event, not trying to engage a listener, which aligns with the ''no one'' listener gender. This
      example is simple and common, demonstrating a core function of が with an intransitive verb in an
      observational context. The progressive form indicates an ongoing action, emphasizing the ''now''
      aspect of the new information being presented by が. The selection of casual register and female
      speaker gender shows how such an observation might be naturally voiced in everyday Japanese, which
      is crucial for students to grasp natural usage patterns beyond just grammatical rules. This also
      provides an opportunity to observe how particle usage can differ slightly based on gendered speech
      patterns, further enriching the example''s pedagogical value. This particular example showcases
      a fundamental use of が: introducing a new subject that is performing an action, particularly an
      intransitive one. The nuance is that the speaker is simply observing a new event (the rain falling),
      not making a general statement about rain. The choice of 「わ」 as a sentence-ending particle further
      softens the statement, typical for female speakers in a reflective setting, adding naturalness to
      the example. The various Japanese translations illustrate the versatility of the phrase across different
      levels of formality and nuance, reinforcing the core concept of が as a subject marker.'
  - english: Who came to the party?
    japanese:
      - パーティー に 誰 {が} 来 まし た か。
      - パーティー に 誰 {が} 来 た の？
    english_literally: To the party, who came?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - パーティー {は} 誰 です か。
        english: As for the party, who is it?
        hint: This question asks to identify the specific person who performed the action, not about the
          general identity of the party itself. We're looking for the subject of the action.
    scene: You are asking about a specific person's attendance at an event.
    register: formal
    setting: interrogative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: This sentence uses が to inquire about the specific subject (誰) of the action (来た). It seeks
      to identify new, unknown information. The use of ですか makes it polite, suitable for a formal setting.
      The question is direct, focusing on identification.
  - english: The cake is delicious.
    japanese:
      - その ケーキ {が} 美味しい です。
      - その ケーキ {が} おいしい よ。
    english_literally: That cake, it is delicious.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ケーキ {は} 美味しい です。
        english: As for cakes, they are delicious.
        hint: The nuance here is that *this specific cake* is delicious, perhaps among others. 「は」 would
          make a general statement about cakes. We're pointing out a specific delicious item.
    scene: You are trying a piece of cake and find it exceptionally good, wanting to highlight that particular
      cake.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: Using が here emphasizes that it is 'that particular cake' which is delicious, possibly distinguishing
      it from other cakes or expressing a newfound appreciation. This is common when making an observation
      about a specific item. 「美味しい です」 is a polite and direct way to express the taste.
  - english: My stomach hurts.
    japanese:
      - お腹 {が} 痛い です。
      - お腹 {が} 痛い の。
    english_literally: Stomach, it is painful.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - お腹 {は} 痛い です。
        english: As for my stomach, it hurts.
        hint: When talking about body parts and their conditions, が is naturally used for the subject.
          「は」 would imply contrast or a general statement about stomachs. We're describing a current,
          specific state.
    scene: You are explaining to a friend why you can't eat anymore.
    register: casual
    setting: apologetic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: When expressing physical sensations or conditions, が is almost always used as the subject
      marker (e.g., 頭 が 痛い - 'my head hurts', 喉 が 渇く - 'my throat is dry'). It identifies the part of
      the body that is experiencing the sensation. The casual 「の」 at the end in the second example softens
      the statement, making it sound more like an explanation or a slight complaint.
  - english: I can speak Japanese.
    japanese:
      - 私 は 日本 語 {が} 話せ ます。
      - 僕 は 日本 語 {が} 話せる よ。
    english_literally: As for me, Japanese can be spoken.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 {は} 日本 語 {を} 話せ ます。
        english: As for me, I can speak Japanese.
        hint: With potential verbs (like 話せる 'can speak'), the object is typically marked with が, not
          を. We're describing an ability.
    scene: Someone asks if you are able to communicate in Japanese.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: When verbs express potential (e.g., 読める 'can read', 飲める 'can drink', 分かる 'understand'), the
      object of the verb is usually marked with が, not を. This is a common and important distinction in
      Japanese grammar. 「僕」 is a common male first-person pronoun in casual speech. The polite 「話せ ます」
      is appropriate for a polite setting.
  - english: Suddenly, a strange sound was heard.
    japanese:
      - 突然、変 な 音 {が} 聞こえ まし た。
      - 突然、変 な 音 {が} 聞こえ た の。
    english_literally: Suddenly, strange sound, it was heard.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 突然、変 な 音 {を} 聞き まし た。
        english: Suddenly, I heard a strange sound.
        hint: 「聞く」 (to listen actively) uses を, but 「聞こえる」 (to be audible, heard spontaneously) uses が
          for the sound itself. We're looking for something that was heard without active effort.
    scene: You are telling a friend about a mysterious event you experienced.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: Verbs of spontaneous perception like 聞こえる (to be audible) and 見える (to be visible) take が for
      the thing being perceived. This highlights that the sound was not actively sought out but simply
      'entered' the speaker's perception. The casual 「の」 adds a narrative or explanatory tone.
  - english: There is a cat sleeping under the table.
    japanese:
      - テーブル の 下 に 猫 {が} 寝 て い ます。
      - テーブル の 下 に 猫 {が} 寝 てる よ。
    english_literally: Table's under, cat, it is sleeping.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - テーブル の 下 に 猫 {は} 寝 て い ます。
        english: As for under the table, a cat is sleeping.
        hint: This sentence introduces the cat as new information in a specific location. 「は」 would make
          the cat the topic, implying it's already known. We're pointing out a new discovery.
    scene: You enter a room and immediately notice a cat sleeping in an unexpected place.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: が is used with verbs of existence like います (for animate objects) or あります (for inanimate objects)
      when introducing something new into the scene or when the existence itself is the new information.
      This is particularly common after a location particle (e.g., に). The casual 「よ」 emphasizes the new
      information for the listener.
  - english: A strong wind is blowing.
    japanese:
      - 強い 風 {が} 吹い て い ます。
      - 強い 風 {が} 吹い てる。
    english_literally: Strong wind, it is blowing.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 {は} 風 {は} 強い です。
        english: As for today, the wind is strong.
        hint: This sentence describes the specific action of the wind blowing, not a general characteristic
          of the wind or today's weather. We're focusing on the wind itself as the actor.
    scene: You are caught outside in unexpectedly harsh weather.
    register: casual
    setting: emergency/alarm
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: When describing natural phenomena (like wind blowing, earthquakes happening, or rain falling),
      が is typically used to mark the natural force as the subject, especially when it's an immediate
      observation or event. This usage is common because these phenomena are not controlled by an agent.
      The omission of the polite ます makes it more casual and immediate, fitting the setting.
  - english: It was I who made this document.
    japanese:
      - この 書類 を 作っ た の は 私 {が} です。
      - この 書類 を 作っ た の は 僕 {が} やっ た ん だ。
    english_literally: This document, the one who made, it is I.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 書類 {を} 私 {は} 作り まし た。
        english: As for this document, I made it.
        hint: This structure emphasizes the specific actor (私) rather than just stating that 'I made the
          document'. 「は」 would be a general statement. We're highlighting 'who' did it.
    scene: Your boss is looking for the creator of a document, and you want to specifically identify yourself
      as the one.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: This example uses the のは...が...です structure, which strongly emphasizes the subject. It’s used
      to highlight 'who' or 'what' performed an action, often in response to a question of identification,
      similar to an English cleft sentence like 'It was I who did X'. 「僕 が やった ん だ」 is a very casual,
      slightly assertive way a male speaker might say it.
  - english: Something good happened today.
    japanese:
      - 今日 は いい こと {が} あり まし た。
      - 今日 は いい こと {が} あっ た よ。
    english_literally: Today, good thing, it happened.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 {は} いい こと {は} あり まし た。
        english: As for today, good things happened.
        hint: が introduces the 'good thing' as new information that 'happened'. 「は」 would imply a general
          statement about good things or a contrast. We're reporting a specific occurrence.
    scene: You're chatting with a friend about your day, and something positive occurred.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: This sentence uses が to introduce a new event or occurrence (いい こと) that happened. When talking
      about things that 'exist' or 'occur' without a direct agent (like あります/あります), が often marks the
      subject of existence or happening. The phrase 「いい こと」 means 'a good thing', and が marks it as the
      subject of the verb 「ありました」 (happened/existed). The casual 「よ」 emphasizes the good news for the
      listener.
post_example_writeup: As seen in these examples, the particle が serves a crucial role in Japanese by clearly
  marking the grammatical subject of a sentence, especially when introducing new information, identifying
  a specific entity, or describing states and spontaneous occurrences. While it is sometimes compared
  to the topic marker は, remember that が focuses on the *who* or *what* of the action or state, bringing
  that element into immediate focus.
