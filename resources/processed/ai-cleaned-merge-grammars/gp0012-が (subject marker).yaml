etymology: 'The particle が has roots in Old Japanese, where it served as a genitive case particle (similar
  to modern の) and an honorific possessive marker. Over time, its function evolved, and it became primarily
  used to mark the grammatical subject. This historical development contributes to its nuance today: when
  が marks a subject, it often singles out or highlights that element, especially when it introduces new
  information or specifies which entity performs an action or possesses a quality. This ''singling out''
  can be seen as a vestige of its earlier identifying and possessive roles, contrasting with は which often
  sets a broader, already established topic.'
writeup: |-
  The particle が (ga) is a fundamental subject marker in Japanese. Its primary role is to identify the grammatical subject of a sentence, indicating who or what is performing an action or experiencing a state. While English primarily uses word order, Japanese relies on particles like が to clarify grammatical roles.

  A key distinction often made is between が and は (wa). While both can appear with subjects, their nuances differ significantly. が is typically used when introducing new information about the subject, answering a 'who?' or 'what?' question, or emphasizing the subject itself. For instance, if someone asks '誰が来ましたか' (Dare ga kimashita ka? - Who came?), the answer would likely use が, such as '田中さんが来ました' (Tanaka-san ga kimashita - Tanaka-san came), because Tanaka-san is the new, specific information being identified.

  が is also consistently used with verbs that express potential (e.g., できる - dekiru, 'can do'), desire (e.g., 〜たい - -tai, 'want to do'), and certain adjectives (e.g., 好きだ - suki da, 'like'; 欲しい - hoshii, 'want'). In these cases, が marks the object of the potential, desire, or liking, even though it functions grammatically like the subject of the adjective or potential verb. For example, '日本語が話せます' (Nihongo ga hanasemasu - I can speak Japanese) or '寿司が食べたい' (Sushi ga tabetai - I want to eat sushi).

  Furthermore, が is essential in subordinate clauses to mark their respective subjects, particularly when the subject of the subordinate clause is different from the main clause's subject or topic. It is also common with natural phenomena verbs where no specific agent is implied, like '雨が降っている' (Ame ga futte iru - It is raining).

  Understanding the subtle differences between が and は is crucial for natural Japanese expression.

  - term: は (topic and contrast)
    meaning: topic marker or contrast marker
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: が identifies the subject and often introduces new information, while は marks the topic, which
      is usually already known or implied, and can also indicate contrast. が is for identification, は
      is for establishing context.
    grammar_point: は (topic and contrast)
post_false_friends_writeup: While both が and は indicate something about the subject or topic, their roles
  in conveying information are distinct. が introduces new information or specifies the subject. It answers
  'who/what' did or is something. は, on the other hand, typically introduces information about an already
  established topic or sets a scene. It can also highlight a contrast. To avoid mixing them up, consider
  whether you are identifying a specific subject (が) or making a statement about a broader, often known,
  topic (は).
examples:
  - english: Who broke the vase? Taro broke it.
    japanese:
      - 誰 が 花瓶 を 割り まし た か。
      - 太郎 が 割り まし た。
      - 誰 が 花瓶 を 割っ た の？
      - 太郎 が 割っ た。
    english_literally: Who vase broke? Taro broke.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 誰 は 花瓶 を 割り まし た か。
        english: As for who, broke the vase?
        hint: 「は」 marks the topic or emphasizes contrast, but it's generally not used with interrogative
          pronouns like 誰 (who) when asking for specific identification. We're looking to identify the
          specific subject.
    scene: A parent asks their child about a broken vase.
    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    nuance: The first 「誰が」 asks to identify the specific subject. The response 「太郎が」 uses が to directly
      answer and emphasize that Taro is the one who performed the action, specifying new information.
  - english: That cat is cute.
    japanese:
      - あの 猫 が かわいい です。

      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 猫 は かわいい です。
        english: As for that cat, it is cute.
        hint: While grammatically correct, using 「は」 would imply that the cuteness is general knowledge
          about the cat or setting a topic. 「が」 highlights the cat as the specific subject that is cute,
          often used when introducing the cat or its quality for the first time.
    scene: You spot a cat and point it out to a friend.

        hint: 「は」 is generally not used with verbs of existence like います/あります unless it's for contrast
          (e.g., 'There's no dog, but there IS a cat'). 「が」 is used to simply state that something exists.
    scene: You are telling someone about seeing a cat.

          verbs.
    scene: You are discussing your language abilities with a new acquaintance.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: With potential verbs (e.g., 話せる - hanaseru, 'can speak'), が marks the object of capability
      (日本語 - Nihongo), treating it grammatically like the subject for the potential verb, emphasizing
      what *can* be done.

    japanese:

        english: As for me, I want to eat sushi.
        hint: Similar to potential verbs, with desiderative expressions like 〜たい (tai), が is the standard
          particle to mark the object of desire. We're looking for the most common and natural choice
          here.
    scene: At a restaurant, you are deciding what to order.
    register: teineigo (polite)

      - sushi), which functions as the grammatical subject for the adjective. This highlights the specific
      thing desired.

          that possesses the quality of brightness, often used when newly observing or pointing out this
          characteristic.
