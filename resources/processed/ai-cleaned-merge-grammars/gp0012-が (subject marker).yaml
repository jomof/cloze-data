    "etymology": "The particle が is believed to have originated from the classical Japanese genitive particle 'ga' (meaning \"of\"). Over time, it evolved to mark the subject in certain sentence structures, distinguishing it from the topic marker は.",
    "writeup": "が is the subject marker in Japanese. It identifies the performer of an action or something with a specific feature, especially when the listener is unaware. Unlike は, which highlights the topic, が emphasizes what precedes it. が focuses on the 'target' of a statement in relation to other possible targets, often used for situations happening 'in the moment' or independently. Be careful when describing yourself; は is usually more natural unless you're contrasting yourself with others.",

                    "mitigation": "This scene emphasizes the specific tree's height as a new observation or point of focus, which aligns with が's function of marking new information or emphasizing the subject. If one were simply stating a general characteristic of trees, は might be used."

            "nuance": "The plain form 「高い」 indicates a casual register, often used among friends or family. A young boy might use this when pointing out a specific tree to his mother, emphasizing that *this tree* is tall, distinguishing it from other trees or general knowledge. The emphasis on the subject (木) is conveyed by が.",
