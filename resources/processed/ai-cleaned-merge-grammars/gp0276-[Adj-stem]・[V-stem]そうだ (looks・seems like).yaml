  details:
    part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
    register: teineigo (polite)
    usage-context: Used to convey impressions based on direct sensory information or immediate observation.
    nuance: This specific 「そう」 focuses purely on direct observation and impression.
    counterpoint: Be mindful of the context to differentiate 「そう」 meaning "it seems" from other uses of
      「そう」, such as the 「伝聞・様態のそう」 which indicates hearsay (e.g., 「～だそうだ」 meaning "I hear that...") or describes
      the manner of an action (e.g., 「～ように」 meaning "as if...").
  etymology: The grammar point 「そう」 originates from a contraction of 「様 (さま)」 (form, appearance) and the
    classical auxiliary verb 「なり」 (meaning 'to be' or 'to become'). Thus, 「様なり」 evolved into 「そう」, signifying
    something "is like an appearance" or "takes on a certain form/look." This root explains its function
    in describing impressions based on direct observation.
  writeup: |-
    The grammar point 「そうに・そうな」 expresses that something "seems like" or "looks like" something else. It is used to convey impressions based on direct sensory information, such as visual observation or auditory perception. It implies a judgment or inference based on outward appearance.

    *   「そうに」 functions as an adverb, modifying verbs or adjectives. It describes the manner in which an action is performed or a state exists, based on its appearance.
    *   「そうな」 functions as an adjectival noun (な-adjective), modifying nouns. It describes a noun by its apparent state or quality.

    **Important Considerations**

    *   When using 「そう」 with negative verb forms, remove the 「い」 from the plain negative 「ない」 and attach 「そう」. For example, 「する」 (to do) becomes 「しなさそう」 (doesn't look like it will do), not 「しなそう」.
    *   Similarly, for negative い-adjectives, the 「い」 from 「ない」 is removed and 「さ」 is added before attaching 「そう」, resulting in 「なさそう」. For example, 「おいしい」 (delicious) becomes 「おいしくなさそう」 (doesn't look delicious).

    - term: げ
      meaning: Seemingly, Giving appearance of, [Expresses emotions or feelings]
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「げ」 directly expresses a person's internal feelings that are evident externally, like 'sad-looking'
        (悲しげ), while 「そうに/そうな」 describes a general appearance or impression of a state or action, not limited
        to emotions (e.g., 'looks tasty' (美味しそう)).
      grammar_point: げ (seeming・appearance)
    - term: ように・ような
      meaning: As・like, Just like
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「ように/ような」 indicates a direct comparison or resemblance (e.g., 'like a dream' (夢のように)), while
        「そうに/そうな」 suggests an indirect impression or appearance based on observation (e.g., 'looks like
        it's going to rain' (雨が降りそう)).
      grammar_point: ように・ような (like・as・similar to)
    - term: ようだ
      meaning: It seems that, It appears that, It looks like
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「ようだ」 expresses a judgment or conclusion based on indirect evidence or inference (e.g., 'It
        seems he's tired' (疲れているようだ)), while 「そうに/そうな」 is based on a more direct sensory impression, often
        visual (e.g., 'He looks tired' (疲れてそう)).
      grammar_point: ようだ (it seems)
    - term: みたい
      meaning: Like, similar to, resembling; seems like
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「みたい」 implies a casual comparison based on shared characteristics (e.g., 'like a child' (子供みたい)),
        while 「そうに/そうな」 conveys a more subtle or nuanced impression of an observed state or likelihood.
      grammar_point: みたい (appears・resembles)
    - term: 見える
      meaning: To be visible, to seem, to be in sight.
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「見える」 is a potential verb indicating what is visually perceptible (e.g., 'Mount Fuji is visible'
        (富士山が見える)), while 「そうに/そうな」 describes the manner or quality of that appearance, or what is likely
        to happen based on appearance (e.g., 'It looks good' (美味しそうに見える)).
      grammar_point: 見える (to be visible・to seem)
    - term: らしい
      meaning: Indicates hearsay, conjecture, or something that seems to be the case based on available
        information.
      kind: often confused with
      nuance: 「らしい」 suggests an impression or conclusion based on indirect evidence or hearsay (e.g., 'I
        heard it's good' (良いらしい)), whereas 「そうに/そうな」 expresses an impression derived from direct sensory
        observation (e.g., 'It looks good' (良さそう)).
      grammar_point: らしい (I hear, it seems)
    - term: そうにない・そうもない (unlikely to)
      meaning: Very unlikely to, does not seem that, does not appear that
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While the main grammar point 「そうに/そうな」 indicates something is likely to happen or appear a
        certain way, 「そうもない」 expresses the strong unlikelihood of something happening or appearing that
        way, often based on current observations or conditions.
      grammar_point: そうにない・そうもない (unlikely to)
  post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share similarities with 「そうに・そうな」, they each carry
    unique nuances. 「ように」 and 「みたい」 imply a more direct comparison or resemblance, whereas 「そうに・そうな」 suggests
    a subjective impression based on immediate sensory input. 「見える」 focuses on visual perception, while
    「そうに・そうな」 describes the quality or manner of that appearance, or a prediction based on appearance. 「らしい」
    conveys information based on hearsay or indirect evidence, unlike 「そうに・そうな」 which stems from direct
    observation. Using these expressions correctly requires careful attention to the specific context and
    desired nuance.
  examples:
    - english: He looked like he was about to cry at any moment.
      japanese:

        - 彼 は 今 に も 泣き {そう だっ た}。
        - 彼、今 に も 泣き {そう だっ た} よ。

            - 彼 は 今 に も 泣く と {思う}。
          english: I think he will cry at any moment.
          hint: The scene emphasizes the visual 'look' of being on the verge of crying, which is captured
            by '泣きそうに', rather than a general thought or assumption about his actions. We're looking for
            a phrase describing an appearance based on observation.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 は 今 に も 泣く か も しれ {ない}。
          english: He might cry at any moment.
          hint: The scene focuses on the direct appearance, not just a possibility, distinguishing 'そうに'

        impending action. The use of 「そうに」 here emphasizes the visual cue of his face and body language.
      etymology: The expression 「今にも～そうだ」 is a common collocation to describe something that appears to
        be on the verge of happening, emphasizing the immediate visual signs of an impending event. The
        「今にも」 part indicates immediacy, strengthening the predictive sense of 「～そう」. It captures the sense
        of observable readiness.

          english: This cake is pretty, but it probably won't sell much.
          hint: This specifically highlights the *appearance* or *impression* that leads to the prediction,
            rather than just a general probability. We're looking for a phrase about how it *appears* it
            will not sell.
      scene: A pastry chef is discussing a new cake with a colleague.
      register: casual
      setting: professional
      conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
      nuance: 「売れなさそうな」 is a negative prediction based on visual appeal (or lack thereof). 「売れない」 (will
        not sell) becomes 「売れなさそうな」, modifying 「感じ」 (feeling/impression). This signifies an outward appearance
        suggesting poor sales.
    - english: This dress looks pretty, but it doesn't look expensive.
      japanese:

          english: This dress is pretty, but I think it's not expensive.
          hint: This implies a judgment based on visual observation and the impression it gives, not just
            a personal opinion. We're looking for a phrase that describes a negative appearance.
      scene: Two friends are shopping for clothes.
      register: casual
      setting: friendly
      conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
      nuance: 「高くなさそうな」 describes the dress's appearance as not seeming expensive. 「高い」 (expensive) loses
        its 「い」, takes 「く」, then 「ない」 becomes 「なさそうな」, modifying 「感じ」. This conveys a visual impression
        of being inexpensive.
  post_example_writeup: These examples demonstrate how 「そうに・そうな」 functions by conveying an impression or
    appearance rather than a definitive statement. The context, such as visual cues or observed behavior,
    is crucial for understanding its usage. Remember that 「そうに」 modifies verbs or adjectives, describing
    the *manner* of an action or state, while 「そうな」 modifies nouns, describing the *apparent quality* of
    a noun. Pay close attention to the distinction between direct facts and observed impressions to choose
    the correct expression.

  details:
    part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
    register: semi-formal
    function: Indicates the speaker's conjecture concerning a future event or present state based on visual
      information or immediate feeling.
    nuance: Used for predictions or guesses based on visual information, conveying a relatively low confidence
      level. It suggests an impression rather than a definitive statement.
    grammatical-role: modifies verbs, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives to express appearance or likelihood
      based on observation
  etymology: The grammar point 「そう」 originates from the verb 「添う (そう)」, which means "to accompany" or "to
    conform". Over time, it evolved to express the idea of something appearing or seeming to conform to
    a certain state, based on observation or feeling.
  writeup: |-
    「そう」 is an auxiliary adjective used to express that something "seems" or "appears" a certain way, based on direct observation or an immediate impression. It is frequently translated as "seems like," "looks like," or "appears as though."

    This 「そう」 primarily conveys a conjecture about a future event or the present state of someone or something, derived from visual cues or sensory input. It carries a relatively **low confidence level**, implying an an educated guess rather than an obvious fact. For situations where something is evident or has a stronger resemblance, other expressions like 「みたい」 or 「らしい」 might be more suitable.

    ### Formation Rules:
    *   **Verbs**: Attach 「そう」 to the **masu-stem** of a verb. For example, 「降ります (furimasu)」 becomes 「降りそう (furisou)」.
    *   **い-adjectives**: Remove the final 「い」 and attach 「そう」. For example, 「難しい (muzukashii)」 becomes 「難しそう (muzukashisou)」.
    *   **な-adjectives**: Attach 「そう」 directly to the stem. For example, 「静か (shizuka)」 becomes 「静かそう (shizukasou)」.

    ### Negative Form Considerations:
    When expressing that something "does not seem" a certain way:
    *   For **い-adjectives**: The negative form often uses 「なさそう」. For example, 「美味しくない (oishikunai)」 (not delicious) becomes 「美味しくなさそう (oishikunasa sou)」 (doesn't look delicious). The 「さ」 is inserted before 「そう」.
    *   For **verbs**: The negative form commonly uses 「そうにない」 or 「そうもない」. For example, 「食べない (tabenai)」 (not eat) becomes 「食べそうにない (tabesou ni nai)」 (doesn't look like they'll eat). Note that these are idiomatic expressions and are often listed as separate grammar points due to their specific nuance of "unlikely to."

    It is crucial to distinguish this 「そう」 from the homophonous 「そうだ」 that means "I heard that..." (伝聞のそうだ), which conveys secondhand information rather than a visual impression. The formation and nuance differ significantly between the two.

        at the moment.
      grammar_point: っぽい (ish; characteristic of)
  post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 「そう」 with similar expressions, remember that 「そう」 relies
    on immediate sensory input and conveys a lower confidence level compared to expressions like 「みたい」 or
    「らしい」. Unlike 「ように」, it does not directly compare nouns or indicate a manner of action. Always consider
    whether your statement is based on direct observation or other sources of information when choosing
    the appropriate expression.

      scene: A coach observing an athlete who shows no signs of fatigue.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: serious
      conjugation: negative plain (～ない)

          english: The train is so crowded it doesn't look like it's about to burst.
          hint: 「そうもない」 expresses a strong unlikelihood of something happening, which contradicts the visual
            impression of extreme crowding leading to bursting. We're looking for an affirmative likelihood
            here.

        - competing_japanese:
            - 電車 は とても 混ん で い て、今 に も {破裂 する よう な 気 が する}。

          english: She is like she is healthy, isn't she?

            assessment based on current appearance.

            observation.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼女 は {元気 に 見え ます} ね。
          english: She appears healthy, isn't she?

            impression or conjecture based on observation.

            - 彼女 は {元気 そう に ない} です ね。
          english: She doesn't look healthy, does she?
          hint: 「そうにない」 is the negative form, indicating she does not appear healthy, which is the opposite
            of what we want to convey here.
      scene: Two friends discussing a mutual friend who has recovered from an illness.
      register: teineigo (polite)
      setting: optimistic
      conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
      nuance: 「元気そう」 directly describes her appearance, indicating she looks well, conveying relief based
        on visible signs. The polite 「です」 makes it suitable for a respectful and friendly conversation.
        The use of 「元気」 (healthy/energetic) as a な-adjective stem directly attaches to 「そう」.
  post_example_writeup: Understanding the core nuance of 「そう」 as being based on immediate, often visual,
    observation is key to differentiating it from similar expressions. While other terms might convey likelihood
    or appearance, 「そう」 specifically emphasizes a judgment formed from what is perceived directly in the
    moment. Remember that its negative forms 「そうにない」 and 「そうもない」 are particularly strong in indicating unlikelihood,
    making them distinct from simple negative appearances.
