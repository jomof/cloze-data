jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used for expressing an impression or immediate prediction based on direct observation.
  function: Expresses appearance, likelihood, or immediate prediction based on what is observed.
  nuance: This usage of そうだ is based on direct sensory observation (primarily visual). It describes how
    something appears to look or how it seems like it will be/do, based on observable signs. It implies
    a direct, objective assessment of appearance.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a predicate, modifying the preceding verb or adjective stem to describe
    an appearance or likelihood.
etymology: The auxiliary adjective そうだ (to look, to seem) originates from the classical verb そう (sou),
  meaning "to appear" or "to seem visible." It is often considered a derivative of a word indicating visual
  perception. This direct connection to sensory observation explains its usage in describing appearances
  based on what one sees or feels. This is distinct from the other そうだ (hearsay), which functions differently.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「[Adj-stem]・[V-stem]そうだ」, meaning "it looks like" or "it seems like," is used to describe an impression or prediction based on direct observation. This 「そうだ」 attaches to the ます-stem of verbs, the stem of い-adjectives (dropping the final 「い」), and the stem of な-adjectives (dropping the final 「な」 or 「だ」).

  When attached to a verb's ます-stem, it indicates that something appears likely to happen or is on the verge of happening. For example, 「雨が降りそうだ」 means "it looks like it's going to rain." When attached to the stem of an い-adjective, it describes the appearance of a quality, such as 「美味しそうだ」 for "looks delicious." For な-adjectives, it similarly describes an appearance, like 「元気そうだ」 for "looks healthy." In formal contexts, 「そうです」 is used instead of 「そうだ」 at the end of the sentence.

  It is important to note that this 「そうだ」 is purely based on what is visually or directly observed. It conveys a direct impression rather than a conclusion drawn from indirect information or personal inference.
false_friends:
  - term: そうだ (hearsay)
    meaning: I hear that; It is said that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike そうだ (looks/seems), this そうだ (hearsay) is used to report information heard from elsewhere.
      It attaches to the plain form of verbs and adjectives, and だ for nouns/な-adjectives. It is not based
      on direct observation but rather on secondhand information.
    grammar_point: そうだ (hear that)
  - term: ようだ
    meaning: It seems that, It appears that, It looks like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While similar in meaning, ようだ is more about subjective impression or inference, and can be
      used for things not directly observed or to express uncertainty. そうだ (looks/seems) is based on direct
      visual evidence and conveys a more immediate, observable impression.
    grammar_point: ようだ (it seems)
  - term: らしい
    meaning: It seems; it appears; I heard; it's typical of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: らしい conveys an impression based on indirect information, common knowledge, or a strong sense
      of typicality, often implying a logical conclusion rather than a direct observation. そうだ (looks/seems)
      is primarily for direct visual observations.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Sentence] らしい (it seems・I hear)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'It is crucial to differentiate between the two usages of そうだ: the one indicating
  appearance (based on direct observation) and the one indicating hearsay (based on reported information).
  While both can be translated as "it seems" or "it looks like," their grammatical connections and underlying
  meanings are distinct. The appearance そうだ connects to verb/adjective stems, whereas the hearsay そうだ
  connects to plain forms. Additionally, ようだ and らしい also mean "it seems," but they differ in the source
  and certainty of the information. ようだ often implies a subjective inference or educated guess, possibly
  from indirect evidence. らしい suggests a conclusion based on external information or a sense of typicality,
  implying that something is ''like'' what it should be. Thus, そうだ (appearance) is the most direct and
  visually grounded of these expressions.'

          - この 食べ物 は 辛い {だろう}。
        english: This food is probably spicy.
        hint: 「だろう」 is a conjecture about spiciness. 「辛そうだ」 is a direct observation of its appearance
          (e.g., bright red color).
    scene: Looking at a dish at a restaurant that has a lot of red chili.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
post_example_writeup: When using そうだ to describe appearance, pay close attention to the stem form of the
  verb or adjective. For verbs, always use the ます-stem. For い-adjectives, drop the final い. For な-adjectives,
  use the stem without な or だ. This strict connection rule helps distinguish it from other similar-sounding
  grammatical structures. The nuance conveyed is always that of an impression based on direct sensory
  input, making it a powerful tool for describing immediate perceptions.
