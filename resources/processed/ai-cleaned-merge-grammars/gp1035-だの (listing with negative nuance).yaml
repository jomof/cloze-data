  register: casual
  particle-syntactic-function: listing
  particle-pragmatic-function: emphasis
  usage-context: General
etymology: The particle 「だの」 originates from a combination of the auxiliary verb 「だ」 (a form of 「です」)
  and the case-marking particle 「の」. Over time, it has evolved into a standalone adverbial particle. Its
  function expanded from simply indicating possession or association (like 'of') to listing examples,
  especially those that evoke a sense of dissatisfaction or exasperation in the speaker. The initial 'だ'
  serves as a copula, marking the preceding item, and 'の' then links it as an example within a broader
  context, leading to its current meaning of listing unsatisfactory items 'and such'.
writeup: |-
  「だの」 is used to present a list of examples, similar to 「など」 and 「とか」. It implies "and things like (A)" or "(A) and whatnot." It's used when giving at least two examples, each followed by 「だの」. These examples are often opposites or share a negative trait.

  **Important Considerations**:

  *   When the listed items are opposites, 「だの」 indicates a wide range to which a rule applies.
  *   When the listed items are similar, it expresses undesirable aspects within a specific category.
  *   Overall, 「だの」 emphasizes the speaker's frustration or boredom regarding things falling under that category or scope.
false_friends:
  - term: など
    meaning: such as, and so on, among others
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「など」 is a neutral particle used to give examples without implying a negative judgment or the
      speaker's frustration, unlike 「だの」. It merely indicates 'and the like' or 'etc.' without added nuance.
    grammar_point: など・なんか・なんて・などと (such as, things like)
  - term: とか
    meaning: things like, or something, for example
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とか」 is a casual particle used to list examples, often with a sense of vagueness or non-exhaustiveness.
      While casual like 「だの」, it lacks 「だの」's strong connotation of annoyance, frustration, or dismissal
      towards the listed items.
    grammar_point: とか (hearsay)
  - term: たり〜たりする
    meaning: do things like... and...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～たり～たりする」 is used to list a non-exhaustive set of actions or states, typically implying variability
      or intermittence. It is generally neutral and does not carry the negative or dismissive nuance that
      「だの」 often conveys when listing undesirable examples or complaints.
    grammar_point: たり〜たりする (do things like x and y)
  - term: も〜ば〜も〜
    meaning: sometimes... and sometimes...; there are times when... and there are times when...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「だの」 which typically lists items with a negative or exasperated nuance, 「も〜ば〜も〜」 lists
      multiple situations or conditions that occur, emphasizing variety or a range of possibilities without
      inherently implying the speaker's dissatisfaction or criticism. It can be used for neutral or even
      positive observations.
    grammar_point: 〜も〜ば〜も〜 (sometimes this・sometimes that)
  - term: わ〜わ
    meaning: And... and..., Keeps ...ing, So much/many, One after another, Listing various reasons/events
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「だの」 lists individual items, often with a dismissive or annoyed tone towards each, 「わ〜わ」
      emphasizes a multitude of factors or events, often leading to a sense of being overwhelmed or exasperated
      by the sheer volume or succession of things. It highlights the cumulative impact rather than the
      individual negative quality of each item.
    grammar_point: わ〜わ (overwhelming or cumulative listing)
  - term: って
    meaning: Used to quote information; also to state a reason or mark a topic.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「って」 is a highly versatile and casual particle that can be used for quoting or listing in
      a very general, neutral way. Unlike 「だの」, it carries no inherent nuance of dissatisfaction, annoyance,
      or dismissal towards the listed items; it simply presents them as given or spoken.
    grammar_point: って (casual quotation・reason・topic)
post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  To distinguish these, remember that 「だの」 is typically employed when the speaker is exasperated, annoyed, or dismissive of the items being listed. It highlights that the examples are undesirable or that the speaker is fed up with them. In contrast, 「など」 is neutral and formal, simply indicating 'and so on.' 「とか」 is casual but also generally neutral, often used to give examples in a vague or non-exhaustive way. 「～たり～たりする」, on the other hand, is used specifically for listing actions or states, and it does not carry the negative emotional weight of 「だの」.

  Furthermore, 「も〜ば〜も〜」 expresses a range of possibilities or alternating situations in a neutral manner, lacking the negative judgment inherent in 「だの」. 「わ〜わ」 emphasizes the overwhelming nature or cumulative effect of multiple things, leading to exasperation from quantity rather than the individual items' undesirability. Lastly, 「って」 is a general casual quotation or topic marker that simply presents information without any attached emotional nuance of dissatisfaction, unlike 「だの」.

    nuance: The phrase 「文句ばかり言ってしまう」 (ending up only complaining) emphasizes the speaker's involuntary
      complaints about the unpleasant summer weather. The male speaker's exasperation with the heat and
      humidity is highlighted by the listing of these specific negative aspects, 「暑いだの」 and 「蒸し暑いだの」,
      which are typical sources of complaint conveyed through 「だの」.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「だの」 is used to convey a speaker's weariness, annoyance,
  or dismissiveness towards a list of items, complaints, or excuses. Whether it's about a person's behavior,
  a situation, or a set of reasons, 「だの」 signals that the speaker is fed up with what is being listed.
