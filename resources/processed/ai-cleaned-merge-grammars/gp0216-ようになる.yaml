    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ようになる」 indicates a change or transition to a certain state or ability. It expresses that someone has \"reached the point where\" something can or cannot be done. It's often translated as \"to become able to,\" \"to come to be that,\" or \"to turn into.\"\n\n*   It is usually attached to the potential form of a verb to indicate gaining the ability to do something. For example, 「泳げるようになりました」 means \"I became able to swim\".\n*   It can also be attached to the negative form of a verb to indicate losing the ability to do something. For example, 「お酒を飲まないようになりました」 means \"I stopped drinking alcohol\" or \"I came to the point where I don't drink alcohol\".\n*   「する」 verbs do not have a potential form, so 「できる」 is used instead.",
