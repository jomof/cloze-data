        "grammatical-role": "Acts as an auxiliary verb phrase, modifying the preceding verb to denote a change in state or ability."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ようになる」 is formed from the noun 「よう」 (yō), derived from 「様」 (sama/yō), meaning 'manner' or 'way', combined with the particle 「に」 (ni), indicating a resultant state or direction, and the verb 「なる」 (naru), meaning 'to become'. Thus, it literally means 'to become in such a way' or 'to become in a state of doing X', evolving to denote a gradual transition or the acquisition of a new state or ability.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ようになる」 signifies a natural or gradual transition into a new state, habit, or ability. It conveys that a particular action or condition has 'reached the point where' it can or cannot be done, or that one has 'come to be able to' or 'come to not do' something. This construction implies an organic change over time, rather than a deliberate decision or effort. For example, 「日本語 が 話せる ようになる」 means 'to become able to speak Japanese' (implying a learning process).\n\nIt is typically attached to the plain, non-past form of a verb. When expressing an acquired ability, the potential form of the verb is used (e.g., 泳げるようになる - 'to become able to swim'). Conversely, when indicating that one has stopped doing something or lost an ability, the negative plain form is used (e.g., お酒 を 飲まない ようになる - 'to come to not drink alcohol anymore').\n\nA notable point is with `suru` verbs. Since `suru` verbs do not typically have a separate potential form, `できる` is used in conjunction with them. For instance, instead of `勉強するようになる`, it becomes `勉強 できる ようになる` ('to become able to study').\n\nWhile 「ようになる」 often implies a gradual change, it can also describe a sudden shift in state when combined with adverbs like 急に (kyū ni, 'suddenly'), as long as the change is a natural outcome rather than an intentional act.",
