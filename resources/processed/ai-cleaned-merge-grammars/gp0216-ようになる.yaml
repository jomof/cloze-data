    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ようになる」 is derived from 「よう」 (way, manner) + 「に」 (particle indicating state) + 「なる」 (to become). Thus, it literally means 'to become in the manner of,' indicating a change towards a particular state or ability.",
    "writeup": "「ようになる」 indicates a change in state, habit, or ability, translating to \"to reach the point that,\" \"to come to be that,\" or \"to turn into.\" It signifies that a certain condition or action has become possible or has become a regular occurrence. This grammar point is often used to describe a gradual change or the acquisition of a new skill.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n*   It's used with the potential form of verbs to express gaining the ability to do something. For example, 「泳げるようになる」 means \"to become able to swim.\"\n*   It can also be used with the negative form of verbs to express ceasing to do something. For example, 「お酒を飲まないようになった」 means \"to have stopped drinking alcohol.\"\n*   The nuance is that the change is often gradual, but not always. It can also describe a sudden change.\n*   する verbs often take the form 「できる」 instead of a potential form.\n\n",
