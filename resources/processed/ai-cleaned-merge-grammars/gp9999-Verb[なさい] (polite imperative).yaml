details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: meirei-kei no teineigo (polite imperative)
  usage-context: Used by a speaker in a position of authority or care (e.g., parent to child, teacher
    to student, superior to subordinate) when giving a polite command or instruction. It is softer than
    a direct plain imperative but firmer than a request using ～てください.
  function: To express a polite but firm command or instruction.
  nuance: Implies the speaker has the right or responsibility to tell the listener what to do, but in
    a polite or instructional manner. It is milder than a plain imperative but more demanding than a simple
    request. Can sound pushy or condescending if used inappropriately between equals or to superiors.
  colocation: Always immediately follows the masu-stem of a verb.
  grammatical-role: Forms a polite imperative clause, functioning as the main verb's command.
  temporal-flow: Directly indicates an action to be performed in the present or immediate future.
  spatial-flow: Not directly applicable, but can imply movement towards an action or state.
etymology: The grammar point 「なさい」 originates from the honorific verb 「なさる」 (to do), which itself is derived
  from 「なす」 (為す - to do). The imperative form of 「なさる」 is 「なされ」. Over time, 「なされ」 evolved phonetically
  into 「なさい」, establishing its function as a polite yet directive command form. This evolution highlights
  its inherent politeness while retaining its core meaning of 'do' or 'perform'.
writeup: |-
  The expression 「なさい」 is a polite imperative form used to give commands or instructions. It attaches to the masu-stem of verbs. While polite, it carries a degree of authority or expectation, making it most commonly used by speakers in a position of superior status or care, such as a parent to a child, a teacher to a student, or a boss to an employee.

  It is generally **not appropriate** to use 「なさい」 when speaking to someone of equal or higher status, as it can sound condescending or rude. For interactions with peers or superiors, 「〜てください」 is the more common and appropriate polite request form.

  Think of 「なさい」 as 'do this, please' or 'you should do this', conveying a gentle but firm instruction. It's milder than the plain imperative (e.g., 「〜ろ」, 「〜え」) which can sound very strong or aggressive, but it is more direct than simply asking with 「〜てください」.
false_friends:
  - term: 〜なさい (prohibitive)
    meaning: Don't do (archaic/emphatic prohibition)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: This archaic 「〜なさい」 means 'don't do' and is a negative command. It is formed from the prohibitive
      particle 「な」 and the suffix 「さい」, and is distinct in meaning and origin from the polite imperative
      「なさい」 meaning 'do'. The prohibitive form is rarely used in modern Japanese.
    grammar_point: な (prohibitive particle)
  - term: 〜てください
    meaning: Please do (polite request)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「なさい」 is a polite command, used when the speaker is instructing or guiding the listener, often
      from a position of authority. 「〜てください」 is a polite request, giving the listener more agency and
      is appropriate for asking peers or superiors.
    grammar_point: てください (polite request)
  - term: 命令形 (plain imperative)
    meaning: Do! (direct command)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The plain imperative (e.g., 「〜ろ」, 「〜え」) is a very strong and direct command, often sounding
      harsh. 「なさい」 softens this directness with politeness, making it suitable for instructional settings,
      especially towards children or subordinates.
    grammar_point: 命令形 (imperative form)
post_false_friends_writeup: It's crucial to distinguish between the positive command 「なさい」 (do politely)
  and the rare prohibitive 「なさい」 (don't do). While they share the same sound, their origins and meanings
  are entirely different. The prohibitive form is nearly obsolete in everyday conversation, typically
  replaced by 「〜するな」. When choosing between 「なさい」 and 「〜てください」, consider the power dynamic and the desired
  level of directness in your instruction.
