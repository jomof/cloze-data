    "etymology": "The grammar point 「には当たらない」 is derived from 「当たる(ataru)」, which means \"to hit the mark\" or \"to be correct\". The 「に」 particle indicates purpose or direction, and 「は」 is a contrastive particle. Therefore, literally, it suggests that something \"does not hit the mark\" in terms of appropriateness or necessity.",
    "writeup": "「には当たらない」 is a somewhat formal pattern used to indicate that something is \"not worth (A)\", or that there is \"no need to (A)\". It combines the case marking particle 「に」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and the negative form of the う-Verb 「当たる」 (\"to strike\", or \"to be on the mark\"), 「当たらない」. Thus, the literal meaning can be thought of as \"it's not on the mark to (A)\".\n\n「には当たらない」 appears directly after verbs in their dictionary form, or after 「する」 verbs with or without the 「する」. The 「は」 may occasionally be omitted without changing the meaning.\n\nRather than implying that something is \"way off\", 「には当たらない」 most often highlights that a particular situation is not to the extent where (A) would be appropriate. (A) itself is regularly a verb that relates to reactions or feelings. Some examples include 「驚く」 (\"to be surprised\"), 「非難」 (\"to reproach\"), 「称賛」 (\"to admire\"), 「感心」 (\"to be impressed\"), 「喜ぶ」 (\"to rejoice\"), and other similar words.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While 『～必要はない』 expresses a simple lack of necessity, 『には当たらない』 implies that a situation does not meet the standard or criteria to warrant a particular action or reaction. 『には当たらない』 often carries a more formal or evaluative tone, suggesting an inappropriateness rather than just a lack of need."

            "term": "～に値しない",
            "meaning": "not worth (doing/having)",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "『～に値しない』 (not worth) is a stronger, more direct negative judgment about the inherent value of something. In contrast, 『には当たらない』 suggests that something doesn't reach the level where a certain action or reaction is appropriate, often implying that while it might not be 'worthless', it's not significant enough to justify the response."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「～必要はない」 and 「～に値しない」 might seem similar in meaning, 「には当たらない」 has a nuanced emphasis on something not meeting a certain standard or criterion for a reaction. It implies that a situation is not significant enough to warrant a particular action or feeling. For instance, you might say 「心配 する 必要 は ない」 (no need to worry) in a simple reassuring way, but 「心配 する {には 当たらない}」 carries a more formal or evaluative tone, suggesting that the situation objectively doesn't call for worry.",

            "etymology": "「感謝 (かんしゃ)」 means 'gratitude' or 'thanks'. This example shows how the grammar point can be used with abstract concepts like emotions or actions, indicating that even such feelings or acts are not 'on the mark' or appropriate for the situation."

            "etymology": "「犯罪 (はんざい)」 means 'crime'. In a legal context, using 「には当たらない」 clarifies that an action does not meet the precise criteria to be classified as a crime, even if it might be morally or ethically dubious. This usage shows the exactness this grammar point can convey."

            "etymology": "「心配 (しんぱい)」 means 'worry' or 'anxiety'. The nuance of 「心配 する には 当たりません」 is that the situation does not reach the threshold that would objectively justify worrying, especially when a capable person is handling it."

            "etymology": "The use of the past tense 「当たらなかった」 here signifies that in hindsight, a past event did not meet the conditions to elicit a particular reaction (surprise). It implies a retrospective evaluation of appropriateness."
