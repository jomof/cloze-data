    "etymology": "The grammar point 「には当たらない」 is derived from 「当たる(ataru)」, which means \"to hit the mark\" or \"to be correct\". The 「に」 particle indicates purpose or direction, and 「は」 is a contrastive particle. Therefore, literally, it suggests that something \"does not hit the mark\" in terms of appropriateness or necessity.",
    "writeup": "「には当たらない」 is a somewhat formal pattern used to indicate that something is \"not worth (A)\", or that there is \"no need to (A)\". It combines the case marking particle 「に」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and the negative form of the う-Verb 「当たる」 (\"to strike\", or \"to be on the mark\"), 「当たらない」. Thus, the literal meaning can be thought of as \"it's not on the mark to (A)\".\n\n「には当たらない」 appears directly after verbs in their dictionary form, or after 「する」 verbs with or without the 「する」. The 「は」 may occasionally be omitted without changing the meaning.\n\nRather than implying that something is \"way off\", 「には当たらない」 most often highlights that a particular situation is not to the extent where (A) would be appropriate. (A) itself is regularly a verb that relates to reactions or feelings. Some examples include 「驚く」 (\"to be surprised\"), 「非難」 (\"to reproach\"), 「称賛」 (\"to admire\"), 「感心」 (\"to be impressed\"), 「喜ぶ」 (\"to rejoice\"), and other similar words.",
