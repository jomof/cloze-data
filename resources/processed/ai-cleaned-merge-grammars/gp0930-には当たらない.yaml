    "etymology": "The grammar point 「には当たらない」 comes from 「当たる」 (ataru), meaning \"to hit,\" \"to be right,\" or \"to correspond.\" In this context, 「当たる」 implies that a certain action or feeling is fitting or appropriate. The negative form 「当たらない」 means it's not fitting or appropriate. Adding 「には」 emphasizes that the action or feeling in question is not warranted.",
    "writeup": "「には当たらない」is a somewhat formal pattern used to express that something is \"not worth (A)\" or that there is \"no need to (A).\" It combines the case-marking particle 「に」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and the negative form of the う-Verb 「当たる」, which means \"to strike\" or \"to be on the mark\" in other contexts. Therefore, a literal translation might be \"it's not on the mark to (A).\" \n\n「には当たらない」 appears directly after verbs in their dictionary form. For する verbs, the 「する」can be present or omitted. The 「は」 may occasionally be omitted, but this does not change the meaning.\n\nRather than implying something is completely wrong, 「には当たらない」 often highlights that a particular situation doesn't warrant a specific reaction or action. (A) often relates to reactions or feelings such as 「驚く」 (\"to be surprised\"), 「非難」 (\"to criticize\"), 「称賛」 (\"to admire\"), 「感心」 (\"to be impressed\"), 「喜ぶ」 (\"to rejoice\"), and other similar verbs.",
