    "etymology": "大体 (だいたい) is formed from the kanji 大 (だい), meaning \"large\" or \"great,\" and 体 (たい), meaning \"body\" or \"substance.\" Together, they suggest the main or essential part of something, which leads to its various meanings.",
    "writeup": "**大体 (だいたい)** is an adverb with several nuances, all revolving around the idea of the 'main point' or 'essence' of something. It can mean \"mostly,\" \"generally,\" or \"for the most part,\" highlighting an approximate quantity or degree. It can modify entire phrases or appear before a noun as **大体の + noun**. Similar to **そもそも (in the first place)**, 大体 can also carry this meaning, often when expressing a situation where a desired outcome did not occur. The core idea is expressing something in its essential or unaltered form.",
