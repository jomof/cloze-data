    "writeup": "**だいたい (daitai)** functions as an adverb in Japanese, primarily indicating the \"main point\" or \"essence\" of something, leading to various nuances. It is commonly translated as \"mostly,\" \"generally,\" or \"for the most part,\" conveying an approximate quantity, degree, or typicality. This grammar point can modify entire phrases or be used directly before a noun in the form of **大体の + noun**.\n\nFurthermore, だいたい can also convey the meaning of \"in the first place,\" similar to **そもそも (somosomo)**. This nuance is often evident when the surrounding sentence implies a desired outcome that unfortunately did not occur, or when questioning the fundamental premise of a situation. For example, when used in an exasperated tone, it can imply a strong ",
