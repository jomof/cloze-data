    "etymology": "This grammar point is composed of the te-form of a verb, followed by the verb 「もらう」 (morau), which means \"to receive.\" The combination indicates receiving the *action* of the verb. So 「買ってもらう」 (katte morau) means \"to receive the action of buying,\" or \"to have someone buy (for me).\"",
    "writeup": "「てもらう」 focuses on **receiving** an action. Unlike 「てくれる」, it doesn't emphasize the \"bestowal\" aspect, but rather highlights that someone did something for you. The person performing the action is marked with 「に」, while the receiver is marked with 「は」 or 「が」. This structure often translates to \"to have (someone) do (A) for you\" or \"to get (someone) to do (A)\".\n\nWhen receiving services from someone, 「てもらう」 is generally preferred over 「てくれる」, as the latter implies the action was a personal favor.",
