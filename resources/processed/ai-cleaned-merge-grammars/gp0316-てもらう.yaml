    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てもらう」 is composed of 「て」-form of a verb and 「もらう」 (morau), which means \"to receive.\" Therefore, literally it means \"to receive the action of doing something.\"",
    "writeup": "「てもらう」 is used to express receiving an action from someone. It's similar to 「てくれる」, but 「てもらう」 focuses more on the act of receiving rather than the giver's favor.　With 「てもらう」, the person performing the action is marked with 「に」, and the receiver is marked with 「が」 or 「は」.　The English translations include \"to have (someone) do (A) for you\" or \"to get (someone) to do (A) for you\". Unlike 「てくれる」, using 「てもらう」 to receive a service from someone is more appropriate because 「てくれる」 implies the action was a favor.",
