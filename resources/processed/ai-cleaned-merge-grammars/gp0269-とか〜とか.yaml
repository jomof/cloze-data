    "writeup": "The structure 「とか〜とか」 is used to present a **non-exhaustive list** of items or actions. It implies that the listed elements are merely examples from a broader category, suggesting the existence of other similar items. It can follow nouns, verbs, or even clauses. When multiple items are listed, the final 「とか」 is frequently omitted.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **Non-Exhaustive:** The core meaning of 「とか」 is to indicate that the list provided is not complete; there are other unmentioned items or actions that could also fit. The speaker is just providing a few characteristic examples.\n*   **Versatility:** Unlike some other listing particles, 「とか」 is highly versatile. It can connect not only nouns but also verbs and entire clauses, which expands its utility significantly in conversational Japanese.\n*   **Casual Tone:** While technically usable in formal contexts, 「とか」 generally carries a casual or conversational nuance. It's frequently heard in daily interactions where a precise or exhaustive enumeration is not necessary or desired.",
