    "writeup": "「とか」is a listing particle used to list examples in a non-exhaustive way. This means the listener assumes there are other items not explicitly mentioned. It is used to provide a few examples from a potentially larger category.\n\n「とか」 can be used with nouns or verbs.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   When listing multiple items, the final 「とか」 is often omitted.\n*   「とか」 is used for non-exhaustive lists. Don't use it if you intend to list every single item.",
