    "etymology": "「とか」 is derived from the particle 「と」 (to), which indicates a listing of items, and 「か」 (ka), which adds uncertainty or acts as a question marker, giving the sense of \"and so on\" or \"among other things.\"",
    "writeup": "The structure 「とか〜とか」 is used to present a **non-exhaustive list** of items or actions. It implies that the listed elements are merely examples from a broader category, suggesting the existence of other similar items. It can follow nouns, verbs, or even clauses. When multiple items are listed, the final 「とか」 is frequently omitted. A key distinction from the particle 「や」 is that 「とか」 can connect verbs, whereas 「や」 is restricted to nouns.",
