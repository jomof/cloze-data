  usage-context: 一般
etymology: だけに is composed of だけ (dake), meaning "only" or "just," and に (ni), a particle that can indicate
  reason or cause. The combination emphasizes that something is particularly true or noteworthy because
  of a specific reason or condition.
writeup: だけに is a grammar pattern that often translates to "as might be expected of (A)," "it's only natural
  due to (A)," or simply "because of (A)." It combines だけ, meaning "just," and に, a particle indicating
  reason. The literal sense is "just in that it's (A)," drawing the listener's attention to (A) to show
  that (B) is noteworthy because of it. It can highlight either positive or negative results due to (A)
  and appears after verbs, い-adjectives (followed by な), or nouns. だけに emphasizes that (B) is a level
  above what's usually expected because of (A). This can relate to difficulty, emotional reaction, volume,
  or anything quantifiable. In essence, it underscores that (B) is remarkable specifically due to (A).
false_friends:
  - term: わけだ
    meaning: for that reason, no wonder, as you'd expect, naturally, thus, this is why
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「だけに」, which emphasizes a natural or heightened consequence due to a specific factor,
      「わけだ」 explains a logical conclusion or a realization based on observed information, often akin to
      'no wonder' or 'that means'.
    grammar_point: わけだ (logical conclusion)
  - term: だけあって
    meaning: is only natural, …being the case, because, as might be expected
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「だけに」 highlights an outcome as a natural and often heightened consequence of a given
      condition, 「だけあって」 specifically implies that the result is justified or lives up to the reputation
      of the preceding condition, affirming its quality or worth.
    grammar_point: だけあって (justified outcome)
  - term: だけのことはある
    meaning: no wonder, not surprising that, as expected
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「だけに」 focuses on the naturalness and expected intensity of an outcome given a cause. In contrast,
      「だけのことはある」 emphasizes that the result successfully justifies the effort, cost, or reputation involved,
      indicating that it was 'worth it'.
    grammar_point: だけのことはある (as expected)
  - term: だからこそ
    meaning: Precisely because, that's why, for that very reason
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「だけに」, which indicates an expected or heightened outcome due to a natural consequence,
      「だからこそ」 emphasizes the cause as the unique or singularly critical reason for the result, often implying
      that the result would not have happened otherwise or is particularly strong due to this specific
      reason.
    grammar_point: からこそ (emphasized reason)
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions all touch upon cause and effect, their precise nuances
  differentiate them. 「だけに」 emphasizes that a particular outcome or characteristic is a natural and expected,
  and often heightened, consequence of a specific preceding factor. It highlights the direct and logical
  link between cause and effect, suggesting an inevitability or amplification of the result. In contrast,
  「わけだ」 is used to present a logical conclusion or a realization, explaining 'why' something is the case
  based on prior information or observation. It often translates to 'no wonder' or 'that means.' 「だけあって」
  implies that an outcome is justified because the preceding condition lived up to its inherent qualities
  or reputation. It's about validating an expectation of quality or performance. 「だけのことはある」 conveys that
  a result proves to be worthwhile, often justifying the effort, expense, or reputation associated with
  it. It suggests that the outcome provides a sufficient return on investment or meets high expectations.
  Finally, 「だからこそ」 points to a cause as the exclusive or most significant reason for an outcome, often
  implying that the result hinges critically on this unique factor and might not occur without it.
examples:
  - english: My friend has lived in Japan for a long time, so it's natural they also understand dialects
      well.
    japanese:
      - 私 の 友達 は 日本 で 長く 暮らし て いる {だけ に}、方言 も よく わかる。
      - 私 の 友達 は 日本 で 長く 暮らし て いる {だけ に}、方言 も よく わかり ます。

          - 私 の 友達 は 日本 で 長く 暮らし て いる {の で}、方言 も よく わかる。
        english: My friend lives in Japan for a long time, so they also understand dialects well.
        hint: While 「ので」 states a reason, 「だけに」 adds the nuance that the outcome is an expected and natural
          consequence of the preceding condition. We're looking for an expression that emphasizes this
          natural expectation.
    scene: Two male friends are discussing a mutual acquaintance's deep understanding of Japanese culture
      beyond standard Japanese.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The informal tone and the use of 「わかる」 (understand) in the casual register reflect everyday
      conversation. 「方言」 (dialect) is a natural topic when someone has lived in Japan for an extended
      period, implying a depth of understanding expected from their experience. The use of 「だけに」 emphasizes
      that this understanding is a natural consequence of their long residency, making it an expected
      outcome.
    etymology: The concept of 'long residency' (長く暮らし て いる) naturally leads to a deep understanding, which
      is why the use of だけに feels appropriate here.

        hint: 「ので」 states a simple cause-and-effect. 「だけに」 emphasizes that the restaurant's location naturally
          leads to it being fully booked, making it an expected outcome. We're looking for an expression
          that conveys this natural expectation.
    scene: Two women trying to get a reservation at a popular restaurant.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The polite form 「です」 at the end of the sentence is appropriate for a semi-formal context.
      Being 「駅前 に ある」 (located in front of the station) suggests high demand, making 「予約 で いっぱい」 (fully
      booked) a natural and expected outcome. 「だけに」 here highlights that the high demand is an expected
      outcome due to its location.

        english: Because the scenery there is beautiful, many tourists gather.

          reason, the natural and expected cause, for many tourists gathering. We're looking for an expression
          that emphasizes this inherent connection.
    scene: A local explaining the popularity of a scenic spot to a visitor.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: The adjective 「きれい」 (beautiful) is modified by 「な」 to connect with 「だけに」, clearly showing
      that the beauty of the scenery is the direct and expected reason for the large number of tourists.
      This example demonstrates the 「な-adjective + な + だけに」 formation. The casual register fits a friendly
      conversation.

    scene: A tech reviewer discussing the immense popularity and quick sell-out of a new device.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The phrase 「機能 が 優れ て いる」 (excellent features) directly explains why the smartphone would
      quickly sell out, leading to the expected outcome of 「品切れ に なっ た」 (sold out). This is an objective
      observation typical in an informative context. 「だけに」 underscores that the sell-out is a direct,
      unsurprising consequence of its superior quality.

    nuance: The fact that the department store was 「セール 中」 (on sale) is a clear reason for the 「すごい 混雑」
      (terrible crowdedness), which is an expected outcome. The casual tone and slightly negative reflection
      fit the context of discussing a frustrating experience. 「だけに」 emphasizes that the crowding was a
      natural and expected result of the sale.
