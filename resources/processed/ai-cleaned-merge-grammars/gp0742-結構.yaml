        "Register": "Informal, conversational.",
        "Usage": "Used to express that something is more than expected or satisfactory. Often implies a positive assessment but can be used in negative contexts as well to indicate an unexpectedly large degree.",

    "writeup": "**結構 (kekkou)** is an adverbial expression used to indicate that something is “quite”, “rather”, or “pretty” good, large, or significant. It often carries a nuance of exceeding expectations. It's important to note that while versatile, 結構 is generally used in conversational settings rather than formal writing. While often positive, it can be used in negative statements to express an unexpectedly high degree of something undesirable.\n\nEtymologically, 結構 has broader meanings, but in this usage, it functions specifically as an adverb of degree.",
    "etymology": "The word 結構 (kekkou) originally comes from Buddhist terminology, meaning a well-constructed or complete state. It evolved to encompass meanings like \"splendid\" or \"sufficient.\" In modern Japanese, it's used in various contexts, including to decline offers politely (\"No, thank you\") and as an adverb meaning \"quite\" or \"rather,\" retaining the nuance of something being complete or satisfactory to a degree.",
