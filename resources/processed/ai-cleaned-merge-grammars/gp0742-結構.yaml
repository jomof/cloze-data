    },
    "etymology": "The word 結構 (kekkou) originally comes from Buddhist terminology, meaning a well-constructed or complete state. It evolved to encompass meanings like \"splendid\" or \"sufficient.\" In modern Japanese, it's used in various contexts, including to decline offers politely (\"No, thank you\") and as an adverb meaning \"quite\" or \"rather,\" retaining the nuance of something being complete or satisfactory to a degree.",
    "writeup": "**結構 (kekkou)** is an adverbial expression used to indicate that something is “quite”, “rather”, or “pretty” good, large, or significant. It often carries a nuance of exceeding expectations. It's important to note that while versatile, 結構 is generally used in conversational settings rather than formal writing. While often positive, it can be used in negative statements to express an unexpectedly high degree of something undesirable.",

            "nuance": "While 結構 can sometimes mean \"okay\" when declining something (\"No, thank you\"), 大丈夫 is a much broader term for general okayness, safety, or being problem-free."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that 結構 emphasizes the degree to which something exceeds expectations. If you want to simply express that something is “okay” or “fine,” use 大丈夫. For expressing strong admiration, 素晴らしい is more appropriate. When indicating a considerable degree without the nuance of exceeding expectations, かなり is a suitable alternative.",

It's often used when clarifying information or giving advice. While 「です」 makes the sentence polite, 「よ」 provides a certain assertiveness or confidence in the statement. The usage of 「～ですよ」 often conveys that the speaker is sharing information they believe is important or helpful for the listener to know. In this context, it adds a layer of persuasive but polite communication. The combination of 「～んです」 for explanation and 「～ですよ」 for emphasis is a common way for an older, experienced person to convey information to a younger individual, regardless of gender. This combination can create a sense of mentorship or guidance in conversation, making it effective for explaining realities. The speaker is not just stating a fact but also inviting the listener to understand the depth of the situation, especially when contrasted with the initial perception of the job as ",
