        "Register": "Informal, conversational.",

        "Part of Speech": "Adverb (used mainly in conversation)"
    },
    "etymology": "The word 結構 (kekkou) originally comes from Buddhist terminology, meaning a well-constructed or complete state. It evolved to encompass meanings like \"splendid\" or \"sufficient.\" In modern Japanese, it's used in various contexts, including to decline offers politely (\"No, thank you\") and as an adverb meaning \"quite\" or \"rather,\" retaining the nuance of something being complete or satisfactory to a degree.",
    "writeup": "**結構 (kekkou)** is an adverbial expression used to indicate that something is “quite”, “rather”, or “pretty” good, large, or significant. It often carries a nuance of exceeding expectations. It's important to note that while versatile, 結構 is generally used in conversational settings rather than formal writing. While often positive, it can be used in negative statements to express an unexpectedly high degree of something undesirable.",

            "nuance": "「よ」 is a particle used to inform the listener of something new or to emphasize the speaker's statement, making it suitable for recommendations. The use of 「絵は普通」 sets up the expectation for 結構's nuance of exceeding expectations."
