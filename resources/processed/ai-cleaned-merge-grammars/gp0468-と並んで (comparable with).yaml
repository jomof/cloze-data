details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: This expression is used in formal or literary contexts, conveying a somewhat stiff or
    rigid tone.
  function: to express comparability or equivalence between two entities.
  nuance: Implies a high degree of equivalence or being on par, often in terms of quality, status, or
    popularity. It suggests that the two items stand side-by-side in importance or characteristic.
  colocation: Often used with words signifying high quality, status, or importance (e.g., 傑作 (kessaku
    - masterpiece), 古典 (koten - classic), 象徴 (shouchou - symbol)).
  grammatical-role: Functions adverbially when used in the te-form (並んで) or as an attributive clause when
    used in the plain form (並ぶ) followed by a noun or ほど.
  logical-flow: Establishes a relationship of equivalence, suggesting that two distinct entities share
    a similar level of quality, value, or characteristic.
  temporal-flow: Can describe a present state of comparability or a past achievement of comparable status.
etymology: This grammar point comes from the verb 並ぶ (narabu), meaning "to line up" or "to stand in a
  row." The use of 「と」 here indicates comparison or togetherness, so 「と 並んで」 literally means "lined up
  with" or "standing alongside," and thus it has come to mean "comparable to" or "alongside." Historically,
  this expression evolved from simply describing physical arrangement to conveying abstract equivalence,
  implying that two items are positioned side-by-side in terms of quality or significance, just as they
  would be in a physical line.
writeup: |-
  「と 並んで」 (to narande) is a grammatical construction often used to express that something is comparable to, or on par with, something else. It signifies that two entities stand at an equivalent level in terms of quality, popularity, achievement, or any other attribute. It is derived from the verb 並ぶ (narabu), meaning "to line up" or "to stand in a row," and the particle と (to) indicating association or comparison.

  While typically found in its te-form, 「並んで」, the plain form 「並ぶ」 can also be used, particularly when followed by ほど (hodo), to emphasize the *degree* to which something is comparable. For instance, 「A は B と 並ぶ ほど C だ」 conveys that "A is C to the extent that it's comparable to B." This construction is generally considered a relatively formal expression, often described as 「硬い」 (katai), meaning stiff or rigid in usage. It is frequently encountered in academic papers, news reports, and formal speeches when discussing rankings, achievements, or significant qualities of items, people, or phenomena. It subtly implies a high degree of equivalence, often placing the subject on a recognized or esteemed level alongside the item it's being compared to.

  - term: に沿って
    meaning: Along, in accordance with, in line with
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に沿って」 (ni sotte) implies following a specific path, rule, or guideline, focusing on adherence
      or physical alignment. In contrast, 「と 並んで」 (to narande) emphasizes comparability or being on an
      equal level, without necessarily implying a linear path or rule-following. It's about standing *alongside*
      in status, not *following* a guideline or physical line.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:に沿って (according to・along)
  - term: と共に
    meaning: Together with, At the same time, As well as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「と共に」 (to tomo ni) emphasizes companionship, simultaneity, or joint action. While it can suggest
      an accompanying element, its primary focus is on togetherness or coexistence. 「と 並んで」 (to narande)
      specifically focuses on the *level* or *status* of comparison, implying parity rather than mere
      accompaniment or shared experience. It's about being *equal in standing*, not just *at the same
      time* or *with* someone/something else.
    grammar_point: と共に (together with)
  - term: に伴って・に伴い
    meaning: As, Due, Along with, Hand-in-hand with, Resulted in, Be consequent upon
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に伴って」 (ni tomonatte) indicates a cause-and-effect relationship, a natural consequence, or
      something that happens *as a result of* or *along with* another event or change. This implies a
      temporal or logical connection. 「と 並んで」 (to narande), however, is purely about equivalence or being
      on par, without necessarily implying any causal or temporal dependency. It describes a *state* of
      equality, not a *process* or *consequence*.
    grammar_point: に伴って・に伴い (along with・as a result of)
  - term: のような
    meaning: Like, similar to, resembling
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「のような」 (no yō na) indicates similarity or resemblance, suggesting something *looks* or *is
      like* something else, which may or may not be true parity. 「と 並んで」, however, implies actual parity
      or being *on the same level* as something else, often in terms of quality, status, or achievement,
      rather than just superficial likeness or appearance. It asserts a shared standing.
    grammar_point: ように・ような (like・as・similar to)
  - term: に劣らない
    meaning: To be not inferior to; to be as good as; to be comparable to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に劣らない」 (ni otorana i) explicitly states that something is *not less than* something else,
      often implying it is equally good or even superior. While both express comparability, 「に劣らない」 carries
      a nuance of overcoming potential inferiority. 「と 並んで」 focuses more simply on being *alongside* or
      *on par*, highlighting an equal standing without necessarily emphasizing a challenge to a perceived
      lower status.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:に劣らない (not inferior to)
  - term: に匹敵する
    meaning: To be comparable to; to rival; to be a match for
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に匹敵する」 (ni hitteki suru) means to be a match for or to rival something, suggesting a strong
      equivalence, especially in terms of capability or scale. While very close to 「と並んで」, 匹敵する often
      implies a sense of competition or direct matching, particularly in strength, ability, or size. 「と
      並んで」 is a bit broader, focusing on co-existence at the same level of status or quality, rather than
      a direct contest.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:に匹敵する (to be comparable to)
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions might all translate to "along with" or "in line with"
  in English, their Japanese nuances differ significantly. 「と 並んで」 specifically highlights a state of
  being comparable or on par, suggesting two entities stand at an equivalent level. Avoid confusing it
  with expressions that imply physical movement along a line (に沿って), joint action or simultaneity (と共に),
  or cause and effect (に伴って). Furthermore, distinguish it from mere resemblance (のような) or the assertion
  of non-inferiority (に劣らない) or direct rivalry (に匹敵する). Focus on the core meaning of "equality in status
  or quality" when using 「と 並んで」.

      expression suitable for a formal presentation to a group. The phrase 「高級 ブランド の 製品 {と 並んで}」 highlights
      the high standard of comparison, emphasizing that the new phone is considered on par with the best,
      conveying a sense of genuine equality in terms of design quality and market standing. The use of

      when speaking to himself, showing his genuine awe at the student's level of Japanese being on par
      with a native speaker's.

post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 「と 並んで」 and 「と 並ぶ ほど」 are particularly effective when comparing
  two entities that are generally considered distinct but are being presented as having a surprisingly
  equal standing or characteristic. The choice between the te-form (並んで) and dictionary form with ほど (並ぶ
  ほど) depends on whether you want to simply state the comparability (並んで) or emphasize the degree to which
  something is comparable (並ぶ ほど). When discussing equivalence in terms of reputation, status, or an ongoing
  state of being comparable, 「と 並んで」 is suitable. When emphasizing the *extent* or *degree* to which something
  is comparable, often highlighting a surprising achievement or magnitude, 「と 並ぶ ほど」 is the more appropriate
  choice.
