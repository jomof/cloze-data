formation:
  Noun + によって: Indicates the cause or reason for an event or situation.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The expressions 「によって」, 「による」, and 「により」 all stem from the verb 「よる」. This verb carries meanings
  such as "to depend on," "to be based on," or "to come from." When used to express cause or reason, the
  particle 「に」 signifies the base, origin, or cause. Therefore, 「によって」 in this context signifies an action
  or event being "caused by" or "due to" something.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「によって」, when used to express cause or reason, indicates that the preceding noun is the direct source or origin of a subsequent event, situation, or outcome. It functions adverbially, connecting the cause to the effect. This usage is common in formal, written, or academic contexts, making it more objective and often more emphatic than simpler causal expressions like 「から」 or 「ので」.

  While 「によって」 can also indicate means, agent, or dependency in other contexts, this specific usage focuses purely on causality. It is particularly useful when the cause is a significant factor, an external force, or a systemic reason, rather than a personal or immediate one.

post_false_friends_writeup: To effectively distinguish between these expressions, consider the precise
  relationship you wish to convey. Use 「によって」 when the preceding noun is the cause or origin of an event.
  Choose 「ために」 for direct reasons or purposes. Reserve 「によると」 and 「によれば」 specifically for citing sources
  of information. Use 「で」 for general means, 「から」 for direct reasons, and 「せい」 when assigning blame. When
  referring to a foundation, 「にもとづいて」 might be used, whereas 「によって」 is for direct causation.
