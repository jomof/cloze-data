        "part-of-speech": "phrase",

    },
    "etymology": "The phrase is derived from 「そう」 (like that) and 「言えば」 (if you say). The literal sense is akin to \"if saying that,\" which implies recalling something triggered by a previous statement.",
    "writeup": "「そういえば」 is used to introduce a topic that the speaker has just remembered or thought of, often prompted by something previously mentioned in the conversation. It's similar to saying \"speaking of which,\" \"by the way,\" or \"come to think of it\" in English.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n*   「そういえば」 is used to transition to a related topic, not to introduce completely unrelated subjects. This is a subtle but important distinction from the English phrase \"by the way.\"\n*   It is very similar in usage to 「といえば」, with 「そう」 simply replacing the direct quotation particle 「と」. You can think of it as a set phrase.",
