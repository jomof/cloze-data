    },
    "etymology": "「せめて」 originates from the verb 「責める (せめる)」, meaning \"to blame\" or \"to press\". This connection, though seemingly indirect, implies that the nuance of `せめて` is about 'pressing' or 'demanding' a minimum standard. This linguistic evolution highlights how a sense of obligation, insistence, or a baseline requirement has been integrated into the adverb's meaning.",
    "writeup": "「せめて」 is an adverb that expresses the speaker's strong desire for, or expectation of, the *minimum* acceptable level of something. It is commonly translated as \"at least\". Unlike more neutral terms, 「せめて」 carries an emotional weight, often implying that while a desired ideal might be unattainable, a certain minimal condition *must* or *should* be met. This can convey a sense of urgency, plea, or slight exasperation regarding this minimum.\n\n「せめて」 typically appears at the beginning of a sentence or clause, emphasizing the crucial nature of the minimum requirement for a desired outcome. It is frequently paired with expressions of desire, opinion, or obligation, such as 「～たい」 (tai, 'want to'), 「～ほしい」 (hoshii, 'want something'), 「～てほしい」 (te-hoshii, 'want someone to do something'), and 「～べき」 (beki, 'should' or 'ought to'). Its usage highlights a speaker's personal investment in the outcome, even if it's only the bare minimum.",
