pronunciation:
  katakana: オ カエリミズ
  romaji: o kaerimizu
formation:
  Noun + を顧みず: Expresses an action performed without considering or disregarding a specific noun.
jlpt: N1
etymology: The phrase `を顧みず` is a combination of the object particle `を (o)`, the verb `顧みる (kaerimiru)`,
  and the classical negative auxiliary `ず (zu)`. The verb `顧みる` means "to look back at," "to reflect upon,"
  or "to consider." It is itself a compound of `顧る (kaeru)`, meaning "to look back," and `見る (miru)`,
  "to see." The `ず` suffix serves as an archaic negative form, equivalent to the modern `ない (nai)`. Thus,
  `顧みず` literally translates to "without looking back at" or "without considering." When combined with
  the object particle `を`, it forms the expression "without considering [object]," emphasizing the deliberate
  act of disregarding something important.
writeup: '`を顧みず` is a formal and somewhat literary expression used to convey that an action is carried
  out **without considering or disregarding** a particular noun or situation. The phrase literally means
  "without looking back at" or "without considering" the object marked by `を`. This implies a strong sense
  of **determination**, **recklessness**, or **indifference** towards the thing being disregarded, often
  with the implication that there might be negative consequences or that the action goes against common
  sense or caution. It is typically used in more formal or written contexts, such as news reports, official
  statements, or literary works, rather than everyday casual conversation. It highlights a deliberate
  choice to ignore an important factor, often when pursuing a goal or taking an action. The disregarded
  element is usually something of significance, such as safety, one''s health, public opinion, or potential
  risks.'
false_friends:
  - term: も構わず
    meaning: without worrying about, without caring about
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express disregard, `を顧みず` often implies a more deliberate and serious disregard
      for a significant factor (e.g., safety, law), suggesting a greater consequence or a more formal
      context. `も構わず` is broader and can be used for less critical things like appearances or others'
      feelings, and it feels less literary.
    grammar_point: も構わず (without worrying about)
  - term: をよそに
    meaning: ignoring, disregarding, without paying attention to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`をよそに` often suggests that an action is performed while **ignoring others'' expectations
      or general circumstances**, often with a sense of indifference or defiance. `を顧みず` implies a more
      direct, active disregard for a **specific, often critical, factor** affecting the actor. `をよそに`
      feels more about ignoring external factors; `を顧みず` is about ignoring internal considerations or
      risks.'
    grammar_point: をよそに (ignoring・disregarding)
  - term: ずに・ないで・ことなく
    meaning: without doing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: These are general negative conjunctions meaning "without doing X." `を顧みず` specifically means
      "without **considering** or **disregarding** Y," where Y is an object, emphasizing the lack of consideration
      rather than just the absence of an action. `ずに` is a common negative form, while `を顧みず` is a set
      phrase with a specific formal nuance.
    grammar_point: ずに・ないで・ことなく (without doing)
post_false_friends_writeup: While expressions like `も構わず` and `をよそに` also convey a sense of ignoring or
  not caring, `を顧みず` carries a more formal and often more serious nuance. It specifically highlights the
  act of neglecting to consider something important, often a risk, a rule, or a responsibility. In contrast,
  `も構わず` suggests a lack of concern for less critical matters like others' opinions or appearances. `をよそに`
  implies ignoring surrounding circumstances or others' reactions, often with a detached or defiant attitude.
  Understanding these subtle differences is key to using each phrase appropriately in Japanese.
