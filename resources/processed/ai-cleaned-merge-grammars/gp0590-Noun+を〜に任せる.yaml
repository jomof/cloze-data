        "register": "semi-formal",
        "usage-context": "general usage context",
        "function": "To express the act of delegating responsibility, giving discretion, or ceding control over something to another party or to external forces like luck or fate.",
        "nuance": "Implies a complete transfer of responsibility or control for a specific task or outcome. It carries a sense of confidence in the recipient or resignation to external factors."
    },
    "etymology": "任せる (makaseru) is derived from 任 (nin), meaning 'responsibility' or 'duty,' and せる (seru), the causative form suffix, indicating 'to cause to do' or 'to entrust.' Therefore, 任せる literally means 'to cause someone to take on a responsibility.' The particle を marks the object being entrusted, and に indicates the recipient of the responsibility.",
    "writeup": "The structure 「(A) を (B) に任せる」 highlights that something (A) is being \"entrusted\" or \"left up to\" (B). This is a standard function of the verb 「任せる」, a る-verb meaning \"to entrust\". In this construction, 「(A) を」 identifies the task or matter being entrusted, while 「(B) に」 identifies the person, group, or even abstract concept (like fate or luck) to whom (A) is being left. This expression is versatile; it can be used for delegating a specific task to an individual, or for resigning oneself to the outcome of a situation left to chance or destiny. It implies a transfer of full responsibility or control.",
