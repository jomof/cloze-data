    },
    "etymology": "任せる (makaseru) is derived from 任 (nin), meaning 'responsibility' or 'duty,' and せる (seru), the causative form suffix, indicating 'to cause to do' or 'to entrust.' Therefore, 任せる literally means 'to cause someone to take on a responsibility.' The particle を marks the object being entrusted, and に indicates the recipient of the responsibility.",
    "writeup": "The structure 「(A) を (B) に任せる」 highlights that something (A) is being \"entrusted\" or \"left up to\" (B). This is a standard function of the verb 「任せる」, a る-verb meaning \"to entrust\". In this construction, 「(A) を」 identifies the task or matter being entrusted, while 「(B) に」 identifies the person, group, or even abstract concept (like fate or luck) to whom (A) is being left. This expression is versatile; it can be used for delegating a specific task to an individual, or for resigning oneself to the outcome of a situation left to chance or destiny. It implies a transfer of full responsibility or control.",

            "nuance": "「〜に委ねる」 is a close synonym to 「〜に任せる」, often used in more formal or literary contexts, especially when talking about committing oneself or a large entity to a higher power or fate. 「〜に任せる」 is more common in everyday delegation."
