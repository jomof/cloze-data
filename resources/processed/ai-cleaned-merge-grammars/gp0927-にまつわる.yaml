    "writeup": "「にまつわる」 is a formal grammar point that expresses that something is broadly related to a specific topic. It's often translated as \"related to,\" \"associated with,\" or \"surrounding.\" Typically, a noun precedes 「にまつわる」, indicating the main topic, and another noun follows, representing the information or explanation connected to that topic. Words like 「話 (はなし)」 \"tale,\" 「物語 (ものがたり)」 \"story,\" 「伝説 (でんせつ)」 \"legend,\" and 「神話 (しんわ)」 \"myth\" often appear after 「にまつわる」. It shares a kanji with 「纏まる(まとまる)」 which means \"to come together\" and \"to consolidate.\"",
