    "writeup": "「にまつわる」 is a formal grammar pattern primarily used to indicate that something is related to, associated with, or surrounds a particular topic. It stems from the verb 「纏わる」(まつわる), meaning \"to coil around.\" This grammar point is often found in formal writing or speech. Typically, it connects two nouns, where the first noun is the topic, and the second is the information, story, or explanation related to that topic. Words like 「話」(はなし - tale), 「物語」(ものがたり - story), 「伝説」(でんせつ - legend), and 「神話」(しんわ - myth) frequently appear after 「にまつわる」 because the grammar point often introduces narratives or explanations related to a central subject.",
