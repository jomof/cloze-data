        "part-of-speech": "adverb",
        "register": "semi-formal",
        "function": "It expresses a strong subjective feeling or impression about something, emphasizing that a situation, characteristic, or appearance is precisely as one would expect or as described. It lends a sense of conviction to the statement.",
        "nuance": "「いかにも」 often implies that something is exactly as one would anticipate based on common criteria, stereotypes, or preconceived notions. It conveys a strong sense of 'as expected' or 'quintessentially'. It can sometimes carry a subtle connotation of something being almost *too* typical or even a bit cliché."
    },
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「いかにも」 (いかにも) is debated among linguists, but it is generally understood to derive from 「如何にも」 (いかにも), an older Japanese expression meaning 'in any way' or 'by all means.' Over time, its usage evolved to emphasize the degree or manner of something, asserting that it is truly, indeed, or exactly so. The original interrogative sense of 'how' (如何, いかに) shifted to an emphatic affirmation of 'how much' or 'to what extent,' leading to its current adverbial function.",
    "writeup": "「いかにも」 is a powerful adverb used to convey a strong sense of affirmation, emphasis, or confirmation. It implies that something is **truly**, **indeed**, or **really** the way it appears or is described, often suggesting that it perfectly matches a certain expectation, stereotype, or preconceived notion. This word adds a layer of conviction to a statement, making it clear that the speaker feels the subject embodies the quality in question to a high degree. It is commonly used to emphasize a quality, characteristic, or appearance. For instance, if someone says 「いかにも学者らしい」 (ikanimo gakusha rashii), it means \"truly like a scholar,\" emphasizing that the person's appearance or behavior perfectly aligns with the stereotype of a scholar. While versatile, 「いかにも」 tends to lend a slightly formal or observational tone, making it more common in semi-formal or formal discourse. It can be used positively to commend someone's typical qualities or neutrally to describe a fitting appearance, but can also carry a slightly critical or sarcastic undertone if something is *too* typical or stereotypical in a negative way. When combined with expressions like 「〜そうだ」 (looks like), 「〜らしい」 (seems like, typical of), 「〜ようだ/様子だ」 (appears to be), or 「〜かのように」 (as if), 「いかにも」 intensifies the degree of that appearance or characteristic, confirming that it is exactly as one would expect.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While both emphasize truth, 「いかにも」 carries more of a sense of 'as expected,' 'quintessential,' or 'stereotypical,' often implying that something perfectly fits a preconceived idea. In contrast, 「本当に」 simply affirms the truth of a statement without this 'as expected' nuance, similar to 'genuinely' or 'factually'."

            "meaning": "certainly, definitely",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「確かに」 emphasizes certainty, confirmation, or acknowledgment of a fact, often with a sense of 'it is true that...' or 'indeed, you are right.' 「いかにも」, on the other hand, stresses the degree to which something is true or characteristic, highlighting that it embodies a quality or appearance precisely as one would imagine."

            "meaning": "as if, as though (implying false appearance)",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「さも」 is also an adverb meaning 'as if' or 'as though,' but it carries a strong implication that the appearance is deceptive or untrue, or that the person is acting falsely. 「いかにも」, while sometimes used with 「〜かのように」 to describe an outward appearance, typically emphasizes that the appearance is *truly* and *authentically* typical or exactly as expected, without necessarily implying deceit, unless used in a sarcastic context."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「いかにも」, 「本当に」, and 「確かに」 can all express emphasis, their nuances differ. Use 「いかにも」 when something is strikingly typical or exactly as you would expect it to be, often fitting a stereotype. Use 「本当に」 when you want to affirm the factual truth or genuineness of something. Use 「確かに」 when you are confirming a fact or acknowledging something with certainty. Additionally, distinguish 「いかにも」 from 「さも」: 「さも」 implies a deceptive or false appearance, whereas 「いかにも」 suggests an appearance that is genuinely typical or true to character (even if that 'character' is a performance, the performance itself is 'typical').",

The addition of 「いかにも」 reinforces that John's happiness is so evident and natural given the circumstances, making it a fitting comment between friends. The ending 「そうだ」 is neutral and doesn't dictate gender, but when paired with the direct observation of a peer's emotion, it is common for a younger female speaker to share with a younger male listener.",
            "etymology": "The use of 「そうだ」 to express 'looks like' or 'seems like' is a grammatical construction derived from the verb's stem form, emphasizing an appearance or sensory perception. The original meaning of 「そうだ」 relates to sounds and hearing, evolving to indicate appearance based on observation, linking to the nuance of 「いかにも」 which asserts the strong impression of something being true to its appearance."

            "etymology": "The concept of 「技」 (waza) meaning 'technique' or 'skill' is deeply rooted in Japanese craftsmanship and martial arts. Attributing a high level of 「技」 to a professional emphasizes the perfected execution, which aligns with the emphatic nature of 「いかにも」. The word 「プロ」 itself is a loanword from English 'professional', demonstrating how Japanese incorporates foreign concepts to describe specific roles and standards."

This type of observation can be made by a younger male colleague to a female colleague.",
