    "details": {
        "Register": "「いかにも」 is primarily used in formal or semi-formal speech and writing. While not strictly restricted, its usage in very casual conversation might feel slightly out of place, although it can be used for strong emphasis.",
        "Function": "It expresses a strong subjective feeling or impression about something, emphasizing that a situation, characteristic, or appearance is precisely as one would expect or as described. It lends a sense of conviction to the statement.",
        "Nuance": "「いかにも」 often implies that something is exactly as one would anticipate based on common criteria, stereotypes, or preconceived notions. It conveys a strong sense of 'as expected' or 'quintessentially'. It can sometimes carry a subtle connotation of something being almost *too* typical or even a bit cliché."
    },
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「いかにも」 (いかにも) is debated among linguists, but it is generally understood to derive from 「如何にも」 (いかにも), an older Japanese expression meaning 'in any way' or 'by all means.' Over time, its usage evolved to emphasize the degree or manner of something, asserting that it is truly, indeed, or exactly so. The original interrogative sense of 'how' (如何, いかに) shifted to an emphatic affirmation of 'how much' or 'to what extent,' leading to its current adverbial function.",
    "writeup": "「いかにも」 is a powerful adverb used to convey a strong sense of affirmation, emphasis, or confirmation. It implies that something is **truly**, **indeed**, or **really** the way it appears or is described, often suggesting that it perfectly matches a certain expectation, stereotype, or preconceived notion. This word adds a layer of conviction to a statement, making it clear that the speaker feels the subject embodies the quality in question to a high degree.\n\nIt is commonly used to emphasize a quality, characteristic, or appearance. For instance, if someone says 「いかにも学者らしい」 (ikanimo gakusha rashii), it means \"truly like a scholar,\" emphasizing that the person's appearance or behavior perfectly aligns with the stereotype of a scholar. While versatile, 「いかにも」 tends to lend a slightly formal or observational tone, making it more common in semi-formal or formal discourse. It can be used positively to commend someone's typical qualities or neutrally to describe a fitting appearance, but can also carry a slightly critical or sarcastic undertone if something is *too* typical or stereotypical in a negative way.\n\nWhen combined with expressions like 「〜そうだ」 (looks like), 「〜らしい」 (seems like, typical of), 「〜ようだ/様子だ」 (appears to be), or 「〜かのように」 (as if), 「いかにも」 intensifies the degree of that appearance or characteristic, confirming that it is exactly as one would expect.",
