pronunciation:
  katakana: ノニ
  romaji: noni
formation:

  Noun + な + のに: Despite [noun]
jlpt: N4
etymology: The particle 「のに」 originates from the nominalizing particle 「の」, which turns a preceding clause
  into a noun phrase, combined with the particle 「に」, which indicates a contrast or purpose. This construction
  evolved to express a situation where an outcome is contrary to what would be expected from the preceding
  condition or reason. The core idea is that something happens 'in relation to' (に) a prior state (の),
  but in an unexpected way.
writeup: '「のに」 expresses a sense of surprise or disappointment that the expected result did not occur.
  It conveys "despite" or "even though." The basic structure is [clause 1] + 「のに」 + [clause 2], where
  clause 2 is contrary to what would be expected from clause 1.「のに」 can also mean "in order to" when the
  result in clause 2 is a logical consequence of clause 1. However, this lesson primarily focuses on the
  "despite" nuance, which is used when clause 2 presents an illogical or unexpected outcome.For connecting
  to different word types: verbs and い-adjectives connect directly to 「のに」 using their plain form.な-adjectives
  and nouns require 「な」 before 「のに」. For example, 「静か な のに」 (despite being quiet) or 「雨 な のに」 (despite
  the rain).While you might occasionally encounter 「だ のに」, especially in certain dialects, 「な のに」 is generally
  considered the standard and correct form when connecting to な-adjectives and nouns.'

  - term: くせに
    meaning: Even though, and yet, despite
    kind: synonym

  - term: それなのに
    meaning: And yet, despite this
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「それ な の に」 is used as a conjunction to introduce a strongly contradictory result to a previously

      unexpectedness of a contrary outcome.
    grammar_point: それでも (even so)
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share similar meanings of concession or contrast,
  they have subtle differences in nuance and usage. 「の に」 is versatile for expressing unexpected outcomes
  or disappointment, while expressions like 「くせに」 carry a critical tone, and 「ながらも」 indicates simultaneous
  actions or formal contrast. Other expressions like 「それ な の に」 or 「それ で も」 might imply a stronger sense
  of indignation or persistence. Always consider the context and intended nuance to choose the most appropriate
  expression.
examples:
  - english: Even though he has a test tomorrow, he's playing games instead of studying.
    japanese:
      - 明日 テスト が ある {の に}、彼 は 勉強 を し ない で ゲーム を し て いる。
      - 明日 テスト が ある {の に}、彼 は 勉強 も せ ず に ゲーム を し て い ます。

          - 明日 テスト が ある {けれど} 彼 は 勉強 を し ない で ゲーム を し て いる。
        english: He has a test tomorrow, but he's playing games instead of studying.
        hint: 「けれど」 expresses a simple contrast or opposition between two clauses, without the strong
          sense of surprise or disappointment that 「の に」 conveys.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 テスト が ある {に も かかわら ず} 彼 は 勉強 を し ない で ゲーム を し て いる。
        english: Notwithstanding that he has a test tomorrow, he's playing games instead of studying.
        hint: 「に も かかわら ず」 conveys a strong sense of 'notwithstanding' or 'despite' and is generally more
          formal than 「の に」. We're looking for a more common, slightly more emotionally charged expression
          of unexpectedness.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 テスト が ある {もの の} 彼 は 勉強 を し ない で ゲーム を し て いる。
        english: Although he has a test tomorrow, he's playing games instead of studying.
        hint: 「もの の」 presents a contrast or qualification but often with a weaker sense of surprise or
          disappointment. It simply states a fact despite another fact, without implying strong criticism
          or unexpectedness.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 テスト が ある {に し て も} 彼 は 勉強 を し ない で ゲーム を し て いる。
        english: Even if he has a test tomorrow, he's playing games instead of studying.
        hint: 「に し て も」 typically means 'even if' or 'even assuming'. It introduces a concession where
          the second clause is still true. It doesn't carry the sense of unexpectedness or disappointment
          about a contrary outcome that 「の に」 does.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 テスト が ある {くせ に} 彼 は 勉強 を し ない で ゲーム を し て いる。
        english: He has a test tomorrow, and yet he's playing games instead of studying (implying blame/criticism).
        hint: 「くせ に」 strongly implies blame or criticism for the action taken despite the preceding condition.
          「の に」 is more neutral, focusing on the unexpectedness rather than directly blaming the subject.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 テスト が ある。{それ な の に} 彼 は 勉強 を し ない で ゲーム を し て いる。
        english: He has a test tomorrow. And yet, he's playing games instead of studying.
        hint: 「それ な の に」 is a conjunctive phrase used to introduce a strongly contradictory result to
          a preceding statement. It stands independently at the beginning of the second clause and often
          conveys a stronger sense of indignation or surprise than 「の に」, which functions as a particle
          connecting clauses.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 テスト が ある。{それ で も} 彼 は 勉強 を し ない で ゲーム を し て いる。

        hint: 「それ で も」 implies that despite a stated condition, the action or situation persists or happens

          the unexpectedness of a contrary outcome.

    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The speaker's frustration is conveyed through 「の に」, highlighting the illogical action of
      playing games despite the impending test. The use of 「彼」 is neutral, but the context implies a close
      relationship, typical for casual register.
    etymology: The phrase 「ゲーム を する」 (to play games) in Japanese is a common and direct translation, distinct
      from English where 'play' might be used for instruments or sports. In Japanese, it's a specific
      verb for playing digital games. The verb 「する」 (to do) is often used with nouns to create verbal
      phrases.

        english: This coffee is expensive and doesn't taste good.

    scene: Someone trying a fancy coffee at a cafe.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The 「高い のに」 highlights the speaker's disappointment. The high price typically leads one to
      expect good taste, so the lack of good taste is an unexpected outcome, expressed by 「の に」.

        english: She's usually quiet, but today she's really talkative.

    scene: Two friends noticing a mutual acquaintance's unusual behavior.
    register: casual
    setting: casual slang
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「静か な のに」 conveys the speaker's surprise at the sudden change in the friend's behavior.

        english: Today is Sunday. However, I still have to work.

    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: male

          or sense of inadequacy given the unexpected gap between speaking and listening skills.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 日本 語 が 話せる {けれど}、彼 の 言う こと が 全く 理解 でき ない。
        english: I can speak Japanese, but I can't understand what he's saying at all.

          - 試験 は 簡単 だっ た {けれど}、私 は 落ち て しまっ た。
        english: The exam was easy, but I failed.

          of the outcome, which 「の に」 specifically conveys.
    scene: A student lamenting their exam results.
    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The 「簡単 だった のに」 expresses the speaker's deep disappointment and self-reproach. An easy exam

        english: He was healthy yesterday, but today he has a fever.

    scene: Someone at a meal, feeling full unexpectedly quickly.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The 「食べて い ない のに」 emphasizes the unexpectedness and slight amusement of feeling full without
      having eaten. It points to an illogical or unusual personal physical state. The 「まだ」 reinforces

        english: You are a professional, but why did you make such a simple mistake?

          - プロ で ある {に も かかわら ず}、なぜ そんな 簡単 な ミス を し た の です か？
        english: Notwithstanding that you are a professional, why did you make such a simple mistake?
        hint: 「に も かかわら ず」 is more formal and states a condition despite which something happens. While
          it conveys 'despite,' 「の に」 is more direct in expressing the speaker's disappointment or question
          about an unexpected error.
    scene: A team leader questioning a subordinate's error.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The 「プロ な のに」 conveys the speaker's disappointment and slight reproach. A professional is
      expected to avoid simple mistakes, making this error unexpected and concerning. The formal ending
      「の です か」 softens the criticism slightly, making it a professional inquiry rather than an outright
      accusation.
  - english: Even though the lights are on, it's still dark in here.

          - 電気 が 付い て いる {が}、部屋 は まだ 暗い。
        english: The lights are on, but it's still dark in here.
        hint: 「が」 is a simple conjunctive particle for contrast. It lacks the nuance of an unexpected
          or illogical situation that 「の に」 highlights.
    scene: Someone entering a room at dusk, finding it darker than expected.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The phrase 「付いて いる のに」 expresses subtle surprise at the incongruity. The expectation is that
      with the lights on, the room should be bright. The word 「まだ」 reinforces this sense of surprise.
post_example_writeup: As seen in these examples, 「の に」 serves to highlight a contrast where the second
  clause presents an outcome contrary to what would logically be expected from the first clause. The nuance
  can range from mild surprise to strong disappointment or even criticism, depending on the context and
  the speaker's intent.
