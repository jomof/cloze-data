    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the い-adjective conjugation where the final 「い」 is dropped and replaced with 「く」. 「なかった」 is the past negative form of 「ない」. Thus, it literally combines the adjectival stem with the past negative auxiliary.",
    "writeup": "To form the negative past tense of い-adjectives, the final 「い」 is removed and replaced with 「く」. This 「く」 form is then followed by 「なかった」 for the plain past negative, or 「ありませんでした」 for the polite past negative. Historically, the polite negative form derived from the usage of the u-verb 「ある」 with the 「く」-form of the い-adjective (e.g., 高くあります → 高くありません → 高くありませんでした). While this is technically the complete and grammatically 'correct' way for all 「く」-form conjugations of い-adjectives, in modern Japanese, it is common and acceptable to form the polite negative by simply attaching 「です」 to the plain past negative form, resulting in expressions like 「高くなかったです」. This is often referred to as the 'semi-polite' form.",
