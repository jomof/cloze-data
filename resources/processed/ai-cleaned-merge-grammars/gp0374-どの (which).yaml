jlpt: N5
etymology: The interrogative series こ-そ-あ-ど (ko-so-a-do) is fundamental to Japanese demonstratives and
  interrogatives. The 'ど' (do) component historically signifies 'which' or 'where,' stemming from ancient
  Japanese forms that expressed questioning or uncertainty. Just as 「これ」 (this), 「それ」 (that), and 「あれ」
  (that over there) are specific demonstratives, 「どれ」 (which one) and 「どの」 (which [noun]) are interrogatives
  derived from this same system, used to inquire about identity or location among multiple options. 「どの」specifically
  evolved to directly modify nouns, making it a determiner that points to a specific item within a larger
  set.
writeup: |-
  「どの」 is an interrogative determiner in Japanese, meaning "which." It is used when you want to ask about a specific item from a group of three or more. It is crucial to remember that 「どの」 *always* precedes a noun and cannot stand alone. Think of it as functioning like the English word "which" in phrases like "which book?" or "which car?"

  While English uses "which" for both two and more options, Japanese distinguishes between them. 「どの」 is reserved for situations where there are three or more choices. For situations with only two choices, you would typically use 「どちら」.

  「どの」 specifies a particular item from a set, prompting the listener to identify it. For example, if there are multiple books on a table, you might ask 「どの本が好きですか？」 (Which book do you like?) to pinpoint one specific book.
false_friends:
  - term: どれ (which of 3 or more)
    meaning: which one (among three or more)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どの」is a determiner and always precedes a noun, as in「どの本ですか？」. 「どれ」is a pronoun and stands
      alone, as in「どれですか？」.
    grammar_point: どれ (which of 3 or more)
  - term: どちら (which way, polite)
    meaning: which one (among two), which way (polite)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どちら」is used for choosing between two options or as a polite way to ask for direction/side,
      e.g.,「AとB、どちらがいいですか？」. 「どの」is for three or more options.
    grammar_point: どちら (which way, formal)
  - term: 何 (what)
    meaning: what
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「何」asks "what" or "what kind," e.g.,「何の本ですか？」 (What kind of book is it?). 「どの」asks "which
      specific item" from a group, e.g.,「どの本が好きですか？」 (Which book do you like?).
    grammar_point: 何 (what)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate between 「どの」、「どれ」、 and 「どちら」、 remember that 「どの」 modifies
  a noun directly (e.g., "Which car?"), 「どれ」 stands alone as a pronoun for three or more items (e.g.,
  "Which one?"), and 「どちら」 is for selecting between two items or as a polite way to ask for directions.
  「何」 is a broader interrogative for "what" or "what kind of."

          - 渋谷 駅 に 行く バス は 何 です か？
        english: What is the bus that goes to Shibuya station?

          looking for 'which color' specifically.

post_example_writeup: Notice how in all examples, 「どの」 is immediately followed by the noun it modifies,
  such as 「どの バス」 (which bus), 「どの 色」 (which color), or 「どの 方法」 (which method). This direct relationship
  is key to its usage and distinguishes it from pronouns like 「どれ」.
