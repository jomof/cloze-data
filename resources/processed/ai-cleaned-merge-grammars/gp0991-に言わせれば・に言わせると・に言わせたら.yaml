    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に言わせれば」 comes from 「言う」 (iu, to say), combined with the causative auxiliary verb 「せる/させる」 (to let/make do), and the conditional 「ば」. Literally, it means \"if one is allowed to speak.\"",
    "writeup": "「に言わせれば」 is a structure attached to nouns to indicate that a strong opinion or viewpoint is being expressed by a specific person or group. It is often translated as \"if you ask (A), (B)\" or \"according to (A), (B)\". The literal interpretation is \"if (A) is allowed to speak, then (B)\". This pattern combines the case-marking particle 「に」, the Godan verb 「言う」 (to say), followed by the causative form 「言わせる」 (to let/make say), and a conditional ending such as 「ば」, 「と」, or 「たら」.\n\nWhile 「ば」 is the most common conditional form used, 「と」 and 「たら」 are also grammatically correct and convey a similar meaning. However, 「に言わせたら」 is generally less common than the other two forms.\n\nIt is important to note that when causative verbs like 「させる」 are used, the particle 「に」 typically marks the agent who is *allowed* to perform the action, as is the case with 「に言わせる」. Conversely, the particle 「を」 is more frequently used to mark the agent who is *forced* to perform an action. This distinction is crucial for understanding the nuance of allowance or enablement inherent in 「に言わせる」.\n\nThis pattern can sometimes sound assertive or even self-important, especially when used to express one's own opinions. Therefore, it is advisable to use it sparingly, particularly when conveying your personal views.",
