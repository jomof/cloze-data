    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に言わせれば」 comes from 「言う(iu)」(to say), combined with the causative-passive form of the auxiliary verb 「せる(seru)」 (to let/make do), and the conditional 「ば(ba)」. Literally, it means something close to \"if one were allowed to say.\"",
    "writeup": "「に言わせれば」 is used to indicate that the following statement is an opinion or perspective from a particular person or group. It is similar to saying \"if you ask me\" or \"according to [someone]\". The other forms, 「に言わせると」 and 「に言わせたら」, are nearly identical in meaning, although 「に言わせたら」 is less common. Occasionally, you may see 「から」 used instead of 「に」 (e.g., 「から言わせれば」). This pattern can sometimes sound assertive or self-important, so use it judiciously, especially when expressing your own opinions.",
