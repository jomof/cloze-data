        "[Noun] + に言わせれば": "Expresses an opinion from a specific point of view; 'if you ask me,' 'according to'.",
        "[Noun] + に言わせると": "Similar to に言わせれば, expressing an opinion.",

    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に言わせれば」 comes from 「言う(iu)」(to say), combined with the causative-passive form of the auxiliary verb 「せる(seru)」 (to let/make do), and the conditional 「ば(ba)」. Literally, it means something close to \"if one were allowed to say.\"",
    "writeup": "「に言わせれば」 is used to indicate that the following statement is an opinion or perspective from a particular person or group. It is similar to saying \"if you ask me\" or \"according to [someone]\". The other forms, 「に言わせると」 and 「に言わせたら」, are nearly identical in meaning. This pattern can sometimes sound assertive or self-important, so use it judiciously, especially when expressing your own opinions.",
