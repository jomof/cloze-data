    "etymology": "「誰」の語源は明らかではありませんが、一説には「誰彼 (たれかれ)」という言葉から来ていると言われています。「誰彼」は「あれもこれも」という意味で、特定できない人々を指す言葉でした。この「誰彼」の「誰 (たれ)」が独立して、「誰 (だれ)」という疑問詞になったと考えられています。",
    "writeup": "「誰 (だれ)」 is an interrogative pronoun used to ask \"who\" when the identity of a person is unknown. Its specific role in a sentence is determined by the particle that follows it.\n\n*   **誰 が (dare ga)**: Marks 「誰」 as the subject of a verb, asking \"who\" performed an action or is in a certain state.\n*   **誰 を (dare o)**: Marks 「誰」 as the direct object of a verb, asking \"who\" is the recipient of an action.\n*   **誰 に (dare ni)**: Marks 「誰」 as an indirect object or recipient, asking \"to whom\" or \"from whom\".\n*   **誰 の (dare no)**: Indicates possession, asking \"whose\".\n*   **誰 か (dare ka)**: Combines with 「か」 to mean \"someone\" or \"anyone\" (in questions or negative sentences).\n*   **誰 でも (dare demo)**: Combines with 「でも」 to mean \"anyone\" or \"everyone\" (in affirmative sentences).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\nWhile 「誰」 is broadly used, it's generally considered standard or casual. For more formal or respectful contexts, other expressions are preferred. 「どなた」 is a more polite and honorific (sonkeigo) equivalent, often used when addressing someone unknown in a respectful manner. 「どちら様 (どちらさま)」 is an even more formal and polite term, typically used in business settings or when answering the phone to inquire about a caller's identity. Using 「誰」 in situations requiring high politeness might be perceived as brusque or impolite.",
