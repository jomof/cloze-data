    "etymology": "「誰」の語源は明らかではありませんが、一説には「誰彼 (たれかれ)」という言葉から来ていると言われています。「誰彼」は「あれもこれも」という意味で、特定できない人々を指す言葉でした。この「誰彼」の「誰 (たれ)」が独立して、「誰 (だれ)」という疑問詞になったと考えられています。",
    "writeup": "「誰 (だれ)」 is a pronoun used to ask “who” when the person is unknown. Depending on the particle that follows 「誰」, its meaning can slightly change. For example:\n\n*   「誰が (だれが)」: who (as a subject)\n*   「誰の (だれの)」: whose\n*   「誰か (だれか)」: somebody\n*   「誰でも (だれでも)」: anybody / everyone\n*   「誰にも (だれにも)」: (not) to anyone / (not) to everyone\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   In polite speech, 「どなた」 or 「どちら様」 are used instead of 「誰」. Use 「どなた」 in honorific language (*sonkeigo*) and 「どちら様」 in polite speech (*teineigo*).",
