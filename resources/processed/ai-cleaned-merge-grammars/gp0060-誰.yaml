    "etymology": "The etymology of 「誰」 is not entirely clear. However, one theory suggests it comes from the word 「誰彼 (tare kare)」. 「誰彼」 originally meant \"this and that person\" or \"anyone and everyone,\" referring to unspecified people. It is thought that the 「誰 (tare)」 part of 「誰彼」 then became independent, evolving into the interrogative word 「誰 (dare)」.",
    "writeup": "「誰 (だれ)」 is an interrogative pronoun used to ask \"who\" when the identity of a person is unknown. Its specific role in a sentence is determined by the particle that follows it.\n\n*   **誰 が (dare ga)**: Marks 「誰」 as the subject of a verb, asking \"who\" performed an action or is in a certain state.\n*   **誰 を (dare o)**: Marks 「誰」 as the direct object of a verb, asking \"who\" is the recipient of an action.\n*   **誰 に (dare ni)**: Marks 「誰」 as an indirect object or recipient, asking \"to whom\" or \"from whom\".\n*   **誰 の (dare no)**: Indicates possession, asking \"whose\".\n*   **誰 か (dare ka)**: Combines with 「か」 to mean \"someone\" or \"anyone\" (in questions or negative sentences).\n*   **誰 でも (dare demo)**: Combines with 「でも」 to mean \"anyone\" or \"everyone\" (in affirmative sentences).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\nWhile 「誰」 is broadly used, it's generally considered standard or casual. For more formal or respectful contexts, other expressions are preferred. 「どなた」 is a more polite and honorific (sonkeigo) equivalent, often used when addressing someone unknown in a respectful manner. 「どちら様 (どちらさま)」 is an even more formal and polite term, typically used in business settings or when answering the phone to inquire about a caller's identity. Using 「誰」 in situations requiring high politeness might be perceived as brusque or impolite.",
