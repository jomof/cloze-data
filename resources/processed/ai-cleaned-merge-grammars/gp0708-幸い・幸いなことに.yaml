        "usage-context": "general",
        "function": "expresses relief or positive surprise regarding an outcome",

        "source": "general Japanese usage"
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「幸い」(saiwai) originates from the adjective meaning 'happiness' or 'good fortune'. The phrase 「幸いなことに」 extends this to specifically highlight instances where good luck or fortune plays a role. Historically, 「幸いなことに」 is an extension of 「ことに」. 「ことに」 itself is a combination of こと ('thing') and the particle に, which literally means 'to that which is (A).' 「ことに」 is generally used to emphasize a strong feeling, positive or negative, regarding situation (B).",
    "writeup": "「幸い」 and 「幸いなことに」 are phrases used to express that something occurred fortunately or luckily. 「幸い」 can function as a concise adverb, while 「幸いなことに」 acts as a slightly more formal adverbial phrase, typically positioned at the beginning of a sentence. This structure emphasizes the speaker's feeling of good fortune regarding a specific event. The use of 「ことに」 intensifies this sentiment, conveying a nuance similar to 'to my good fortune' or 'luckily enough.' This reflects the root meaning of 幸い as a な-adjective signifying 'blessedness' or 'luck.' Both expressions are versatile and can be used in various contexts to convey a sense of relief or gratitude.",

            "term": "ことに",
            "meaning": "Especially, in particular, to my...",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「幸いなことに」, 「ことに」 by itself doesn't inherently imply luck or fortune. It typically functions to emphasize a particular aspect, feeling, or surprising fact, often conveying a sense of 'to one's surprise' or 'remarkably'."

        {
            "term": "運良く",
            "meaning": "By good luck, luckily",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While also indicating good luck, `運良く` emphasizes pure chance or coincidence, whereas `幸い` often carries a deeper sense of relief or gratitude for a fortunate outcome, particularly when a negative situation was avoided. `幸い` can feel more personal or providential."

        {
            "term": "無事に",
            "meaning": "Safely, without incident",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Means 'safely' or 'without incident'. While often related to positive outcomes, `無事に` describes the state of being safe or completing something smoothly, without the explicit connotation of 'luckily' or 'fortunately' that `幸い` conveys when an event unexpectedly turns out well or favorably."

            "term": "なんとか",
            "meaning": "Somehow, barely, managing to",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Means 'somehow' or 'barely managing'. It implies a difficult effort to achieve something, often by the skin of one's teeth, and lacks the inherent positive 'fortunate' aspect of `幸い`. `なんとか` often suggests struggle, while `幸い` implies a blessed or favorable outcome."

            "meaning": "By chance, accidentally, coincidentally",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Means 'by chance' or 'accidentally'. It refers to a pure coincidence without any implication of positive or negative fortune, unlike `幸い` which specifically highlights a favorable outcome or a fortunate turn of events."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「ことに」 can intensify feelings or highlight surprising facts, 「幸いなことに」 specifically refers to good fortune. Other similar expressions like 「運良く」, 「無事に」, 「なんとか」, and 「たまたま」 also describe favorable or coincidental circumstances, but each carries a distinct nuance. 「運良く」 focuses on simple chance. 「無事に」 emphasizes safety or completion without incident. 「なんとか」 implies barely succeeding through effort. 「たまたま」 indicates pure coincidence without judgment of fortune. Choose `幸い` or `幸いなことに` when you want to express a sense of relief, gratitude, or the unexpected blessing of a positive outcome.",
