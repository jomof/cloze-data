    "etymology": "The term 「幸い」 originates from the adjective 「幸い」 (saiwai), meaning 'happiness' or 'good fortune.' The phrase 「幸いなことに」 extends this to specifically highlight instances where good luck or fortune plays a role.",
    "writeup": "「幸い」 and 「幸いなことに」 are used to express that something happened fortunately or luckily. 「幸い」 can stand alone as an adverb, while 「幸いなことに」 is an adverbial phrase, often placed at the beginning of a sentence, to emphasize the speaker's feeling of good fortune regarding a specific event. The 「ことに」 part intensifies the feeling, similar to saying \"to my good fortune\" or \"luckily enough\".",
