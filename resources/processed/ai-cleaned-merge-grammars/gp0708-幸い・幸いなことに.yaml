    },
    "etymology": "The term 「幸い」(saiwai) originates from the adjective meaning 'happiness' or 'good fortune'. The phrase 「幸いなことに」 extends this to specifically highlight instances where good luck or fortune plays a role. Historically, 「幸いなことに」 is an extension of 「ことに」. 「ことに」 itself is a combination of こと ('thing') and the particle に, which literally means 'to that which is (A).' 「ことに」 is generally used to emphasize a strong feeling, positive or negative, regarding situation (B).",
    "writeup": "「幸い」 and 「幸いなことに」 are phrases used to express that something occurred fortunately or luckily. 「幸い」 can function as a concise adverb, while 「幸いなことに」 acts as a slightly more formal adverbial phrase, typically positioned at the beginning of a sentence. This structure emphasizes the speaker's feeling of good fortune regarding a specific event. The use of 「ことに」 intensifies this sentiment, conveying a nuance similar to 'to my good fortune' or 'luckily enough.' This reflects the root meaning of 幸い as a な-adjective signifying 'blessedness' or 'luck.' Both expressions are versatile and can be used in various contexts to convey a sense of relief or gratitude.",
