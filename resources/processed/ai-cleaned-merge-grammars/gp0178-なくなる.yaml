    "details": {
        "Usage": "This grammar point indicates the cessation of a state or action. It often describes something that used to be the case but is no longer true.",
        "Register": "Generally used in both casual and formal contexts."

        "Verb (negative form) + なる": "Indicates that something has stopped occurring or is no longer in a certain state.",
        "Adjective (い-stem) + くなる": "Indicates a change where something is no longer in a certain state.",
        "Adjective (な-stem) / Noun + (では/じゃ)なくなる": "Indicates that something is no longer a certain state or noun."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「なくなる」 is derived from the verb 「なくなる」 (nakunaru), which means \"to disappear\" or \"to be lost.\" In this grammatical construction, it retains the sense of something ceasing to exist or occurring, but it's applied to states and actions rather than physical objects.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「なくなる」 indicates that a certain state or action has ceased or is no longer the case. It is used to describe changes where something used to occur or be true, but it doesn't anymore. This structure can be applied to verbs in the negative form, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives/nouns.\n\n*   When used with a verb in the negative form (ない), it signifies that an action has stopped occurring. For example, 「食べなくなる」 (tabenaku naru) means \"to stop eating.\"\n*   When used with い-adjectives, the い is dropped, and 「くなる」 is added. For example, 「高くなくなる」 (takaku naku naru) means \"to no longer be expensive.\"\n*   When used with な-adjectives or nouns, 「では/じゃなくなる」 is added. For example, 「静かじゃなくなる」 (shizuka ja naku naru) means \"to no longer be quiet,\" and 「先生じゃなくなる」 (sensei ja naku naru) means \"to no longer be a teacher.\"",
