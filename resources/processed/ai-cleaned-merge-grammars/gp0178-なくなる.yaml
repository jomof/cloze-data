    "meaning": "to no longer be; to cease to be; to stop; to run out",

        "Register": "Generally used in formal and informal speech.",

    "etymology": "The grammar point 「なくなる」 is formed by combining the verb 「なくなる」 (nakunaru), meaning \"to disappear\" or \"to run out,\" with the particle 「なる」 (naru), meaning \"to become.\" The combination creates the sense of \"becoming nonexistent\" or \"ceasing to be.\"",
    "writeup": "「なくなる」 is used to express that a certain action or state has ceased or is no longer the case. It can be attached to the negative form of a verb, the stem of an い-adjective with 「く」, or a noun/な-adjective with 「じゃ」 (or 「ではなく」 in more formal speech). This grammar point indicates a change from a previous state to one where something no longer exists or occurs. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The negative form of the verb indicates what is no longer happening.\n*   When used with adjectives, it shows that something is no longer in a certain state (e.g., no longer expensive, no longer quiet).\n*   With nouns, it indicates that someone or something is no longer a certain thing (e.g., no longer a student, no longer a teacher).",
