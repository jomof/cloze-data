    "etymology": "The grammar point 「なくなる」 is derived from the verb 「なくなる」 (nakunaru), meaning \"to disappear\" or \"to be lost.\" In this grammatical construction, it retains the sense of something ceasing to exist or occur, but it's applied more broadly to states and actions, indicating a change from a previous condition.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「なくなる」 expresses that a certain state or action has ceased to exist or is no longer the case. It is a fundamental expression used to describe transitions where something that previously held true or occurred frequently has now stopped. This grammatical pattern emphasizes the **change** that led to the cessation.\n\nThere are several ways to form 「なくなる」, depending on the type of word it follows:\n\n*   **Verb (plain negative form) + なくなる**: This indicates that an action or a state expressed by a verb has stopped occurring. For example, 「食べなくなる」 (tabe naku naru) means \"to stop eating\" or \"to no longer eat.\" It's often used with potential verbs, such as 「話せなくなる」 (hanase naku naru), meaning \"to become unable to speak\" or \"to lose the ability to speak.\"\n*   **い-Adjective (stem) + くなくなる**: For い-adjectives, the final い is dropped, and 「くなくなる」 is appended. This signifies that the quality described by the adjective is no longer present. For instance, 「高くなくなる」 (takaku naku naru) means \"to no longer be expensive.\"\n*   **な-Adjective (stem) + (では/じゃ)なくなる**: For な-adjectives, 「ではなくなる」 (or the more casual 「じゃなくなる」) is added. This indicates that the state described by the な-adjective is no longer true. For example, 「静かじゃなくなる」 (shizuka ja naku naru) means \"to no longer be quiet.\"\n*   **Noun + (では/じゃ)なくなる**: Similarly, for nouns, 「ではなくなる」 (or 「じゃなくなる」) is used to express that someone or something is no longer identified as that noun. For example, 「学生じゃなくなる」 (gakusei ja naku naru) means \"to no longer be a student.\"\n\n「なくなる」 implies a process or a gradual shift over time, leading to the current state of cessation. It's distinct from simply stating that something *is not* the case, as it highlights the **change** from a previous state of being or doing.",
