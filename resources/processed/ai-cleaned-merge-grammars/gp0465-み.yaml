    "etymology": "The suffix 「み」 is thought to be related to the noun 「身」 (mi), meaning \"body\" or \"substance.\" This suggests that 「み」 originally conveyed a sense of inherent quality or essence residing within something.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「み」 is commonly used in Japanese to transform adjectives into nouns, often translated as \"~ness\" in English. It highlights the condition or place in which something exists in a constant state, focusing on innate qualities rather than varying degrees. To use 「み」, attach it to the stem form of い-adjectives (removing the い) or な-adjectives (removing the な). For example, 「悲しい」 (sad) becomes 「悲しみ」 (sadness), and 「静かだ」 (quiet) becomes 「静かさ」 (quietness). Be cautious: 「み」 emphasizes inherent qualities, not measurable degrees. It can also directly substitute 「味」 (aji), meaning \"taste,\" describing a quality of something that can be sensed, like taste or color.",
