    "etymology": "The suffix 「み」 is thought to originate from the noun 「身 (み)」 meaning \"body\" or \"substance.\" Over time, it evolved to abstractly represent the inherent qualities or conditions associated with something.",
    "writeup": "「み」 is a suffix in Japanese that transforms adjectives into nouns. It is often translated as \"~ness\" in English, but it highlights the **condition** or **place** in which something exists in a constant state. It emphasizes inherent qualities that are not specifically measured. To use 「み」, attach it to the stem form of either い-adjectives (remove the い) or な-adjectives (remove the な). Sometimes, 「み」 is used directly as a substitute for 「味」, meaning \"taste,\" describing a quality that can be sensed, such as taste or color.",
