id: gp0131
meaning: Indicates the point from which someone or something departs or separates.
pronunciation:
  katakana: ヲ
  romaji: o
formation:
  '[Place] + を + [Verb of Movement]': Indicates the location from which movement begins.
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  particle-syntactic-function: object
  function: Marks the starting point of movement.
  nuance: Emphasizes the action of leaving or departing from a place, unlike から which simply focuses on
    the origin.
  colocation: Often used with verbs of movement such as 出る (deru - to leave), 離れる (hanareru - to separate),
    and 降りる (oriru - to get off).
etymology: The particle 「を」 originally had a broader range of uses, but over time, its function narrowed
  to primarily marking the direct object of a verb. Its use to indicate a point of departure is a slightly
  less common, but still important, application of the particle, semantically marking the 'object' that
  is being moved out of or away from.
writeup: The particle 「を」, when used with verbs of movement, indicates the location from which someone
  or something departs. It emphasizes the action of leaving or separating from that place. This usage
  is distinct from 「から」, which also marks a starting point but focuses more on the location itself rather
  than the act of departure. Understanding this nuance is **essential** for accurately interpreting Japanese
  sentences involving movement.
false_friends:
  - term: から (from)
    meaning: from; starting point
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「を」, 「から」 focuses on the location as the origin, not the action of leaving it. For
      example, 「東京から来ました」 (I came from Tokyo) focuses on Tokyo as the origin.
    grammar_point: から (from)
  - term: に (location, direction)
    meaning: to; toward; at (a place)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「を」 indicates departure, 「に」 often indicates arrival or destination. For example, 「東京に行きます」
      (I go to Tokyo) implies arrival in Tokyo, contrasting with leaving from it.
    grammar_point: に (fixed point・target・time)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「を」 and 「から」 can both indicate a starting point, remember that 「を」 emphasizes
  the **action** of departing from a place, whereas 「から」 simply indicates the location where something
  originates. When describing movement, consider whether you want to highlight the departure itself or
  simply state the origin.

  is consistently used with verbs that imply a physical separation from a location, such as 「出る」, 「降りる」,
  「離れる」, and 「飛び出す」. This contrasts with 「から」, which denotes a broader origin without the same emphasis
  on the act of *leaving* a specific place. Pay close attention to the verb used to determine whether
  「を」 or 「から」 is more appropriate.
