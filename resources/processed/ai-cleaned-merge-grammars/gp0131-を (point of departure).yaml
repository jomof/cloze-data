    "details": {
        "Function": "Marks the starting point of movement.",
        "Related Expression": "Often used in conjunction with verbs of movement such as 出る (deru - to leave), 離れる (hanareru - to separate), and 降りる (oriru - to get off).",
        "Contrast with から": "While both を and から can indicate a starting point, を emphasizes the action of leaving or departing from a place, while から focuses more on the starting point itself."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「を」 originally had a broader range of uses, but over time, its function narrowed to primarily marking the direct object of a verb. Its use to indicate a point of departure is a slightly less common, but still important, application of the particle.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「を」, when used with verbs of movement, indicates the location from which someone or something departs. It emphasizes the action of leaving or separating from that place. This usage is distinct from 「から」, which also marks a starting point but focuses more on the location itself rather than the act of departure. Common verbs used with this construction include 「出る (でる)」 (to leave), 「離れる (はなれる)」 (to separate), and 「降りる (おりる)」 (to get off). Understanding this nuance is **essential** for accurately interpreting Japanese sentences involving movement.",
