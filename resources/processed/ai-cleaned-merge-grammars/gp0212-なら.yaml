    "etymology": "なら is considered an abbreviation of ならば, the hypothetical form of なり, a classical auxiliary verb. なり originally meant \"to be,\" functioning similarly to the auxiliary verb だ.",
    "writeup": "なら is often used to mean \"if.\" It's considered an abbreviation of ならば, the hypothetical form of なり, a classical auxiliary verb not often used in modern Japanese. Since なり originally meant \"to be\", it functions similarly to the auxiliary verb だ. It often pairs with nouns or phrases nominalized with の. However, unlike だ or です, なら can attach directly to verbs or い-adjectives without の.\n\n**Important:** Because なら is an abbreviation of ならば, it's strictly used to make guesses about what *may* or *could* happen. It's not used for results produced by effort or training. \n\n**Do not** confuse this なら with the particle なり, which can mean \"as soon as\" or \"just after\". Fortunately, the particle なり is not that common in modern Japanese.",
