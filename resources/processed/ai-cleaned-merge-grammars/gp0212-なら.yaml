    "etymology": "「なら」 is considered to be an abbreviation of 「ならば」, the hypothetical form of 「なり」, a classical auxiliary verb. 「なり」 originally meant \"to be,\" similar to the auxiliary verb 「だ」. This explains its use with nouns and na-adjectives. However, unlike 「だ」, 「なら」 can be attached directly to verbs and i-adjectives without needing to nominalize them using 「の」.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「なら」 expresses a condition or supposition. It translates to \"if,\" \"if it's the case,\" or \"as for.\" It's essentially a shortened version of 「ならば」. Because 「なら」 comes from the classical auxiliary verb 「なり」, meaning \"to be\", it functions similarly to 「だ」. It commonly pairs with nouns and na-adjectives. Unlike 「だ」, 「なら」 can attach directly to verbs and i-adjectives without nominalization. 「なら」 is used when making guesses or assumptions about what *may* or *could* happen in certain situations, rather than stating results that are produced through effort or training. Note that this usage is different from the particle 「なり」, which means \"as soon as\" or \"just after.\"",
