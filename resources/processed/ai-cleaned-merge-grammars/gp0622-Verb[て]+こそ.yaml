    "etymology": "The particle 「こそ」 emphasizes the preceding word or phrase. When combined with the て-form of a verb, it creates a strong sense of conditionality or necessity.",
    "writeup": "「Verb[て]+こそ」 emphasizes that a particular action or condition is **essential** for a certain outcome. It conveys the idea that something can only be realized, understood, or appreciated *because* of a preceding action or experience. It's similar to saying \"only if,\" \"precisely because,\" or \"not until\" something happens. The nuance is that the first action is a **necessary condition** for the second. Sometimes the condition might be better translated as 'because'.",

It does not fit the definition of a conjugation of the grammar point itself. (Rule 0: 'Only list conjugations that, when used, preserve the meaning of the grammar point.')",
