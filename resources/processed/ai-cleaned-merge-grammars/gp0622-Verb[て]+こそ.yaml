    "etymology": "The grammar point combines the te-form of a verb (indicating a prior action or state) with the particle 「こそ」, which emphasizes the preceding word. Thus, 「Verb[て]+こそ」 emphasizes that only *after* doing the verb can the result be achieved.",
    "writeup": "Similar to how the particle 「こそ」 highlights a particular word as being the precise or exact reason for something, its combination with the て-form of a verb indicates that B is absolutely reliant on A. This reliance can be translated in several different ways, and will usually become clear in the B part of sentences.\n\nStandard interpretations include \"only if A, B\", \"unless A, B\", or \"until A, B\". The reliance that B has on A can be translated in several different ways, but the most common interpretations are that A will determine either the outcome, assessment, or evaluation of B, based on the speaker's opinion, values, or understanding of the situation.",
