    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "adverb",
        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "Used to describe an action or event that occurs abruptly and often unexpectedly, without apparent prior indication or reason.",
        "nuance": "Carries a stronger nuance of 'out of the blue' or 'unprompted' compared to similar adverbs like 急に (kyuuni) or 突然 (totsuzen). It emphasizes the lack of preparation or predictability."
    },
    "etymology": "「いきなり」 derives from 「行き成り」, an older expression describing how a situation develops or unfolds unexpectedly. While the kanji form 「行き成り」 exists, 「いきなり」 is almost exclusively written in hiragana in modern Japanese. This historical origin explains its nuance of something happening 'without clear preceding events' or 'out of its own accord'.",
    "writeup": "「いきなり」 is an adverb that conveys the meaning of \"suddenly,\" \"all of a sudden,\" \"without warning,\" or \"for no apparent reason.\" It describes actions or events that happen abruptly and unexpectedly, often surprising those involved due to the lack of any prior indication or build-up. As an adverb, 「いきなり」 primarily appears at the beginning of a sentence or directly before the verb it modifies. Its strength lies in emphasizing the unprompted nature of an event, rather than just its speed. For instance, while an action might happen quickly, 「いきなり」 highlights the lack of predictability leading up to it. It is almost exclusively written in hiragana in contemporary Japanese, despite its historical kanji form 「行き成り」. This reflects its natural integration into everyday speech as a single, cohesive concept.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While 「～だす」 indicates the beginning of an action, 「いきなり」 emphasizes the unexpectedness and lack of prior warning for that action's start."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「いつの間にか」 implies something happened without one's awareness or without conscious notice, whereas 「いきなり」 highlights the abruptness of the event itself, even if one is aware of it."

        {
            "term": "たちまち",
            "meaning": "Immediately; Quickly; Suddenly; In a moment or flash",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「たちまち」 primarily focuses on the speed and instantaneousness at which something happens, whereas 「いきなり」 highlights the lack of warning or expectation, regardless of how quickly it unfolds."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「急に」 often means 'quickly' or 'abruptly', implying a change that happens with speed. 「いきなり」 places more emphasis on the lack of prior signs or a preceding cause, making it feel more 'out of the blue'."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「突然」 is very close to 「いきなり」, often interchangeable, but 「いきなり」 tends to carry a stronger sense of being 'unprompted' or 'for no apparent reason'. 「突然」 might imply that something unexpected happened, but 「いきなり」 adds a layer of 'without any preceding action or logical flow'."

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To differentiate between these similar expressions: 「いきなり」 is best used when emphasizing an action or event that occurs without any warning or apparent reason, making it feel 'out of the blue'. 「～だす」 specifically marks the sudden commencement of an action. 「いつの間にか」 highlights that something occurred without one's awareness. 「たちまち」 focuses on the speed of an occurrence, indicating something happened in an instant. 「急に」 and 「突然」 are general terms for 'suddenly', with 「いきなり」 providing a stronger sense of the event being unprompted.",
