    "etymology": "**いきなり** comes from **行き成り**, an older expression that described how a situation unfolds or develops unexpectedly. While **行き成り** can be written in kanji, **いきなり** is almost exclusively written in hiragana.",
    "writeup": "**いきなり**, almost exclusively written in hiragana, is an adverb that means \"suddenly,\" \"unexpectedly,\" or \"out of the blue.\" It describes actions or events that happen abruptly, without warning. As an adverb, it usually appears at the beginning of a sentence or directly before the verb it modifies. While often used simply to mean \"suddenly,\" it carries a nuance of unexpectedness, like a \"sudden turn of events.\"",
