formation:
  Noun + 次第だ: Indicates that the outcome or state is entirely determined by the preceding noun, often
    concluding a sentence.
  Noun + 次第で: Indicates that something varies or is decided based on the preceding noun, acting as a determinant

jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: Used to express that an outcome, state, or decision is entirely contingent upon a preceding
    noun.
  function: To indicate that an outcome, state, or decision is contingent upon a preceding noun, highlighting
    its decisive role.
  nuance: Emphasizes a direct and often unavoidable dependency, where the preceding noun is the primary,
    decisive determinant. It conveys that the outcome is 'all up to' or 'contingent upon' that specific
    factor, implying a natural consequence.
  colocation: Often follows nouns related to effort, results, conditions, and personal attributes.
  grammatical-role: Functions predicatively with 「次第だ」 (meaning 'depends on') or adverbially with 「次第で」
    (meaning 'depending on') to modify a subsequent clause.
  logical-flow: A (determinant) → B (outcome/decision)
  temporal-flow: The determination or outcome (B) follows the existence or occurrence of the determinant
    (A).
  spatial-flow: Not applicable to this grammar point's primary function. It's a conceptual flow of dependency
    rather than physical space.
etymology: The word 「次第」(shidai) originally meant 'order,' 'sequence,' or 'circumstances.' This etymology
  helps explain its evolution to signify that an outcome or subsequent action is determined by a preceding
  factor or condition, as if that factor sets the 'order' or 'process' for what follows. It indicates
  a direct relationship where the former dictates the latter.
writeup: |-
  The grammar patterns 「次第だ」 and 「次第で」 are used to express that an outcome, a state, or the success of something is entirely contingent upon, or determined by, a preceding noun. This highlights the noun as the crucial deciding factor, often conveying a sense of 'it's all up to...' or 'it hinges on...'.

  When used as 「次第だ」, it typically concludes a sentence, stating a direct and often definitive dependency. For example, 「結果は努力次第だ」 (The result depends on effort). This form is generally formal or semi-formal.

  When used as 「次第で」, it usually precedes a verb or another clause, indicating that something will vary, change, or be decided based on the preceding noun. For example, 「値段は品質次第で変わる」 (The price changes depending on the quality). This form functions adverbially, modifying the subsequent action or state.

  A slight variation is 「次第では」, which adds a hypothetical nuance, implying 'if it depends on this (then...)' or 'depending on the circumstances.' This suggests considering a possible outcome based on certain conditions.

  This grammar point emphasizes the decisive role of the noun in shaping the situation or outcome. It's not merely a cause or a method, but the very essence of what determines the result. While the word 「次第」 appears in other grammar patterns (e.g., meaning 'as soon as' or explaining 'circumstances leading to'), these are distinct grammatical usages, focusing on different aspects of sequence or consequence.
false_friends:
  - term: によって・による・により
    meaning: By means of, according to, depending on, because of, due to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both can mean 'depending on,' 「によって」 is broader, indicating *means*, *cause*, or *variation
      according to* a rule. 「次第だ・次第で」 emphasizes the *direct determination* of an outcome by the preceding
      noun, as the decisive factor.
    grammar_point: '[Noun]によって (means・method)'
  - term: にかかっている
    meaning: To depend on (responsibility, decision)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「にかかっている」 implies that the *responsibility*, *decision*, or *fate* of something rests with
      the noun, often with a sense of reliance or burden. 「次第だ・次第で」 is more general about the outcome
      being *determined* by the noun, without necessarily emphasizing responsibility.
    grammar_point: にかかっている (to depend on)
  - term: に応じて
    meaning: Depending on, based on, according to, in response to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に応じて」 means 'in accordance with' or 'in response to,' implying adjustment or conformity to
      the noun, often with flexibility. 「次第だ・次第で」 signifies that the outcome is *determined* by the noun
      itself, not merely adapted to it.
    grammar_point: に応じて (depending on)
  - term: 如何・いかん
    meaning: How; what; (depending on) how/what; (according to) how/what; depend on
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「如何 (ikaga)」 is more formal/literary, often implying 'how' something is handled or 'regardless
      of' (in compounds like `如何によらず`). 「次第だ・次第で」 is more direct about dependency.
    grammar_point: いかん (depending on)
  - term: 〜かは〜によって違う
    meaning: Depends on, Changes depending on, Differs depending on
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is a more explicit and descriptive phrase stating that something differs based on a condition.
      「次第だ・次第で」 concisely conveys that the preceding noun is the sole determinant.
    grammar_point: 〜かは〜によって違う (depends on)
  - term: 次第です
    meaning: This is why; The circumstances are such that; Therefore (a situation arises)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「次第です」 (often following a verb or clause) is a formal and humble expression used to explain
      the *reason* or *circumstances* that led to a situation. In contrast, 「次第だ・次第で」 states that an outcome
      is *determined by* a preceding noun, not that the noun explains the circumstances leading to it.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:次第です (circumstances leading to)
  - term: 次第 (as soon as)
    meaning: As soon as; immediately after
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This usage of 「次第」 (typically Verb-masu stem + 次第) expresses immediacy. While sharing the
      same root, its grammatical function and meaning are distinct from 「次第だ・次第で」, which expresses dependency.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:次第 (as soon as)
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share the idea of dependency, 「次第だ」 and 「次第で」 emphasize
  a direct relationship between a factor and its outcome, often implying it's the primary or sole determinant,
  without necessarily implying adaptation, responsibility, or being a general causal link. Choosing the
  right expression depends on the specific nuance you want to convey. For a more general cause or means,
  「によって」 is often used. If you want to express adapting to a certain situation, 「に応じて」 will be more appropriate.
  If you want to place the responsibility on something, then 「にかかっている」 will be more appropriate. If you
  are explaining the background or reason for a situation, the formal 「次第です」 might be used. But if you
  just want to simply express that something depends directly on something else, then 「次第だ」 and 「次第で」
  will be the most appropriate.
examples:
  - english: Everything depends on your effort.
    japanese:
      - 全て は あなた の 努力 【 次第 だ 】。
      - 全て は あなた の 努力 【 次第 です 】。
    english_literally: Everything your effort depends.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 全て は あなた の 努力 に よっ て 決まる。
        english: Everything is decided by your effort.
        hint: While 「によって」 can also express dependency, 「次第だ」 emphasizes that the outcome is *all up to*
          the effort, not just determined *by means of* it. We're looking for an inherent and decisive
          dependency.
    scene: A teacher encouraging a student who is struggling but has potential.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The phrase 「全ては」 emphasizes that *everything* hinges on the effort, leaving no room for other
      factors, reinforcing the direct dependency expressed by 「次第だ」. This is a general truth conveyed
      in a formal setting.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 値段 は 品質 に よっ て 変わり ます。
        english: The price changes according to the quality.
        hint: 「によって」 here means 'according to' a rule or characteristic. 「次第で」 specifically implies the
          price is *determined by* the quality, not just in accordance with it. We're looking for the
          price being decided directly by the quality.
    scene: A shop owner explaining pricing to a client interested in a custom order.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: The use of 「変わります」 directly after 「品質次第で」 clearly links the variability of the price to the
      quality, making the dependency explicit and immediate. This is a common phrase in business settings
      to state a direct causal relationship.
  - english: Next month's plans depend on the weather.
    japanese:

        hint: 「にかかっている」 suggests that the plans are entirely reliant or 'hinge' on the weather, often

          dependency.

    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly

        english: It's not that his success is decided by talent.
        hint: 「～によって決まるわけではない」 states that something is not decided by a certain factor in a more indirect
          way. We're looking for a direct negation of dependency on talent.
    scene: A coach explaining the true source of a player's achievement.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)

    english_literally: Project's budget ultimately his approval depending on (past).

    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: When discussing a past decision, 「次第だった」 emphasizes that the budget was *contingent* on his
      approval, conveying the inherent dependency more than a simple factual statement of it being 'decided
      by' him.

    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「ぜ」 (ze) is a colloquial male sentence-final particle expressing emphasis or assertion.

      tone, emphasizing that the decision rests entirely with the 'listener's male' appetite.

    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The sentence-final particle 「わ」 (wa) is typically used by 'female' speakers to express a soft
      assertion or personal sentiment, fitting an intimate conversation with a 'male' partner. 「二人の気持ち」
      (futari no kimochi) highlights the mutual aspect of their feelings influencing the future.

        english: Whether this problem is resolved or not is due to his attitude.
        hint: 「による」 implies 'because of' or 'dependent on' in a more general sense. 「次第だ」 directly asserts

    scene: Colleagues discussing a difficult interpersonal issue at work.
    register: formal
    setting: professional

    scene: A ship's officer informing passengers about a delay.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: A 'male ship's officer' uses 「次第で」 to formally communicate to a 'group' of 'passengers' that
      the departure time is directly contingent upon the captain's decision, highlighting a clear chain
      of command and reliance on that specific factor.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 「次第だ・次第で(は)」 can be used in various contexts, from personal
  decisions to professional and national issues. It is a versatile expression for emphasizing that a particular
  factor is the deciding element in a situation. The nuance of 「次第では」, with its hypothetical implication,
  is also key for considering potential outcomes based on conditions.
