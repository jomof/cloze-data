    "etymology": "This expression combines the verb 「言う (iu)」 (to say), the adverbial particle 「まで (made)」 (until), the particle 「も (mo)」 (also, even), and the い-adjective 「ない (nai)」 (not). Literally, it suggests that something is so obvious that there's no need to even mention it.",
    "writeup": "「言うまでもない (Iu made mo nai)」 translates to \"it goes without saying\" or \"it is needless to say.\" It's used to indicate that something is so obvious that it doesn't require explicit mention. Unlike 「～は言うまでもない」, which typically follows a phrase, 「言うまでもない」 often starts the sentence. It can be followed by 「ことだが」, 「が」, 「けど」, adding a \"but\" nuance. This phrase is a polite way to express something obvious without sounding arrogant.",
