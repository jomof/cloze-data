    "etymology": "The phrase is a combination of 「言う(iu)」 (to say), 「まで(made)」 (until, to the extent of), 「も(mo)」 (even), and 「ない(nai)」 (not). Literally, it means \"not even to the extent of saying it,\" implying that something is so obvious that it doesn't need to be said.",
    "writeup": "「言うまでもない」 typically comes at the beginning of a sentence. It expresses that something is obvious or needless to say. It's often followed by words like 「ことだが」, 「が」, or 「けど」 to add a \"but\" nuance. Unlike 「〜は言うまでもない」, which follows the information it emphasizes, 「言うまでもない」 introduces the obvious point first.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   Using 「言うまでもない」 is a polite way to state the obvious without sounding arrogant.",
