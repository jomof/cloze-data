pronunciation:
  katakana: ニノットッテ・ニソクシテ
  romaji: ni nottote・ni sokushite
formation:
  Noun + に則って/に即して: Used to describe an action or state that is carried out in conformity with a rule,
    standard, or principle (に則って) or in adaptation to a specific situation or reality (に即して).
jlpt: N1
etymology: Both 「則る (のっとる)」 and 「即する (そくする)」 have their origins in describing adherence or conformity.
  「則」 fundamentally refers to rules, laws, or norms, stemming from ancient concepts of patterns and standards.
  Thus, 「に則って」 signifies acting strictly according to established regulations or traditions. On the other
  hand, 「即」 conveys immediacy, fittingness, or being in contact with something. Therefore, 「に即して」 implies
  adapting or adjusting one's actions or thoughts to a specific situation, reality, or immediate context.
  The combination with the particle 「に」 establishes the rule or reality as the standard against which
  the action is measured.
writeup: |-
  The expressions 「に則って」 and 「に即して」 are formal adverbial phrases used to indicate that an action or statement is carried out or formulated in accordance with something. While both convey a sense of conformity, they carry distinct nuances that are important for accurate usage.

  **に則って (ni nottote)**
  This form emphasizes strict adherence to established rules, laws, principles, traditions, or precedents. It suggests that an action is performed exactly as dictated by a set standard. Think of it as following a blueprint precisely or upholding a long-standing custom. It is often used in legal, academic, or formal organizational contexts where precision and compliance are paramount.

  **に即して (ni sokushite)**
  This form focuses on adapting to or being appropriate for a specific situation, reality, or actual conditions. It implies that one's actions or statements are realistic, practical, and directly relevant to the current circumstances. Unlike 「に則って」 which looks at fixed rules, 「に即して」 looks at the present state of affairs and adjusts accordingly. It's about being pertinent and realistic.

  **Key Differences:**
  *   **に則って**: Focuses on **rules, laws, principles, traditions**. Implies **strict, prescribed adherence**.
  *   **に即して**: Focuses on **situations, facts, realities**. Implies **adaptation, practicality, relevance**.

  For example, when discussing following the law, 「法律に則って」 would be appropriate. When discussing making a proposal realistic, 「現状に即して」 would be used. They are interchangeable only in very broad senses, but their specific nuances make them distinct tools for expressing conformity in formal Japanese.

  - term: に沿って
    meaning: Along; in accordance with; along the lines of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「に沿って」 also means "in accordance with," it often implies following a general path, plan,
      or guideline rather than strict adherence to a defined rule or adapting to a specific reality. It
      suggests moving *alongside* something.
    grammar_point: ～に沿って (in line with・in accordance with・following)
  - term: に基づいて
    meaning: Based on; founded on
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に基づいて」 means that something is founded upon or derived from certain facts, data, or principles.
      It indicates the *basis* for something, but not necessarily a strict *adherence* to it (as with
      「に則って」) or a *practical adaptation* to a situation (as with 「に即して」).
    grammar_point: にもとづいて (based on)
  - term: に従って
    meaning: In accordance with; following; as a result of (proportional change)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に従って」 can indeed mean "in accordance with," making it quite similar to 「に則って」 in some contexts
      (e.g., following instructions). However, it also has a common meaning of "as X happens, Y also happens"
      (proportional change), which is distinct. When it means "in accordance with," it implies following
      directions or guidance, which is less rigid than 「に則って」's focus on strict rules and traditions,
      and less about adapting to reality than 「に即して」.
    grammar_point: に従って・従い (in accordance with and proportional change)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「に則って」 and 「に即して」 both relate to conforming, it is important to distinguish
  them from other similar expressions. 「に沿って」 often means to follow a general course or plan, like 「計画に沿って進める」
  (to proceed along the plan), suggesting a less rigid adherence than 「に則って」. 「に基づいて」 simply states that
  something is *founded* on certain information or principles, such as 「データに基づいて分析する」 (to analyze based
  on data), without necessarily implying strict execution or practical adaptation. Lastly, 「に従って」 can
  mean to follow instructions or rules, but it also commonly indicates a proportional change, like 「時間の経過に従って」
  (as time passes). Unlike 「に則って」's strictness or 「に即して」's adaptability, 「に従って」 is often about simply
  following a given direction or process.
