formation:
  Verb (plain form) + であろう: Indicates a strong likelihood or formal conjecture for verbs. Often interchangeable
    with Verb (plain form) + よう in formal contexts.
  I-adjective (plain form) + であろう: A formal way to express conjecture for i-adjectives.
  Noun + であろう: Indicates a strong probability or logical conclusion for nouns.
  な-Adjective (stem) + であろう: Indicates a strong probability or logical conclusion for な-adjectives.
  Past Copula (であった) + であろう: Used to express conjecture about a past state or event in a formal or literary
    style. This is a common way to form the past tense of a noun or na-adjective with であろう, as であろう typically
    follows plain forms, and であった is the plain past of である。

details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used in writing and formal speech only. Expresses the speaker's conjecture or certainty
    about a potential or existing state. Often used with non-controllable verbs or to express what is
    natural or expected.
  grammatical-role: modal auxiliary
  logical-flow: inference
  temporal-flow: present/future conjecture
etymology: The grammar point 「であろう」 originates from the classical Japanese auxiliary verb 「む」 (mu), which
  expressed conjecture, intention, or purpose. Over time, it evolved and converged with the volitional
  form of verbs (e.g., 行かむ → 行こう). Its connection to 「言う(いう)」 (iu) (to say) is a common misunderstanding;
  while 「言う」 expresses direct verbalization, 「よう」 in this context has primarily functioned as a modal
  auxiliary for conjecture and suggestion.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「であろう」 expresses conjecture, high probability, or what is natural to expect. It is frequently used in written language and formal speech, lending a more formal and literary tone compared to its modern counterpart 「だろう」.

  Here are its primary usages:

  *   **Verb (plain form) + であろう**: This is used with verbs (including potential, negative, and past forms) to indicate likelihood or possibility. 「であろう」 often carries a slightly stronger sense of certainty or a more detached, analytical tone.

  *   **I-Adjective (plain form) + であろう**: A more regular formal expression is to attach 「であろう」 to the plain form of the i-adjective, like 「苦しいであろう」.

  *   **Noun / な-Adjective (stem) + であろう**: This form is used with nouns and な-adjectives to express a likely or certain state of being. For instance, 「便利であろう」 (benri de arou) suggests that something is probably or must be convenient, often presented as an objective assessment.

  *   **Past Copula (であった) + であろう**: When conjecturing about a past state involving a noun or な-adjective, 「であったであろう」 (de atta de arou) is used. This combines the past form of the formal copula 「である」 (de aru) with 「であろう」, allowing for formal, reasoned conjectures about past conditions.

  **Important Considerations**:

  *   「であろう」 is significantly more formal and literary than 「だろう」. It is rarely heard in casual conversation in modern Japanese, making it primarily a feature of written communication, academic discourse, or very formal speeches.
  *   It often conveys a sense of logical conclusion or inherent truth, rather than a mere guess. This makes it suitable when discussing general principles or outcomes that are presented as self-evident.
  *   While it shares semantic overlap with 「だろう」, the choice between them largely depends on the desired register and formality. In contemporary spoken Japanese, 「だろう」 is overwhelmingly more common for expressing conjecture.
false_friends:
  - term: だろう
    meaning: probably, I think, isn't it?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だろう」 is functionally similar to 「であろう」 in expressing conjecture, but it is much more common
      in casual conversation and less formal writing. It can also carry an interrogative nuance, seeking
      confirmation, which 「であろう」 typically does not.
    grammar_point: だろう (conjecture)
  - term: でしょう
    meaning: probably, I think, right?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「でしょう」 is the polite form of 「だろう」. While 「であろう」 is formal and often literary, 「でしょう」 is polite
      and commonly used in spoken language and polite writing for expressing conjecture, seeking confirmation,
      or softening statements.
    grammar_point: でしょう (conjecture and confirmation)
  - term: に違いない
    meaning: must be, I'm sure that...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に違いない」 expresses a stronger degree of certainty or conviction than 「であろう」. While 「であろう」 suggests
      likelihood or probability, 「に違いない」 implies that there is little to no doubt about the conclusion.
    grammar_point: に違いない (no doubt)
  - term: はずだ
    meaning: it should be, it is expected that...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「はずだ」 indicates an expectation or strong probability based on known facts, reasons, or common
      knowledge. While 「であろう」 expresses general conjecture, 「はずだ」 implies a more grounded expectation.
    grammar_point: はずだ (expected to be)
  - term: かもしれない
    meaning: might, maybe, probably
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「であろう」 conveys a strong likelihood based on logic or objective assessment, 「かもしれない」
      expresses a weaker possibility or uncertainty. It's more about "it might be the case" rather than
      "it should logically be the case."
    grammar_point: かもしれない (might)
  - term: らしい
    meaning: appears to be, seems (based on hearsay or evidence)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「らしい」 indicates that the speaker's conjecture is based on external information, hearsay, or
      visible evidence, giving it a sense of "it seems like" or "I hear that." 「であろう」, in contrast, often
      implies a more internal, logical deduction or an objective statement of probability, regardless
      of direct external evidence.
    grammar_point: らしい (I hear, it seems)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「であろう」, 「だろう」, 「でしょう」, 「に違いない」, 「はずだ」, 「かもしれない」, and 「らしい」 all express
  some form of likelihood or conjecture, they differ significantly in their nuance, formality, and the
  degree of certainty they convey. Choosing the correct expression depends heavily on the context, desired
  level of formality, and the speaker's confidence in the conjecture. 「であろう」 is the most formal and literary,
  primarily found in written or highly formal spoken contexts, conveying a logical or objective conclusion.
  「だろう」 is its casual counterpart, frequently used in everyday conversation. 「でしょう」 is the polite form
  of 「だろう」, suitable for polite conversation and writing. 「に違いない」 expresses a much stronger certainty,
  implying little to no doubt. 「はずだ」 denotes an expectation based on known information or reasons. In
  contrast, 「かもしれない」 expresses a weaker, more speculative possibility, and 「らしい」 indicates conjecture
  based on external information or observation.

        hint: The reflection on a historical past requires a contemplative and literary tone, not a casual
