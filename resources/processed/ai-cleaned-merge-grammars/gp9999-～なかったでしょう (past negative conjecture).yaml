jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  function: expresses conjecture about a past negative event or state
  nuance: Indicates a speaker's strong inference or speculation that something did not happen or was not
    the case. It often conveys a sense of high probability of non-occurrence, sometimes with a nuance
    of mild surprise or an expectation that aligns with the negative outcome. It implies a logical deduction
    based on available information or general knowledge.
etymology: This grammatical construction combines the plain past negative form of verbs and adjectives
  (～なかった) with the polite conjectural auxiliary verb でしょう. The ～なかった form itself is a contraction of ～ない
  (negative) and ～あった (past existence/state). でしょう is the polite form of だろう, which conveys supposition
  or probability. Thus, ～なかったでしょう literally means something like 'it probably was not the case that (something
  happened/was).' It represents a speaker's logical deduction about a past negative event or state.
writeup: |-
  The grammar pattern **～なかったでしょう** is used to express a speaker's conjecture or strong assumption that something **probably did not happen** or **was not the case** in the past. It conveys a high degree of certainty or a strong inference that an action or state was negative.

  This form is highly versatile and can be used with verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns by first conjugating them into their plain negative past form and then attaching **でしょう**.

  **Key Characteristics:**

  *   **Polite Conjecture:** While the core forms are plain, the addition of **でしょう** makes the overall expression polite. It can be used in both formal and semi-formal contexts.
  *   **Logical Deduction:** The speaker often bases their conjecture on a logical deduction from observed circumstances, prior knowledge, or general common sense. It's not merely a guess, but an informed assumption.
  *   **Nuance of Expectation:** Sometimes, it can carry a nuance of an expectation that aligns with the negative outcome.
false_friends:
  - term: まい
    meaning: Won't, probably not, intend not to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express negative conjecture, 「まい」 is a stronger, more definite negation, often
      carrying a nuance of determination or archaic formality. 「～なかったでしょう」 is a softer, more probable
      conjecture. We're looking for a softer conjecture.
    grammar_point: まい (won't・probably not)
  - term: はずがない
    meaning: There's no way, cannot be, highly unlikely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「はずがない」 expresses logical impossibility or an extremely high degree of certainty that something
      is NOT the case, almost a logical deduction. 「～なかったでしょう」 suggests probability or likelihood of non-occurrence,
      but allows for a small possibility of the contrary. We're looking for probability, not impossibility.
    grammar_point: '[Clause]はずだ・はずがない (is expected to be・cannot be)'
  - term: わけがない
    meaning: No way, impossible, cannot be
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「はずがない」, 「わけがない」 denotes an absolute impossibility or strong logical denial. It's
      often used with an emotional emphasis on the unlikeliness. 「～なかったでしょう」 simply states a strong probability
      of non-occurrence. We're looking for a high probability, not an impossibility.
    grammar_point: わけがない (no way)
post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  When distinguishing between **～なかったでしょう** and similar expressions like **まい**, **はずがない**, or **わけがない**, consider the degree of certainty and the underlying reason for the negative conclusion.

  **～なかったでしょう** implies a high probability that something did not occur, often based on circumstantial evidence or general expectation. It leaves a slight margin of doubt.

  **まい** provides a stronger, more definitive negative conjecture, sometimes even expressing the speaker's personal resolve not to do something or a strong prediction of non-occurrence, often with a slightly formal or archaic feel.

  **はずがない** and **わけがない** express a near-absolute certainty that something *could not have happened* or *cannot be true*, based on logical reasoning or undeniable facts. They convey a sense of impossibility rather than mere improbability. Therefore, if you are making an informed guess about a past negative event, **～なかったでしょう** is suitable. If you are stating a logical impossibility, **はずがない** or **わけがない** would be more appropriate.
examples:
  - english: She probably didn't come because of the heavy rain.
    japanese:
      - 大雨 だっ た の で、彼女 は {来 なかっ た でしょう}。
      - 大雨 だっ た の で、彼女 は {来 なかっ た でしょう ね}。
    english_literally: Because it was heavy rain, she probably did not come.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 大雨 だっ た の で、彼女 は {来 ない はず が ない}。
        english: Because it was heavy rain, there's no way she didn't come (meaning she must have come).
        hint: 「～はずがない」 expresses logical impossibility in the opposite sense. We're conjecturing that
          she didn't come, not that it's impossible she didn't come.
    scene: You and a friend were supposed to meet another friend, but it started raining heavily. Your
      friend didn't show up.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: casual slang
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    nuance: This sentence uses the past negative of a verb (来なかった) combined with でしょう to express a polite
      conjecture about a past event. The use of 「大雨 だったので」 provides the logical basis for the conjecture,
      making the listener understand the reason for the high probability of her not coming. The politeness
      of でしょう makes it suitable for addressing a friend or acquaintance.
  - english: The test wasn't easy, so most students probably didn't get high scores.
    japanese:
      - 試験 は 簡単 じゃ なかっ た の で、ほとんど の 学生 は 高い 点 を {取れ なかっ た でしょう}。
      - ほとんど の 学生 は、高い 点 を {取れ なかっ た でしょう ね}。
    english_literally: The test was not easy, so most students probably could not get high scores.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 試験 は 簡単 じゃ なかっ た の で、ほとんど の 学生 は 高い 点 を {取れ ない だろう}。
        english: The test wasn't easy, so most students probably didn't get high scores (casual).
        hint: 「だろう」 is the casual form of 「でしょう」. We are practicing the polite form here.
    scene: A teacher is discussing the results of a difficult exam with a colleague.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: academic
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    nuance: Here, 「取れなかった」 is the potential form in the past negative. Combining it with 「でしょう」 expresses
      a polite conjecture that it was difficult for students to achieve high scores. The phrase 「ほとんど
      の 学生」 makes the conjecture more general, suggesting a shared understanding of the difficulty. This
      polite form is appropriate for academic or professional discussions.
  - english: She probably wasn't happy about that decision.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は その 決定 に {嬉しく なかっ た でしょう}。
      - 彼女 は その 決定 に は、{嬉しく なかっ た でしょう ね}。
    english_literally: As for her, to that decision, probably was not happy.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は その 決定 に {嬉しく ない はず が ない}。
        english: She couldn't have not been happy about that decision (meaning she must have been happy).
        hint: 「～ないはずがない」 implies a logical certainty of a positive outcome. We're conveying a probable
          negative emotional state.
    scene: Two colleagues are talking about a recent company decision that might have upset a third colleague.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    nuance: This example uses an い-adjective in its past negative form 「嬉しくなかった」. The sentence conveys
      a polite conjecture about someone's emotional state, implying empathy or understanding of why they
      might not have been happy. The polite ending 「でしょう」 keeps the tone respectful, even when discussing
      someone's feelings.
  - english: The food last night probably wasn't very tasty, was it?
    japanese:
      - 昨日 の 料理 は あまり {美味しく なかっ た でしょう}？
      - 昨日 の 料理、あまり {美味しく なかっ た でしょう ね}？
    english_literally: Yesterday's food was not very delicious, was it?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昨日 の 料理 は あまり {美味しく なかっ た はず だ}。
        english: Yesterday's food definitely wasn't very tasty (strong certainty).
        hint: 「はずだ」 expresses strong certainty, while 「でしょう」 here is used to seek agreement or soften
          the statement, turning it into a question.
    scene: You're catching up with a friend about a party you both attended where the food was notoriously
      bad.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    nuance: Adding a rising intonation to 「でしょう」 turns it into a question, seeking confirmation. This
      is a common polite way to ask for agreement on a conjecture. 「美味しくなかった」 is the past negative of
      an い-adjective. The use of 「あまり」 (not very) softens the negative description.
  - english: He probably wasn't serious when he said that.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は それ を 言っ た 時、{真面目 じゃ なかっ た でしょう}。
      - 彼 が それ を 言っ た 時 は、{真面目 じゃ なかっ た でしょう ね}。
    english_literally: As for him, when he said that, probably was not serious.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は それ を 言っ た 時、{真面目 で は ない でしょう}。
        english: He probably isn't serious when he says that (present conjecture).
        hint: This is a present tense conjecture. We are talking about a past event.
    scene: Two friends are discussing a third friend's questionable comment.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: casual slang
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    nuance: This sentence uses a な-adjective in its past negative form 「真面目じゃなかった」. The conjecture expressed
      by 「でしょう」 is about a past state of being. The nuance suggests that the speaker believes the statement
      was made in jest or without genuine intent, offering an explanation for the listener. The polite
      ending maintains a respectful tone between speakers.
  - english: The meeting probably didn't go well because the manager looked upset.
    japanese:
      - 部 長 の 顔 を 見る と、会議 は {うまく いか なかっ た でしょう}。
      - 部 長 の 顔 を 見る と、会議 は {うまく いか なかっ た でしょう ね}。
    english_literally: Seeing the manager's face, the meeting probably did not go well.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 部 長 の 顔 を 見る と、会議 は {うまく いか ない まい}。
        english: Seeing the manager's face, the meeting probably won't go well (future, stronger negative
          conjecture).
        hint: 「まい」 is typically used for future negative conjecture, and is stronger. We're discussing
          a past event.
    scene: Two coworkers observe their boss's demeanor after a meeting.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    nuance: 「うまくいかなかった」 is the negative past form of the verb. This sentence exemplifies using **～なかったでしょう**
      to draw a polite conclusion based on an observation. The speaker infers the negative outcome of
      the meeting from the manager's appearance, conveying this inference politely to their colleague.
      The use of 「見る と」 (upon seeing) highlights the trigger for the conjecture.
  - english: It probably wasn't a good idea to tell him the truth then.
    japanese:
      - あの 時、彼 に 本当 の こと を {言わ ない ほう が よかっ た でしょう}。
      - あの 時、彼 に 本当 の こと を {言わ ない ほう が よかっ た でしょう ね}。
    english_literally: At that time, to him, the truth, probably it would have been better not to say.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 時、彼 に 本当 の こと を {言わ ない ほう が よかっ た はず だ}。
        english: At that time, it definitely would have been better not to tell him the truth (stronger
          certainty).
        hint: 「はずだ」 expresses a stronger logical certainty, whereas 「でしょう」 here makes it a softer, more
          reflective conjecture about a past decision.
    scene: A person is reflecting on a past difficult conversation they had.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    nuance: This sentence combines 「～ないほうがよかった」 (it would have been better not to do) with 「でしょう」 to express
      a polite and reflective conjecture about a past action that, in retrospect, was probably not the
      best choice. It implies a degree of regret or a lesson learned.
  - english: They probably weren't students yet at that time, were they?
    japanese:
      - あの 時 は、彼 ら は まだ {学生 じゃ なかっ た でしょう}？
      - 彼 ら、あの 時 は まだ {学生 じゃ なかっ た でしょう ね}？
    english_literally: At that time, as for them, still probably were not students?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 時 は、彼 ら は まだ {学生 で は なかっ た}。
        english: At that time, they were not students (simple statement of fact).
        hint: This is a simple statement of fact. We're looking for a conjecture about a past state.
    scene: You're looking at old photos with a friend, trying to recall when certain people started attending
      school.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    nuance: This example uses a noun in its past negative form 「学生じゃなかった」, combined with 「でしょう」 as a question,
      seeking confirmation for a conjecture about a past status. The particle 「まだ」 (still) adds a nuance
      that they were likely young at that time, reinforcing the negative conjecture.
  - english: The reason for her absence probably wasn't a good one.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 の 欠席 の 理由 は {良く なかっ た でしょう}。
      - 彼女 の 欠席 の 理由 は、おそらく {良く なかっ た でしょう}。
    english_literally: Her absence's reason probably was not good.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 の 欠席 の 理由 は {良く ない でしょう}。
        english: The reason for her absence is probably not good (present conjecture).
        hint: This is a present tense conjecture. We are talking about a past event's reason.
    scene: Two managers are discussing an employee's unexpected absence.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    nuance: This sentence applies the pattern to an い-adjective 「良い」 (good) in its past negative form
      「良くなかった」. It expresses a polite, yet critical, conjecture about the quality or validity of a past
      reason. The formal context of the 'managers discussing' fits well with the polite 「でしょう」.
  - english: He probably didn't notice us there.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 私 たち に {気づか なかっ た でしょう}。
      - 彼 は 私 たち に は、{気づか なかっ た でしょう ね}。
    english_literally: As for him, to us, probably did not notice.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 私 たち に {気づか ない はず が ない}。
        english: There's no way he didn't notice us (meaning he must have noticed).
        hint: This expresses a logical impossibility of not noticing, implying he *did* notice. We're
          conveying a probability of *not* noticing.
    scene: You and a friend were hiding from someone, and you're wondering if you were seen.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: casual slang
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    nuance: This example uses a verb in its past negative form 「気づかなかった」. It expresses a polite conjecture
      about someone's lack of awareness in the past. The nuance can be relief (if they were trying to
      be unseen) or simple observation, depending on the context. 「でしょう」 maintains a polite and somewhat
      detached tone.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, **～なかったでしょう** is a versatile expression used to
  state a polite conjecture about a past negative state or action. It’s crucial to select the correct
  plain negative past form for the verb, い-adjective, な-adjective, or noun, as outlined in the 'Formation'
  section. The politeness of **でしょう** makes it suitable for a wide range of situations, from casual conversations
  with friends to more professional or academic discussions. Remember that while it conveys a high probability,
  it is still a conjecture, allowing for a degree of uncertainty.
