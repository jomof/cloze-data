        "part-of-speech": "adverb",
        "register": "formal",
        "function": "To indicate that something leads to a significant result or consequence, or to emphasize a connection between two related nouns.",
        "nuance": "Implies a cause-and-effect relationship where an action or event will have a cascading effect leading to a larger, more significant outcome.",

    },
    "etymology": "The term 「ひいては」 comes from the verb 「引く」 (hiku), meaning \"to pull\" or \"to draw.\" The 「ては」 (te wa) form adds a conditional nuance, suggesting that one action \"pulls\" or \"leads\" to another. It evolved to express the idea of something leading to a broader or more significant outcome.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「ひいては」 (hiite wa) indicates that something leads to a significant result or consequence, or emphasizes a connection between two related nouns. It is similar to \"eventually,\" \"and furthermore,\" or \"in turn.\" It implies a cause-and-effect relationship, where one action or event has a cascading effect, leading to a larger, more significant outcome. It's more emphatic than 「さらには」 (saraniwa), suggesting the result is inevitable. This expression is generally used in formal contexts.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene sets up a reflective and slightly formal tone, implying a natural and significant long-term consequence rather than just an additional point. 「ひいては」 emphasizes this progression more strongly than a simple 「そして」."

            "register": "formal",
            "setting": "reflective",
            "nuance": "The phrase 「つながり」 (tsunagari) indicates a connection, and 「ひいては」 then emphasizes that this connection leads to a significant, often inevitable, long-term outcome. The natural progression from improved language skills to new opportunities is highlighted."

            "japanese": "無責任 な 行動 は 信頼 を 失わせ、 {ひいては} 社会 的 信用 の 低下 に 繋がる。",

                    "mitigation": "The context of a manager's warning highlights the cascading, almost inevitable, negative impact of certain actions. 「ひいては」 is suitable here to imply this chain reaction more strongly than 「その結果」 (as a result), which might sound too direct or immediate for a long-term consequence."

            "setting": "serious",
            "nuance": "Here, 「ひいては」 is used to describe an undesirable but natural consequence of a negative action. The word 「繋がる」 (tsunagaru) again emphasizes the link, and 「ひいては」 implies that the decline in credibility is the broader, ultimate result of the lost trust."

                    "mitigation": "The scene emphasizes the expanding scope and impact of the problem. 「ひいては」 is used to bridge the specific (local community) to the general (entire nation), indicating that the local issue inherently leads to the national issue, rather than just adding another point with 「そして」."

The 「温かい言葉」 (kind words) not only healed the heart but ultimately led to the profound gift of 「生きる希望」 (hope to live). The use of this grammar point here emphasizes the transformative and far-reaching impact of the initial act. The younger speaker speaking to an older friend highlights the profound respect and trust, which 「ひいては」 naturally conveys."
