        "Register": "Formal",
        "Function": "To indicate that something leads to a significant result or consequence, or to emphasize a connection between two related nouns.",
        "Nuance": "Implies a cause-and-effect relationship where an action or event will have a cascading effect leading to a larger, more significant outcome.",
        "Common mistake": "Often confused with similar expressions like 「さらには」 (furthermore) but 「ひいては」 carries a stronger sense of consequence or eventual result."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「ひいては」 comes from the verb 「引く」 (hiku), meaning \"to pull\" or \"to draw.\" The 「ては」 (te wa) form adds a conditional nuance, suggesting that one action \"pulls\" or \"leads\" to another. It evolved to express the idea of something leading to a broader or more significant outcome.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「ひいては」 (hiite wa) indicates that something leads to a significant result or consequence, or emphasizes a connection between two related nouns. It is similar to \"eventually,\" \"and furthermore,\" or \"in turn.\" It implies a cause-and-effect relationship, where one action or event has a cascading effect, leading to a larger, more significant outcome. It's more emphatic than 「さらには」 (saraniwa), suggesting the result is inevitable.",
