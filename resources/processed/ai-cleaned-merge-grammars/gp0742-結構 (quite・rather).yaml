    positive assessment but can be used in negative contexts as well to indicate an unexpectedly large
    degree. Primarily used in conversational settings.
  function: To qualify the degree of an adjective or verb, implying a nuance of exceeding expectations,
    often surprisingly so.
  nuance: Carries a nuance of 'more than one might expect' or 'surprisingly', which can be positive or
    negative depending on the context. It can also imply sufficiency or acceptance when used as a polite
    refusal.

    緊張する (kinchou suru), 気に入る (ki ni iru).
etymology: The word 結構 (kekkou) originally comes from Buddhist terminology, meaning a well-constructed
  or complete state. It evolved to encompass meanings like "splendid" or "sufficient." In modern Japanese,
  it's used in various contexts, including to decline offers politely ("No, thank you") and as an adverb
  meaning "quite" or "rather," retaining the nuance of something being complete or satisfactory to a degree.
writeup: |-
  **結構 (kekkou)** is an adverbial expression used to indicate that something is “quite”, “rather”, or “pretty” good, large, or significant. It often carries a nuance of exceeding expectations, implying a certain level of surprise or unexpectedness. For example, if you say something is **結構** 面白い, it means it's 'surprisingly interesting' or 'more interesting than expected'. This nuance distinguishes it from simple intensifiers like とても or すごく.

  It is important to note that while versatile, 結構 is generally used in conversational settings rather than formal writing. While often positive, it can also be used in negative statements to express an unexpectedly high degree of something undesirable, such as **結構** 難しい ('surprisingly difficult') or **結構** 悪い ('quite bad', implying worse than anticipated). It can also be used as a standalone response to politely decline an offer, meaning 'No, thank you' or 'I'm fine as is,' carrying the nuance of 'sufficient' or 'complete.'
false_friends:
  - term: 大丈夫
    meaning: Okay; alright; safe; problem free
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 結構 can sometimes mean "okay" when declining something ("No, thank you"), 大丈夫 is a much
      broader term for general okayness, safety, or being problem-free. 結構 implies sufficiency or completeness
      in a specific context.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:大丈夫 (okay)
  - term: 素晴らしい
    meaning: Wonderful; amazing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 素晴らしい expresses strong admiration and high approval, indicating something exceptional. 結構,
      while often positive, indicates something being more than expected or satisfactory rather than necessarily
      amazing. It points to a surprising degree, not necessarily peak excellence.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:素晴らしい (wonderful)
  - term: かなり
    meaning: Considerably; fairly; quite
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both 結構 and かなり indicate a considerable degree. However, 結構 often has a nuance of exceeding
      expectations, implying a subjective element of surprise or satisfaction. かなり is more neutral and
      objective, simply stating a high degree without the added nuance of unexpectedness.
    grammar_point: かなり (quite・considerably)
  - term: とても
    meaning: Very; extremely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: とても is a simple intensifier meaning 'very' or 'extremely,' indicating a high degree without
      any additional nuance. 結構 implies that the degree is higher than anticipated, carrying a sense of
      surprise or unexpectedness that とても does not.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:とても (very)
  - term: すごく
    meaning: Very; really; terribly
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: すごく is a common and often emphatic intensifier meaning 'very' or 'really.' Like とても, it generally
      lacks the nuance of unexpectedness or exceeding expectations that 結構 conveys. すごく is more direct
      in its intensification.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:すごく (very)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 結構 emphasizes the degree to which something
  exceeds expectations or is surprisingly so. If you want to simply express that something is “okay” or
  “fine” in a general sense, use 大丈夫. For expressing strong admiration, 素晴らしい is more appropriate. When
  indicating a considerable degree without the nuance of exceeding expectations, かなり, とても, or すごく are
  suitable alternatives. The key is 結構's subjective sense of 'surprisingly' or 'more than expected.'
examples:
  - english: This restaurant is quite delicious considering the price.
    japanese:
      - この レストラン は、値段 の 割 に {結構} 美味しい ね。
      - この レストラン は、値段 の 割 に {結構} 美味しい です ね。
      - この レストラン、値段 の 割 に {結構} 美味しい ねぇ。
    english_literally: This restaurant, considering the price, is quite delicious, isn't it.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この レストラン は、値段 の 割 に とても 美味しい ね。
        english: This restaurant is very delicious considering the price.
        hint: とても simply means 'very' or 'extremely.' 『結構』, however, implies that the deliciousness was
          more than expected or satisfactory given the price. We're looking for a word that conveys an
          unexpected degree of deliciousness.
    scene: Two friends eating at a casual restaurant.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The use of 「ね」 is a sentence-ending particle that seeks agreement or confirmation from the
      listener, common in friendly conversations. The phrase 「値段の割に」 sets up the expectation for something
      to be average, making the use of 「結構」 especially apt as it conveys that the food's deliciousness
      is surprisingly high given its price point.
  - english: This anime has average art, but it's actually quite interesting.
    japanese:
      - この アニメ、絵 は 普通 だ けど {結構} 面白い よ。
      - この アニメ、絵 は 普通 です けど {結構} 面白い です よ。
      - この アニメ、絵 普通 だ けど さ、{結構} 面白い よ ね。
    english_literally: This anime, the art is average but it's quite interesting, you know.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この アニメ、絵 は 普通 だ けど すごく 面白い よ。
        english: This anime has average art, but it's very interesting.
        hint: すごく means 'very' or 'really,' indicating a high degree. 『結構』, on the other hand, suggests
          that it's interesting despite the average art, implying an unexpected level of interest. We're
          looking for a word that conveys an unexpected degree of interestingness.
    scene: Recommending an anime to a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「よ」 is a particle used to inform the listener of something new or to emphasize the speaker's
      statement, making it suitable for recommendations. The opening phrase 「絵は普通だけど」 sets up the expectation
      for the anime to be unremarkable visually, which is then contrasted by 「結構面白い」, highlighting that
      its interestingness exceeds what one might expect from its appearance.
  - english: It's my first time today, so I'm actually quite nervous.
    japanese:
      - 今日 は 初めて だ けど、{結構} 緊張 し てる ん だ。
      - 今日 は 初めて です けど、{結構} 緊張 し てる ん です。
      - 今日 初めて だ から、{結構} 緊張 し ちゃう よ。

          - 今日 は 初めて だ けど、すごく 緊張 し てる ん だ。
        english: It's my first time today, so I'm very nervous.
        hint: すごく means 'very,' stating a high degree of nervousness. 『結構』 here suggests that the nervousness
          is more than what might be typical or expected for a first time, adding a nuance of 'surprisingly'
          or 'unexpectedly.' We're looking for a word that conveys an unexpected degree of nervousness.
    scene: A person confessing to being nervous before a presentation.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 「～んだ」 in this context, combined with the male speaker, implies a slightly more
      direct and personal expression of feeling or explanation. While not exclusively male, its usage
      here contributes to a natural male conversational tone in a moment of personal confession. The speaker
      uses 「結構」 to emphasize that the level of nervousness is surprisingly high, perhaps even to himself,
      given the circumstances.
  - english: This job looks easy, but it's actually quite tough, you know.
    japanese:
      - この 仕事、簡単 そう に 見える けど、{結構} 大変 な ん です よ。

        english: This job looks easy, but it's very tough, you know.
        hint: とても simply means 'very,' stating a high degree of difficulty. 『結構』 emphasizes that the job
          is tough to an unexpected degree, contrasting with its easy appearance. We're looking for a
          word that conveys an unexpected level of toughness.
    scene: An older, experienced employee explaining the realities of their job to a younger colleague.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The combination of 「～んです」 (explanatory form) and 「～ですよ」 (polite assertion/emphasis) is common
      when an older speaker explains something to a younger one, giving advice or clarifying a misconception.
      「結構」 here conveys that the difficulty is surprisingly high, directly contradicting the initial perception
      of it being easy. This nuanced explanation is characteristic of someone with experience sharing
      insight.
  - english: This outfit has a simple design, but it was actually quite expensive, you know.

        english: This outfit has a simple design, but it was very expensive, you know.
        hint: すごく means 'very,' indicating a high price. 『結構』, in this context, highlights that the price
          was surprisingly high despite the simple design. We're looking for a word that conveys an unexpectedly
          high price.
    scene: Two friends discussing a recent purchase.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「～んだよ」 adds a casual, explanatory tone, common in informal conversation, indicating a slightly
      surprising fact about the purchase price given the simple design. The speaker uses 「結構」 to emphasize
      this unexpected expense, conveying that the cost was higher than what one might assume from its
      appearance.
  - english: Could it be that you actually like me quite a bit?
    japanese:
      - もし か し て 君、{結構} 僕 の こと 気 に 入っ てる？
      - もし か し て 君、{結構} 僕 の こと 気 に 入っ てる の？
    english_literally: Could it be you, you actually like me quite a bit?

      - competing_japanese:
          - もし か し て 君、すごく 僕 の こと 気 に 入っ てる？
        english: Could it be that you like me very much?
        hint: すごく means 'very much,' indicating a high degree of liking. 『結構』 implies that the liking
          is more than what was initially thought or expected, carrying a nuance of 'surprisingly' or
          'more than a little.' We're looking for a word that conveys an unexpected degree of liking.
    scene: A man teasingly probing a woman's feelings.
    register: casual
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The male speaker's use of 「君 (kimi)」 towards a female listener often implies a degree of intimacy,
      playfulness, or even mild condescension, depending on context. Coupled with 「僕 (boku)」, a common
      male pronoun, it establishes a distinctly male-to-female conversational dynamic. The use of 「結構」
      here softens the directness of the question while still probing her feelings, implying 'more than
      a little' or 'surprisingly' much.
  - english: The test questions were actually quite difficult.
    japanese:

        english: The test questions were very difficult.
        hint: とても simply expresses a high degree of skill. 『結構』 implies that the difficulty was surprisingly
          high, perhaps unexpectedly so after preparing or based on previous tests. We're looking for
          a word that conveys an unexpected degree of difficulty.
    scene: A student discussing a recent exam with a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: academic
    nuance: The particle 「よ」 at the end emphasizes the speaker's statement, making it sound like they
      are sharing a somewhat surprising observation. The use of 「結構」 reinforces this by implying that
      the questions were harder than they or perhaps others had anticipated, contrasting with a general
      expectation of difficulty.
  - english: It's quite a long way from here to the station, isn't it?
    japanese:

          - ここ から 駅 まで かなり 遠い ね。
        english: It's considerably far from here to the station, isn't it?
        hint: かなり is a neutral intensifier. 『結構』 carries the nuance that the distance is surprisingly
          or unexpectedly far, perhaps more than one would initially assume. We're looking for a word
          that conveys an unexpected distance.
    scene: Someone realizing the distance to the station after getting off a bus.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: The sentence-ending particle 「ね」 is used here to seek agreement from the listener, implying

    scene: Someone recounting their experience at an outdoor event during bad weather.

      encouraging atmosphere. 「結構」 here conveys that the student's progress is not just 'good' but surprisingly
      good, perhaps exceeding expectations, which is a very encouraging sentiment from a teacher. The
      「ね」 seeks confirmation and expresses shared positive feeling.

      conveys that the game's popularity among children is surprisingly high, perhaps beyond what they
      might have expected for a new release. This suggests a slightly unexpected but positive outcome.
post_example_writeup: As these examples illustrate, 結構 is a versatile adverb that adds a nuanced layer
  of 'more than expected' or 'surprisingly' to adjectives and verbs. It is particularly effective when
  you want to highlight a contrast between initial perception and reality, making it a powerful tool for
  conveying subtle subjective impressions in conversational Japanese.
