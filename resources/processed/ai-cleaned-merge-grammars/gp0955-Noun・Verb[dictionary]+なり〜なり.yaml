    "etymology": "The particle 「なり」 comes from the classical Japanese word 「也」 (ya), which originally denoted assertion or emphasis. Over time, it evolved to indicate options or possibilities when used in pairs.",
    "writeup": "The classical adverbial particle 「なり」, when used in lists, indicates that each item in the list is a possibility, and one of them will or needs to be chosen. 「AなりBなり」 indicates that either A or B is acceptable, implying that anything else within that category is likely also fine. Therefore, it's a non-exhaustive list.\n\n「なり」 is a fairly polite construction and follows verbs in their dictionary form or nouns. In cases where a particle provides essential information related to the choice, 「なり」 will follow that particle (e.g., 「場所に」 for location).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\nThis structure emphasizes presenting a list from which something will be chosen, differentiating it from similar structures like 「など」 and 「や」. Consequently, 「なり」 is not used to mean \"such as\" but only for \"either, or\" statements.",
