    "etymology": "The particle 「なり」 originally indicated something that is in its natural or original state. In this grammar point, it's used to present alternatives in a non-exhaustive list. The repetition of 「なり」 emphasizes the 'either... or' nature of the choices.",
    "writeup": "The 「なり〜なり」 construction presents a non-exhaustive list of options, indicating that one of the listed items will be chosen, but also implying that similar options are acceptable. It translates to \"either... or\" and is considered fairly polite. It connects nouns directly, or verbs in their dictionary form. It cannot follow the particles 「が」 or 「を」. It differs from similar structures like 「など」 and 「や」 by emphasizing a choice between the listed items, rather than simply listing examples.",
