        "Usage": "Primarily used in writing and formal speech"

    "etymology": "The grammar point 「と共に」 is derived from the noun 「共 (tomo)」 meaning \"together,\" combined with the particle 「と (to)」 indicating accompaniment or simultaneity, and the case-marking particle 「に (ni)」. The combination creates an adverbial phrase that indicates a shared state, action, or quality.",
    "writeup": "**と共に (to tomo ni)** expresses the idea of things happening simultaneously, or of sharing a common property. It can be translated as \"together with,\" \"at the same time as,\" or \"as well as.\" It's often used in more formal writing and speech. You'll see it after nouns, verbs in dictionary form, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives (often with \"である\"). It indicates that two things exist or occur in conjunction with each other. Pay attention to the context to understand the specific nuance.",

                    "mitigation": "「につれて」 emphasizes a continuous change over time, whereas 「と共に」 can also imply a correlation or accompaniment. The scene focuses on the natural progression of aging where the weakening body accompanies the increase in age, making 「と共に」 a more direct and natural fit for 'accompanying' change."

                {
                    "competing_grammar": "年を取るに伴って、体が動きにくくなる。",
                    "mitigation": "「に伴って」 often suggests a more formal or cause-and-effect relationship, commonly used in academic or professional contexts. The scene of personal reflection on aging is more naturally expressed with 「と共に」, which conveys the two phenomena occurring simultaneously in a less rigid way."
