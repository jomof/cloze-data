    "etymology": "The grammar point 「と共に」 is derived from the noun 「共 (tomo)」 meaning \"together,\" combined with the particle 「と (to)」 indicating accompaniment or simultaneity, and the case-marking particle 「に (ni)」. The combination creates an adverbial phrase that indicates a shared state, action, or quality.",
    "writeup": "**と共に (to tomoni)** expresses the idea of things happening simultaneously, or of sharing a common property. It can be translated as \"together with,\" \"at the same time as,\" or \"as well as.\" It's often used in more formal writing and speech. You'll see it after nouns, verbs in dictionary form, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives (often with \"である\"). It indicates that two things exist or occur in conjunction with each other. Pay attention to the context to understand the specific nuance.",

                    "mitigation": "「につれて」 emphasizes a proportional, continuous change over time. While applicable, the scene aims for a broader reflection on growth occurring *with* the passage of time, where 「と共に」 more naturally conveys this general accompaniment without strictly defining proportionality."
