id: gp9999
meaning: for the first time in a long time; after a long absence
pronunciation:
  katakana: ヒサシブリニ
  romaji: hisashiburi ni
formation:
  久しぶり + に: Indicates an action or event occurring after a long interval.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The expression combines the noun 久しぶり (hisashiburi), which literally means 'long time since,'
  with the particle に (ni). 久し (hisashi) derives from a classical adjective meaning 'long (time),' and
  ぶり (buri) is a suffix indicating 'after an interval of.' The particle に marks the circumstance or timing
  of the action, signifying that something is being done 'in a long-time-since manner' or 'after a long
  interval.'
writeup: |-
  The phrase **久しぶりに** (hisashiburi ni) is used to describe an action or event that is happening again after a long period of time. It conveys a sense of something being long-awaited or feeling fresh because of the extended interval since its last occurrence. It is commonly used in both casual and formal contexts, though its inherent nuance often lends itself to more personal or conversational situations.

  This expression typically modifies a verb, indicating that the action described by the verb is being performed 'for the first time in a long time' or 'after a long absence.' The 'long time' implied by **久しぶりに** is subjective and can vary, but it always suggests a duration significant enough to warrant mention.

  While **久しぶりに** is generally used in positive or neutral contexts, expressing a pleasant return to an activity or a reunion, it can also be used objectively without strong emotional connotation simply to state a fact about elapsed time. It is versatile and frequently appears in daily conversation, making it a fundamental phrase for discussing past intervals and current actions.

  - term: 久しぶり！
    meaning: Long time no see! (greeting)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While using the same base noun, this is a standalone interjection used as a greeting when
      encountering someone after a long time. It does not grammatically modify a verb or action.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:久しぶり (greeting)
  - term: X年ぶり
    meaning: for the first time in X years / after an X-year interval
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This construction explicitly states the specific duration (X years, X months, etc.) that has
      passed, providing a precise numerical interval. **久しぶりに** is more general, simply implying 'a long
      time' without specifying the exact period, and often carries a stronger emotional or subjective
      sense of long-awaitedness.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Noun+ぶり (after an interval of)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing **久しぶりに** from similar expressions, remember that **久しぶりに**
  emphasizes the *feeling* or *perception* of a long time having passed before an action, often with a
  nuance of pleasant anticipation or novelty. In contrast, **久しぶり！** is strictly a greeting, and constructions
  like **X年ぶり** provide a precise, objective measurement of the elapsed time rather than a subjective
  feeling.
