formation:

jlpt: N5
etymology: The word 大変 (たいへん) literally combines 大 (dai, 'big, great') and 変 (hen, 'change, unusual').
  Originally, it meant 'a great change' or 'an emergency/calamity.' Over time, its usage evolved to express
  the intensity or severity of a situation, leading to its modern adverbial meaning of 'very' or 'extremely,'
  and its adjectival meaning of 'difficult' or 'serious.' The exclamatory '大変！' directly reflects its
  original sense of 'It's serious!' or 'An emergency!'
writeup: The word 大変 (たいへん) is versatile in Japanese, primarily functioning as an **adverb** meaning 'very'
  or 'extremely,' but it can also act as a **な-adjective** meaning 'difficult,' 'serious,' or 'tremendous,'
  and even as an **interjection** to express alarm or urgency. As an **adverb**, 大変 intensifies the meaning
  of the word it modifies, similar to English 'very' or 'extremely.' For example, 大変きれい (たいへんきれい) means
  'very beautiful,' and 大変よくできました (たいへんよくできました) means 'You did extremely well.' It is generally neutral
  in tone, though perhaps slightly more formal or emphatic than すごく (sugoku) in adverbial use. When used
  as a **な-adjective**, 大変な (たいへんな) describes a noun as being difficult, serious, or extraordinary. For
  instance, 大変な仕事 (たいへんなしごと) refers to 'a difficult job' or 'a tremendous amount of work,' and 大変なこと (たいへんなこと)
  can mean 'a serious matter.' Finally, as an **interjection**, 大変！ (たいへん！) is used as an exclamation
  to signal a sudden emergency, a serious problem, or something urgent. It conveys a sense of alarm or
  immediate need for attention. For example, if something unexpected and negative happens, one might exclaim
  '大変！' Understanding the historical progression from 'great change/emergency' to 'serious/difficult'
  and then to 'very' helps grasp its various modern applications. The nuance often depends on context
  and the word it modifies.

  - term: とても
    meaning: very
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: とても primarily means "very" or "extremely" and generally implies a positive or neutral intensity.
      It does not carry the connotation of "difficulty" or "seriousness" that たいへん can.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:とても (very)
  - term: すごく
    meaning: very; greatly
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: すごく is a more casual and conversational way to express "very" or "greatly." While たいへん can
      be used casually, すごく is typically favored in informal settings. すごく does not carry the nuance of
      "difficulty" or "serious situation."
    grammar_point: <suggest>:すごく (very)
  - term: かなり
    meaning: quite; considerably
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: かなり indicates a degree that is "quite" high or "considerable" but is generally less intense
      than たいへん, とても, or すごく. It often implies a subjective judgment that something is "fairly" good or
      "fairly" difficult, rather than "extremely."
    grammar_point: かなり (quite・considerably)
  - term: 大変だ
    meaning: It's serious!; It's tough!; Oh no!
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: This is the adjectival/interjectional use of the same word, 大変. While the adverb たいへん intensifies
      an adjective or verb, 大変だ describes a situation as difficult, serious, or expresses alarm as an
      exclamation.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:大変だ (it's serious)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between たいへん, とても, すごく, and かなり, consider the nuance of intensity
  and formality. たいへん offers flexibility, allowing it to function as a polite intensifier, a descriptor
  for difficult situations, or an urgent exclamation. とても is a reliable, generally neutral intensifier
  for 'very.' すごく leans more casual, suitable for everyday conversation. かなり softens the intensity, implying
  'quite' rather than 'extremely.' Furthermore, remember that 大変だ (たいへんだ) is grammatically different from
  the adverbial たいへん; it functions as a な-adjective or an interjection to convey seriousness or difficulty
  about a situation itself, rather than merely intensifying an attribute.
