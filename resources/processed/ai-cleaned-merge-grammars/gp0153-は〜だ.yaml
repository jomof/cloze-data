    "writeup": "The grammar point 「**は〜だ**」 is a fundamental sentence structure in Japanese used to identify a topic and provide information about it. 「は」 marks the topic, and 「だ」 (or its polite form 「です」) acts as a copula, similar to \"is\" or \"are\" in English. This structure is commonly used with nouns and *na*-adjectives. The choice between 「だ」 and 「です」 depends on the level of politeness required. 「だ」 is casual, while 「です」 is polite. Other forms include: 「だった」 (past casual), 「でした」 (past polite), and their negative counterparts.",

    ],
    "etymology": "「は」 is a particle that marks the topic of the sentence. 「だ」 is a copula derived from the archaic verb 「なり」, which meant \"to be.\" Over time, 「なり」 evolved into 「だ」, serving as a simpler way to express existence or equation. 「です」 is the polite form of 「だ」, derived from 「であります」."
