It's often translated as \"probably,\" \"right?\" or \"isn't it?\" in English. It's a polite form, and it indicates the speaker has some reason to believe what they are saying is true, but is not entirely certain. Consider it a polite way of making an assertion while inviting agreement.\n\nGenerally, でしょう follows the plain form of verbs and adjectives. However, in very formal contexts, or older literature, 〜ます でしょう may be seen.\n\nThe more casual contraction of でしょう is でしょ. Use this when speaking with close friends or family.",
