    "etymology": "でしょう is derived from the copula です (desu), which indicates a state of being or identity. The suffix しょう (shō) is added to です to express conjecture, intention, or invitation in a polite manner. Over time, ですしょう contracted into でしょう.",
    "writeup": "でしょう is a polite expression used to express **uncertainty, conjecture, or to seek confirmation** from the listener. It's often translated as \"probably,\" \"right?\" or \"isn't it?\" in English. It's a polite form, and it indicates the speaker has some reason to believe what they are saying is true, but is not entirely certain. Consider it a polite way of making an assertion while inviting agreement.\n\n*   Generally, でしょう follows the plain form of verbs and adjectives. However, in very formal contexts, you might encounter 〜ますでしょう, though this is less common.\n\n*   The more casual contraction of でしょう is でしょ. Use this when speaking with close friends or family.",
