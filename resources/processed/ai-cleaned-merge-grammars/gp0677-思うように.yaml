    "etymology": "The phrase 「思うように」 originates from the verb 「思う (omou)」 meaning \"to think,\" \"to feel,\" or \"to consider,\" combined with the auxiliary verb 「ようだ (you da)」 in its adverbial form 「ように (you ni)」. 「ようだ」 indicates resemblance, appearance, or manner. Thus, 「思うように」 literally means \"in the way that one thinks/feels,\" conveying the sense of something happening or not happening according to one's expectation or desire.",
    "writeup": "「思うように」 is a grammatical construction in Japanese used to describe whether a situation, action, or outcome aligns with one's expectations, desires, or thoughts. It literally translates to \"as one thinks/hopes\" or \"in the way one expects.\" This phrase is versatile and can be used in both positive and negative contexts, though it very commonly appears with negative outcomes to express frustration or disappointment when things do not proceed as planned. It highlights the discrepancy between one's internal projection and external reality.\n\n**Structure:**\n「思うように」 typically follows a clause that establishes the expectation or desired state. The phrase itself modifies the subsequent verb or adjective, describing how that action or state unfolds in relation to the expectation.\n\n*   **[Expectation/Desired State] + 思うように + [Outcome/Result]**\n\nFor instance, if one practices diligently but doesn't improve as quickly as anticipated, 「思うように」 would be used to express this gap. The phrase functions as an adverbial modifier, indicating the manner in which the main action or state occurs. It's important to note that while 「思う」 is the verb \"to think,\" in this specific grammatical pattern, it carries a strong nuance of \"to hope,\" \"to expect,\" or \"to wish.\"\n\n**Usage Nuances:**\n\n*   **Negative Contexts:** 「思うように」 is frequently paired with negative verbs or expressions to convey a sense of unfulfilled expectations. For example, 「思うように行かない (omou you ni ikanai)」 means \"things don't go as one hopes,\" and 「思うようにできない (omou you ni dekinai)」 means \"one can't do it as one wishes.\" This usage is very common when discussing setbacks or difficulties.\n*   **Positive Contexts:** While less frequent, 「思うように」 can also be used in positive contexts, indicating that things did indeed go exactly as planned or even better. However, for simply stating that something went well, other expressions might be more natural. 「思うように」 tends to emphasize the *match* between thought and reality.\n*   **Flexibility:** The phrase is relatively neutral in terms of social register and can be used in both casual and more formal settings.",

It's more about having absolute power over a situation. 「思うように」, by contrast, is often about the *outcome* matching an expectation, and frequently implies a lack of control when used negatively. 「意のままに」 carries a more active, assertive connotation."
