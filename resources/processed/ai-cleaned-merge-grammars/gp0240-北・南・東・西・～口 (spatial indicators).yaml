  romaji: kita, minami, higashi, nishi, ~guchi
  pronunciation_warning: The pronunciation of ～口 (kuchi) often changes to ～ぐち (guchi) due to rendaku,
    a common Japanese sound change phenomenon, especially when preceded by certain kanji or sounds, such
    as those ending in a vowel or 'n'.
formation:
  北/南/東/西 + の + noun: Indicates the general direction or location relative to something.
  北/南/東/西 + に/へ + verb of movement: Indicates movement towards a specific direction.
  北/南/東/西 + direction + noun: Specifies a more precise location within a general direction (e.g., 北東 -
    northeast).

jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: noun
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Commonly used for giving directions, geographical descriptions, and general spatial orientation.
  function: To indicate cardinal directions and specific entrances/exits.
  nuance: While the basic meanings are straightforward, the use of ～口 is very common in urban settings
    for navigation.
  grammatical-role: Can function as a noun, or with particles, as an adverbial phrase.
etymology: The kanji for the cardinal directions (北, 南, 東, 西) are ancient, stemming from pictographic
  or ideographic representations related to their respective positions or natural phenomena. For instance,
  東 (east) is said to represent the sun rising behind a tree. 西 (west) might depict a bird returning to
  its nest at sunset. 南 (south) and 北 (north) are also rooted in ancient Chinese characters. The suffix
  ～口 (kuchi/guchi) literally means 'mouth' and is extended to mean 'entrance' or 'exit', as in the 'mouth'
  of a passage.
writeup: The Japanese terms for the cardinal directions – **北** (kita), **南** (minami), **東** (higashi),
  and **西** (nishi) – are fundamental for spatial orientation and navigation. They are essential for describing
  locations, giving directions, and understanding geographical references. These terms are straightforward
  and widely used in everyday conversation, news, and official documents. They can be combined to form
  intermediate directions like **北東** (hokutō - northeast) or **南西** (nansē - southwest). Beyond simple
  directions, the suffix **～口** (guchi/kuchi) is critically important, especially in urban environments.
  It literally means "mouth" but is used to denote an "entrance" or "exit," most commonly seen at train
  stations or large buildings. For example, **東口** (higashiguchi) means "east exit," and **西口** (nishiguchi)
  means "west exit." Understanding these terms is vital for navigating Japan's public transportation system.
  The pronunciation of ～口 changes to ～ぐち (guchi) when preceded by certain sounds, such as those ending
  in a vowel or 'n', following a common Japanese sound change phenomenon called *rendaku* (連濁).

  - term: 方面 (hōmen)
    meaning: direction, area, side
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both refer to direction, **方面** (hōmen) indicates a general area or 'towards' a certain
      place, often with the nuance of a destination or a broader area. It's more about the destination
      or a broader area, whereas **北/南/東/西** refers to the exact cardinal direction.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:方面 (direction, area, side)
  - term: 方角 (hōgaku)
    meaning: direction, bearing
    kind: synonym
    nuance: '**方角** (hōgaku) is a more formal or technical term for ''direction'' or ''bearing,'' often
      used in navigation or geomancy. While it can be a synonym for the cardinal directions, the specific
      **北/南/東/西** are more commonly used for simple, direct directional references in everyday conversation.'

  - term: 通り (tōri)
    meaning: street, road
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: '**通り** (tōri) refers to a ''street'' or ''avenue'' itself, a physical path, not a direction.
      It is a common mistake for learners to confuse spatial navigation terms with names of physical routes.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:通り (street, road)
  - term: 入口 (iriguchi)
    meaning: entrance
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is a general term for 'entrance' without specifying a cardinal direction. It is a broader
      category, whereas **～口** with a cardinal direction specifies *which* entrance.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:入口 (entrance)
  - term: 出口 (deguchi)
    meaning: exit
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is a general term for 'exit' without specifying a cardinal direction. It is a broader
      category, whereas **～口** with a cardinal direction specifies *which* exit.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:出口 (exit)
  - term: 玄関 (genkan)
    meaning: entrance hall
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: '**玄関** refers to the entire entrance hall or foyer, whereas **玄関口** specifically refers to
      the physical ''mouth'' or opening of the entrance.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:玄関 (entrance hall)
  - term: 西方 (seihō)
    meaning: western direction
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '**西方** is a general geographical term referring to the western direction or region, distinct
      from the precise cardinal point **西** (nishi) or the specific side **西側** (nishigawa).'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:西方 (western direction)
  - term: 東方 (tōhō)
    meaning: eastern direction

    nuance: '**東方** is a general geographical term referring to the eastern direction or region, distinct
      from the precise cardinal point **東** (higashi).'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:東方 (eastern direction)
  - term: 北方 (hoppō)
    meaning: northern direction
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '**北方** is a general geographical term referring to the northern direction or region, distinct
      from the precise cardinal point **北** (kita) or the specific side **北側** (kitagawa).'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:北方 (northern direction)
  - term: 側 (gawa)
    meaning: side or flank
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: When combined with cardinal directions (e.g., **北側**), **側** indicates a specific side of
      an object or area, which is more localized than the general cardinal direction itself.
    grammar_point: 側 (side or flank)
post_false_friends_writeup: When discussing directions, it's easy to mix up words that seem similar but
  have different nuances. For instance, while **方面** indicates a general 'area' or 'towards' a certain
  destination, the cardinal directions like **東** (east) are precise points on a compass. Similarly, **方角**
  is a more formal term for 'direction' or 'bearing,' often used when discussing precise orientations,
  while **東** is used for simple, direct directional indications. Remember that **通り** refers to a 'street,'
  not a direction. And while **入口** and **出口** are general terms for 'entrance' and 'exit,' adding a cardinal
  direction like **東口** (east exit) specifies a particular one. Moreover, terms like **西方**, **東方**, and
  **北方** denote broader geographical regions or general directions, whereas the simple cardinal directions
  specify exact compass points. Lastly, be aware that **玄関** refers to the entire entrance hall, distinct
  from **玄関口**, which is the precise opening of the front door, and **側** indicates a specific side of
  an object or area.

          looking for a specific entrance/exit.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 駅 の {出口} は あそこ です。
        english: The station's exit is over there.

        english: The station's east street is over there.
        hint: 通り (tōri) means 'street,' not an exit. We're looking for a specific exit.
    scene: You're at a large train station, asking for directions to meet a friend who said to meet at
      a specific exit.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: The use of **{東口}** (higashiguchi) specifically points to the 'east exit,' a common way to
      specify meeting points at large stations. 「あそこ」is a neutral way to point to a distant location.
      「そちら」and「向こう」are also common ways to point to a general direction or location.
    etymology: The '口' in **東口** (higashiguchi) literally means 'mouth,' evolving to mean 'entrance' or
      'exit' because it's the 'mouth' of the passage.

          We're looking for a specific compass direction.
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{方角} へ 行き ましょう。'
        english: Let's go in that bearing.
        hint: 方角 (hōgaku) is a more formal term for 'bearing' or 'direction' (often used in technical
          contexts), not a simple instruction to move in a cardinal direction. We're looking for a simple
          instruction.

          move north.
    scene: You and a friend are hiking and need to choose a direction.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: Using **{北} へ** (kita e) or **{北} に** (kita ni) clearly indicates movement in the 'north'
      direction. The volitional **行きましょう** (ikimashō) expresses a suggestion to go, while **行こう** (ikou)
      is its more casual equivalent.
    etymology: The particle **へ** (e) indicates direction or destination of movement, while **に** (ni)
      can also indicate direction, but is often used for a more specific point.

          the general location relative to the park.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の 家 は 公園 の {西方} に あり ます。
        english: My house is in the western direction of the park.
        hint: 西方 (seihō) is 'western direction,' but {西側} (nishigawa) specifically means 'west side,'
          which is more natural for describing the side of a place. We're looking for 'west side.'
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の 家 は 公園 の 西 {方面} に あり ます。
        english: My house is in the park's west area.

        english: My house is in the park's west bearing.
        hint: 方角 (hōgaku) is a formal term for 'bearing' or 'direction,' less natural for describing a
          house's specific location relative to a park's side. We're looking for 'west side.'
    scene: You're telling a new acquaintance where you live in relation to a local landmark.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase **{西側}** (nishigawa - west side) is a common and natural way to specify the location
      relative to another object. The inclusion of **私** (watashi) or **うち** (uchi) for 'my house' is
      standard for both male and female speakers. The particle **に** (ni) marks the location where something
      exists. The polite ending **あります** (arimasu) is typical for this kind of informative statement.
      Using **だ よ** (da yo) makes it more casual, potentially for a younger speaker or closer relationship.
    etymology: The suffix **側** (gawa) means 'side' or 'area,' and when combined with cardinal directions,
      it indicates a specific side of an object or area.

      - competing_japanese:
          - この 道 は {南} {方角} です。
        english: This road is the south direction.
        hint: 方角 (hōgaku) is a formal term for 'bearing' or 'direction,' less natural for describing where
          a road physically leads. We're looking for the path of the road.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 道 は {南} {出口} です。
        english: This road is the south exit.
        hint: 出口 (deguchi) means 'exit,' which does not fit the context of a road leading in a general
          direction. We're describing the road's path.
    scene: A tour guide is explaining the route to a group of tourists.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The use of **{南} へ** (minami e) emphasizes the direction of movement. The use of **行きます**
      (ikimasu) is standard polite form. **伸びて います** (nobite imasu) means 'extends' or 'stretches,' providing
      a more descriptive nuance about the road's path. **繋がっ て い ます** (tsunagaru) means 'to be connected,'
      implying the road leads to that direction.
    etymology: The verb **行く** (iku) means 'to go,' and when used with **へ** (e), it clearly indicates
      the direction of travel. **伸びる** (nobiru) means 'to extend' or 'stretch,' giving a sense of the
      road's physical path. **繋がる** (tsunagaru) means 'to be connected,' implying the road leads to that
      direction.

        english: The sun rises in the eastern direction.
        hint: 東方 (tōhō) is 'eastern direction,' but {東} (higashi) with から (kara - from) is more natural
          when describing the origin of the sun's rising. We're looking for the origin of the sun's path.
      - competing_japanese:

      - competing_japanese:
          - 太陽 は 東 の {通り} から 昇り ます。
        english: The sun rises from the east street.

          for a cardinal direction.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 太陽 は 東 の {入口} から 昇り ます。
        english: The sun rises from the east entrance.

    scene: A teacher explaining natural phenomena to children.
    register: formal
    setting: informative

    nuance: The particle **から** (kara) here indicates the origin or starting point of the sun's movement.
      **昇ります** (noborimasu) is the polite form of 'to rise.' **出ます** (demasu) is also commonly used for
      the sun 'coming out' or appearing. This is a factual statement suitable for an academic setting.
      A female teacher might use a gentle but precise tone.
    etymology: The particle **から** (kara) literally means 'from' and is used to denote the origin of something,
      whether it's a physical starting point or the source of an action.

        hint: 方角 (hōgaku) is a more formal or technical term for 'direction' or 'bearing,' not commonly
          used for a general area like 'northeast part.' We're looking for a combined cardinal direction.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の オフィス は 市 の 北 {方面} に あり ます。
        english: My office is located in the city's north area.
        hint: 方面 (hōmen) refers to a general area or direction towards a place, not a specific combined
          cardinal direction like northeast. We're looking for a precise composite direction.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の オフィス は 市 の {北側} に あり ます。
        english: My office is located on the north side of the city.
        hint: 北側 (kitagawa) refers only to the 'north side,' not the 'northeast.' We're looking for the
          specific combined direction.
    scene: You're describing the location of your workplace to a new colleague.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: The combination of cardinal directions like **{北東}** (hokutō) for 'northeast' is formed by
      simply combining the two direction kanji. The particle **に** (ni) indicates the location of existence,
      similar to 'in' or 'at'. Using **位置 し て い ます** (ichi shite imasu) provides a slightly more formal
      nuance than **あります** (arimasu) for 'is located'.
    etymology: Combined directions like **北東** (hokutō - northeast) are created by juxtaposing the kanji
      for the primary cardinal directions, showing how Japanese efficiently forms compound words for precise
      spatial descriptions.

          bus stop. We're looking for the entrance/exit.
      - competing_japanese:
          - バス 停 の {出口} は デパート の すぐ 外 です。
        english: The bus stop exit is just outside the department store.
        hint: While バス停口 functions as an exit, simply using 出口 (deguchi) is too general and doesn't convey
          the specific compound term for a bus stop's entrance/exit. We're looking for the commonly used
          specific term for a bus stop entrance/exit.
    scene: You're explaining to a tourist where to find the bus stop.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: The term **バス 停 {口}** (basutei-guchi) specifically refers to the entrance/exit point of a
      bus stop, often indicating the designated boarding or alighting area. This is a common compound
      noun. Using 「すぐ 外」 (sugu soto) means 'just outside,' indicating close proximity. The particle **の**
      (no) connects 'department store' to 'outside'.
    etymology: Similar to 東口, the **口** (kuchi/guchi) in **バス停口** (basutei-guchi) functions as a suffix
      denoting an entrance or exit specific to the preceding noun, in this case, a 'bus stop' (バス停 - basutei).

        english: Please wait at the entrance hall.
        hint: While 玄関 (genkan) refers to the entrance hall, {玄関口} (genkan-guchi) more explicitly refers
          to the exact 'mouth' or 'opening' of the entrance, emphasizing the physical doorway. We're looking
          for the specific point of entry.
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{入口} で 待っ て ください。'
        english: Please wait at the entrance.
        hint: 入口 (iriguchi) is a general term for 'entrance,' but it doesn't carry the specific nuance
          of a residential or formal 'front door' like 玄関口. We're looking for the specific term for a
          front door.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 玄関 {方面} で 待っ て ください。
        english: Please wait in the front door area.
        hint: 方面 (hōmen) indicates a general area, which is too vague when specifying a precise waiting
          spot like a front door. We're looking for the specific location.
    scene: You're instructing a delivery person where to leave a package.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The term **{玄関口}** (genkan-guchi) specifies the actual 'opening' or 'threshold' of the front
      door, making it more precise than just 玄関 (genkan - entrance hall). The particle **で** (de) indicates
      the location of the action. The use of 「お 待ち ください」 (omachikudasai) is a very polite and formal way
      to say 'please proceed,' typical for an older female speaker in a formal interaction.
    etymology: The term **玄関** (genkan) refers to the traditional Japanese entranceway, typically with
      a step down. Adding **口** (kuchi/guchi) emphasizes the 'opening' or 'mouth' of this specific entrance,
      making **玄関口** the precise point of entry.
  - english: There's a beautiful mountain to the north of the town.
    japanese:
      - 町 の {北} に 美しい 山 が あり ます。
      - 町 の {北側} に 美しい 山 が あり ます。
      - 町 の {北方} に 美しい 山 が あり ます。
    english_literally: Town's north beautiful mountain exists.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 町 の 北 の {方面} に 美しい 山 が あり ます。
        english: There's a beautiful mountain in the north area of the town.
        hint: 方面 (hōmen) implies a broader, more general 'area' or 'direction towards,' which is less
          precise than directly stating 'to the north.' We're looking for the specific cardinal direction
          relative to the town.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 町 の 北 の {方角} に 美しい 山 が あり ます。
        english: There's a beautiful mountain in the north bearing of the town.
        hint: 方角 (hōgaku) is a more formal or technical term for 'bearing' or 'orientation,' often used
          in navigation. For general description of location, {北} (kita) or {北側} (kitagawa) is more natural.
          We're looking for a natural, descriptive term.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 町 の 北 {通り} に 美しい 山 が あり ます。
        english: There's a beautiful mountain on the north street of the town.
        hint: 通り (tōri) means 'street,' which is illogical for describing the location of a mountain.
          We're looking for a cardinal direction.
    scene: You're describing the local geography to a visitor.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: Using **{北} に** (kita ni) directly states the mountain's location relative to the town. **北側**
      (kitagawa - north side) is also very natural and common. **北方** (hoppō - northern direction/region)
      is a more formal or geographical term. The particle **に** (ni) marks the location where something
      exists. This is a straightforward factual statement.
    etymology: The particle **に** (ni) is commonly used to indicate the location of existence for inanimate
      objects (or even animate ones when using いる/ある constructions), signifying 'at' or 'in' a certain
      place. It marks the static position.
  - english: Turn west at the next intersection.
    japanese:
      - 次 の 交差 点 で {西} へ 曲がっ て ください。
      - 次 の 交差 点 で {西} に 曲がっ て ください。
      - 次 の 交差 点 を {西} に 曲がっ て ください。
    english_literally: Next intersection at west towards turn please.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 次 の 交差 点 で {西方} に 曲がっ て ください。
        english: Turn in the western direction at the next intersection.
        hint: 西方 (seihō) emphasizes the general western direction, but {西} (nishi) alone with the particle
          is more natural. We're looking for a simple instruction.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 次 の 交差 点 で 西 {方面} に 曲がっ て ください。
        english: Turn towards the west area at the next intersection.
        hint: 方面 (hōmen) indicates a general area or 'towards' a place, which is too vague when specifying
          a precise turning direction. We're looking for a specific cardinal direction.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 次 の 交差 点 で 西 の {通り} に 曲がっ て ください。
        english: Turn to the west street at the next intersection.
        hint: 通り (tōri) means 'street,' implying a turn onto a specific road named 'West Street,' not
          a turn in the west cardinal direction. We're looking for a cardinal direction.
    scene: You're giving driving directions to a friend.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The particle **へ** (e) or **に** (ni) clearly indicates the direction of the turn. **曲がっ て
      ください** (magatte kudasai) is the polite imperative for 'please turn.' This is a common and direct
      way to give navigational instructions. A male speaker might use this direct and concise instructional
      tone.
    etymology: The verb **曲がる** (magaru) means 'to turn' or 'to bend.' When combined with a direction
      and a particle like **へ** (e) or **に** (ni), it forms a fundamental instruction for navigation,
      signifying movement towards that specific cardinal point.
  - english: The weather forecast said it will rain in the Kanto region, especially in the western part.
    japanese:
      - 天気 予報 に よる と、関東 地方 は 雨 で、特に {西} の 方 が 降る そう です。
      - 天気 予報 で は、関東 地方 で 雨 が 降る と の こと です が、特に {西} の 地域 で 降る よう です。
    english_literally: Weather forecast according to, Kanto region rain is, especially west direction
      will fall it seems.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 天気 予報 に よる と、関東 地方 は 雨 で、特に {西方} が 降る そう です。
        english: The weather forecast said it will rain in the Kanto region, especially in the western
          direction.
        hint: 西方 (seihō) emphasizes the general western direction, but {西} の 方 (nishi no hō) specifically
          means 'the western side/part,' which is more natural when referring to a region within a larger
          area. We're looking for 'the western part'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 天気 予報 に よる と、関東 地方 は 雨 で、特に 西 {方面} が 降る そう です。
        english: The weather forecast said it will rain in the Kanto region, especially in the west area.
        hint: 方面 (hōmen) denotes a general 'area' or 'direction towards,' which is less precise than specifying
          'the western part' for weather. We're looking for a specific part of a region.
    scene: Two colleagues are discussing the weather forecast for the upcoming weekend.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: Using **{西} の 方** (nishi no hō) or **{西} の 地域** (nishi no chiiki) specifies 'the western part'
      or 'western region,' a common way to refer to a subsection of a larger area, often used in weather
      forecasts or geographical descriptions. This phrasing indicates precision. 「に よると」 (ni yoru to)
      means 'according to,' indicating the source of information.
    etymology: The phrase **～の方** (no hō) literally means 'towards/in the direction of' but is commonly
      used to indicate a general area or 'part of' something. When combined with a cardinal direction,
      it refers to that specific part or region within a larger geographical entity.
  - english: The main entrance is on the north side of the building.
    japanese:
      - 正門 は 建物 の {北側} に あり ます。
      - 正門 は 建物 の {北} に 位置 し て い ます。
      - 正門 は 建物 の {北口} です。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 正門 は 建物 の 北 の {方面} に あり ます。
        english: The main entrance is in the building's north area.
        hint: 方面 (hōmen) indicates a general area, not a specific side or entrance of a building. We're
          looking for the specific location of the main entrance.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 正門 は 建物 の {北方} に あり ます。
        english: The main entrance is in the building's northern direction.
        hint: 北方 (hoppō) is a more general or technical term for 'northern direction,' whereas {北側} (kitagawa)
          or {北口} (kitaguchi) are more appropriate for specifying an entrance on a particular side of
          a building. We're looking for a specific side or entrance.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 正門 は 建物 の 北 {通り} に あり ます。
        english: The main entrance is on the building's north street.
        hint: 通り (tōri) means 'street,' referring to a physical road, not the location of an entrance
          on a building's side. We're looking for an entrance on a specific side.
    scene: You are explaining the layout of a school campus to a new student.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: Using **{北側}** (kitagawa) is a common way to specify a side of a building. If it's a specific
      gate, **{北口}** (kitaguchi) can be used, meaning 'north gate/entrance'. The particle **に** (ni) marks
      the location. The term **正門** (seimon) refers specifically to a 'main gate' or 'main entrance,'
      often used for schools, temples, or large estates.
    etymology: The suffix **側** (gawa) means 'side,' and when appended to a cardinal direction (e.g.,
      北 - kita), it forms compound nouns like **北側** (kitagawa), meaning 'north side.' This construction
      is widely used to specify the orientation of objects or parts of structures.
  - english: I'll meet you at the west exit of Shibuya Station.
    japanese:
      - 渋谷 駅 の {西口} で 待ち合わせ し ましょう。
      - 渋谷 駅 の {西口} で 会い ましょう。
      - 渋谷 駅 の {西口} で 待っ て いる よ。
    english_literally: Shibuya Station's west exit at meet let's.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 渋谷 駅 の 西 の {方面} で 待ち合わせ し ましょう。
        english: Let's meet in the west area of Shibuya Station.
        hint: 方面 (hōmen) indicates a general area, which is too vague for specifying a precise meeting
          point like a station exit. We're looking for a specific exit.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 渋谷 駅 の 西 の {方角} で 待ち合わせ し ましょう。
        english: Let's meet in the west bearing of Shibuya Station.
        hint: 方角 (hōgaku) is a formal term for 'bearing' or 'direction,' not appropriate for naming a
          specific station exit. We're looking for the specific station exit.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 渋谷 駅 の 西 {通り} で 待ち合わせ し ましょう。
        english: Let's meet on the west street of Shibuya Station.
        hint: 通り (tōri) means 'street,' not a specific station exit. We're looking for a specific exit.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 渋谷 駅 の {出口} で 待ち合わせ し ましょう。
        english: Let's meet at Shibuya Station's exit.
        hint: 出口 (deguchi) is a general term. 「南口」 (minamiguchi) specifies *which* exit/gate. We're looking
          for the specific 'west exit'.
    scene: You are making plans with a friend to meet at a busy train station.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: Specifying the **{西口}** (nishiguchi - west exit) is crucial for meeting at large, complex
      stations like Shibuya, as they often have multiple exits in various directions. **待ち合わせ し ましょう**
      (machiawase shimashō) is a polite volitional phrase for 'let's meet.' The more casual **待っ て いる
      よ** (matte iru yo) means 'I'll be waiting.'
    etymology: The concept of numbered or directional exits (e.g., **西口** - nishiguchi) is integral to
      navigating Japan's extensive and often multi-layered train stations, which are designed for efficient
      movement of large crowds. The clarity of specific meeting points is paramount.
  - english: Please head towards the south gate.
    japanese:
      - '{南口} へ お 進み ください。'
      - '{南口} の 方 へ お 進み ください。'
      - '{南口} へ 向かっ て ください。'
    english_literally: South exit towards please proceed.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 南 {方面} へ お 進み ください。
        english: Please head towards the south area.
        hint: 方面 (hōmen) is too general. We're looking for a specific gate or entrance/exit. While 南口
          is an 'exit', it functions as a 'gate' for general entry/exit.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 南 {方角} へ お 進み ください。
        english: Please head towards the south bearing.
        hint: 方角 (hōgaku) is too formal and technical for giving simple navigational instructions for
          a gate. We're looking for a specific gate.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 南 の {通り} へ お 進み ください。
        english: Please head towards the south street.
        hint: 通り (tōri) refers to a street, not a specific gate or entrance. We're looking for a specific
          gate.
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{出口} へ お 進み ください。'
        english: Please head towards the exit.
        hint: 出口 (deguchi) is a general term. 「南口」 (minamiguchi) specifies *which* exit/gate. We're looking
          for a specific, cardinal-direction gate.
    scene: An announcement at a large event venue guiding attendees.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The use of **{南口}** (minamiguchi) indicates a specific 'south gate' or 'south exit' for a
      facility. 「お 進み ください」 (osusumi kudasai) is a very polite and formal way to say 'please proceed,'
      commonly used in public announcements or formal instructions. The particle **へ** (e) indicates the
      direction of movement.
    etymology: The suffix **口** (kuchi/guchi) can also be used to denote a 'gate' or 'entrance' point,
      especially in public facilities or parks, not just train stations. In this context, **南口** refers
      to the main or designated southern access point.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, mastering the cardinal directions and the use
  of **～口** is key to navigating Japanese spaces and communicating effectively about locations. Pay close
  attention to the particles used, such as **へ** (e) or **に** (ni) for movement, and **から** (kara) for
  origin, as they specify the exact relationship between the direction and the action or object. Furthermore,
  notice how the cardinal directions can combine (e.g., 北東) or take suffixes like **～側** (gawa) or **～方**
  (hō) to specify areas or sides, providing rich detail for spatial descriptions.
