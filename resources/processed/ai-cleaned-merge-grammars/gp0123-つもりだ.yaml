    "etymology": "The word 「つもり」 comes from the verb 「積もる」 (つもる), which means \"to pile up\" or \"to accumulate.\" This implies that one has \"piled up\" enough resolve, conviction, or a strong belief to act in a certain way or hold a particular assumption. It conveys a sense of strong internal commitment or perception. In some contexts, it can humorously or critically suggest that someone has \"piled up\" enough nerve or self-delusion to act in a particular manner, even if that manner is misguided.",
    "writeup": "「つもりだ」 is a versatile grammatical expression in Japanese that conveys either **intention** or **conviction/belief**. Its precise nuance depends heavily on the part of speech it modifies and the context of the sentence.\n\n**1. Expressing Intention:**\nWhen 「つもりだ」 follows a verb in its dictionary form (e.g., 「行くつもりだ」) or its negative 「ない」 form (e.g., 「行かないつもりだ」), it signifies the speaker's firm intention or plan to do (or not to do) something. It represents a stronger, more personal statement of intent than simply stating a future action (e.g., 「行きます」).\n\n*   **Verb (dictionary form) + つもりだ**: Indicates a positive, definite intention.  \n    例: 「明日、図書館で勉強する**つもり**だ。」 (I intend to study at the library tomorrow.)\n*   **Verb (ない form) + つもりだ**: Indicates a negative intention, meaning the speaker has actively decided not to do something. \n    例: 「今日はもうパンは食べない**つもり**だ。」 (I don't intend to eat any more bread today.)\n\n**Important Nuance: 「ないつもり」 vs. 「つもりはない」**\nWhile both express a negative intention, there is a subtle but important difference:\n*   **「Verbない + つもりだ」**: Implies an active decision *not* to do something. The action is being intentionally avoided or abstained from.\n*   **「Verb + つもりはない」**: Indicates a general lack of intention or no plans to do something, without necessarily implying active avoidance. It can suggest disinterest or simply that the thought hasn't occurred.\n\n**2. Expressing Conviction or Belief:**\nWhen 「つもりだ」 follows a noun, an い-adjective, or a な-adjective, it expresses the speaker's firm conviction or belief about a state, identity, or quality. This usage often implies that the conviction might be mistaken, or that the speaker is acting *as if* something is true, regardless of objective reality. It can sometimes carry a sarcastic, critical, or even humorous tone, questioning the validity of the belief.\n\n*   **Noun + の + つもりだ**: Expresses the belief that one *is* that thing, or that something is meant to be a certain way. This construction can sometimes imply a mismatch between reality and the speaker's (or another's) self-perception.\n    例: 「あなたはまだ学生の**つもり**ですか？」 (Do you still think you're a student?)\n*   **い-adjective (plain non-past) + つもりだ**: Expresses a conviction about a quality or characteristic.\n    例: 「彼は自分が強い**つもり**だ。」 (He believes he is strong.)\n*   **な-adjective (stem) + な + つもりだ**: Similar to い-adjectives, it expresses a conviction about a quality.\n    例: 「彼女はいつも自分がきれいな**つもり**でいる。」 (She always thinks she is beautiful.)\n\nThis aspect of 「つもりだ」 relates to its etymology, where one has \"piled up\" enough confidence or self-perception to act as if something is true. This can lead to observations where the speaker's perception differs from objective reality.",
