    "etymology": "The word つもり comes from the verb 積もる (つもる), which means \"to pile up\" or \"to accumulate.\" This implies that one has \"piled up\" enough resolve, conviction, or a strong belief to act in a certain way or hold a particular assumption. It conveys a sense of strong internal commitment or perception.",
    "writeup": "「つもりだ」 is a versatile grammar point in Japanese that conveys either **intention** or **conviction/belief**. Its usage depends on the part of speech it follows.\n\n**1. Expressing Intention:**\nWhen 「つもりだ」 follows a verb in its dictionary form (e.g., 行くつもりだ) or negative ない form (e.g., 行かないつもりだ), it signifies the speaker's firm intention or plan to do (or not to do) something. It's a stronger statement of intent than simply stating a future action (e.g., 行きます).\n\n*   **Verb (dictionary form) + つもりだ**: Indicates a positive intention.\n    *   例: 「明日、図書館で勉強する**つもり**だ。」 (I intend to study at the library tomorrow.)\n*   **Verb (ない form) + つもりだ**: Indicates a negative intention, meaning one actively decides not to do something.\n    *   例: 「今日はもうパンは食べない**つもり**だ。」 (I don't intend to eat any more bread today.)\n\n**Important Nuance: 「ないつもり」 vs. 「つもりはない」**\nWhile both express a negative intention, there's a subtle difference:\n*   **「ないつもり」**: Implies an active decision *not* to do something. The action is being intentionally avoided or abstained from.\n*   **「つもりはない」**: Indicates a general lack of intention or no plans to do something, without necessarily implying active avoidance. It can suggest disinterest or simply that the thought hasn't occurred.\n\n**2. Expressing Conviction or Belief:**\nWhen 「つもりだ」 follows a noun, an い-adjective, or a な-adjective, it expresses the speaker's firm conviction or belief about a state or quality. This usage often implies that the conviction might be mistaken or that the speaker is acting *as if* something is true, regardless of reality.\n\n*   **Noun + の + つもりだ**: Expresses the belief that one *is* that thing, or that something is meant to be a certain way. This can sometimes carry a sarcastic or critical tone, questioning the validity of the belief.\n    *   例: 「あなたはまだ学生の**つもり**ですか？」 (Do you still think you're a student?)\n*   **い-adjective + つもりだ**: Expresses conviction about a quality.\n    *   例: 「彼は自分が強い**つもり**だ。」 (He believes he is strong.)\n*   **な-adjective (stem) + な + つもりだ**: Expresses conviction about a quality.\n    *   例: 「彼女はいつも自分がきれいな**つもり**でいる。」 (She always thinks she is beautiful.)\n\nThis conviction aspect of 「つもりだ」 relates to its etymology: one has \"piled up\" enough confidence or self-perception to act as if something is true. This can sometimes lead to humorous or critical observations when the speaker's perception differs from reality.",
