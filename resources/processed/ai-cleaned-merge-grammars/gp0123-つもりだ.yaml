    "etymology": "The word つもり comes from the verb 積もる (つもる), which means \"to pile up\" or \"to accumulate\". The nuance is that you have 'piled up' the resolve or conviction to do something, or that you have a strong belief or assumption about something.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point つもりだ expresses intention or conviction. It translates to \"intend to,\" \"plan to,\" or \"believe that\".\n\n*   When used with a verb in dictionary form (dictionary form + つもりだ), it expresses the **intention** to do something. For example, 日本に行くつもりだ means \"I intend to go to Japan.\"\n*   When used with a verb in *nai* form (ない form + つもりだ), it expresses the **intention not** to do something. For example, 今日は何も買わないつもりだ means \"I don't intend to buy anything today.\"\n    *   A critical nuance exists between the structure *nai tsumori* (ないつもり) and *tsumori wa nai* (つもりはない). *Nai tsumori* implies an active decision *not* to do something, meaning the action is being intentionally avoided. Conversely, *tsumori wa nai* indicates a general lack of intention or no plans to do something, without necessarily implying active avoidance.\n*   When used with a noun (noun + のつもりだ), it expresses the **belief** that one *is* that thing, or that something is meant to be a certain way. For example, 先生のつもりだ means \"I'm convinced that I'm the teacher.\" This structure can also convey a sarcastic tone, as in \"Are you really acting like that's an apology?\" (あなたは謝ってるつもり？). This specific usage often conveys a sense of feigned action or a misperception, linking to the etymology of *tsumoru* (積もる, to pile up) where one \"piles up\" the resolve or conviction to act a certain way.\n*   When used with an adjective, it expresses the belief about the quality of something. For example, 元気なつもりだ means \"I'm convinced that I'm healthy.\"\n\nRegarding the negative form *tsumori wa nai*, the particle は can be interchanged with が or じゃ (though では is less common in this specific construction). The difference in nuance is subtle: using が gives the impression of being 'uninterested' in the action, while じゃ (or ではない) simply states that the action is not the intended result.",
