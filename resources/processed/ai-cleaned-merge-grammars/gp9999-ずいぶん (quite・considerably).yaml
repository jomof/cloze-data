etymology: The word 随分 (ずいぶん) originally had a meaning related to "as one pleases," "arbitrarily," or
  "recklessly." It was written with kanji meaning 随 (to follow, obey) and 分 (portion, share). Over time,
  its usage shifted from indicating arbitrary action to signifying a large or considerable degree, often
  implying something beyond expectation. The nuance of "considerably" or "quite" today often carries a
  subtle undertone of the speaker's subjective assessment or surprise at the degree.
writeup: |-
  ずいぶん is an adverb in Japanese that signifies a considerable, great, or surprising degree of something. It is often translated as "quite," "considerably," "very much," or "extremely." Unlike other intensifiers like とても (totemo) or すごく (sugoku), ずいぶん often carries a nuance of subjective surprise or an unexpected level. It suggests that the speaker finds the degree or amount to be more than what was anticipated.

  This adverb can modify verbs, adjectives (both い-adjectives and な-adjectives), adverbs, and even nouns. When modifying verbs, it usually precedes them. When modifying adjectives or other adverbs, it also comes before them. While it's generally neutral in terms of politeness, its use can sometimes sound slightly informal, depending on the overall context and sentence structure. For very formal or objective statements, other intensifiers might be preferred.

  ずいぶん implies a comparison, often unspoken, to a previous state or expectation. For example, if you say 「ずいぶん 早く 着きましたね」 (You arrived quite early, didn't you?), it implies that the arrival was earlier than you expected. It's a useful word for expressing subjective impressions about degree or quantity.

post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  While とても, かなり, 大変, and 結構 can all be translated as "quite" or "very," they carry distinct nuances. ずいぶん emphasizes a degree that is surprisingly high or more than expected by the speaker. For instance, if you say 「この本は{ずいぶん}面白かった」 (This book was surprisingly interesting), it means it was more interesting than you anticipated.
  とても functions as a more neutral intensifier, simply stating a high degree without surprise, as in 「この本はとても面白かった」 (This Book was very interesting).
  かなり suggests a significant, good amount, but less likely to imply surprise compared to ずいぶん. 「かなり」 also means "quite" but is slightly more objective.
  大変 can be used as an intensifier like "very," but often retains a sense of magnitude or difficulty, as in 「大変な仕事」 (a difficult/tough job). When it intensifies, it suggests a significant, sometimes overwhelming, degree.
  結構 implies "quite" often with a nuance of satisfaction or "better than expected," and can also politely decline something. Each adverb has its own flavor, and choosing the right one depends on the subtle feeling you wish to convey.
