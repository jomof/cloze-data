jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Indicates that someone is unable to do something even if they want to. It expresses a
    situation where one's desire to do something is thwarted by external circumstances or internal limitations.
    While often used in more formal contexts, its conjugation flexibility allows for use in various registers.
  function: Expresses the impossibility of an action despite the intention or desire to perform it.
  nuance: Conveys a sense of frustration, helplessness, or an insurmountable obstacle preventing the desired
    action.
etymology: 「よう」 is the volitional form of a verb, indicating intention or desire. 「にも」 adds the nuance
  of "even though" or "despite." 「ない」 negates the possibility of the action. Together, they create the
  meaning of "even though I want to, I cannot."
writeup: The grammar point 「ようにも(〜ない)」 expresses that even if someone wants to do something, they are
  unable to because of external circumstances or internal limitations. It combines a verb in the volitional
  form (expressing intent) with 「にも」 (even though) and a negative ending 「ない」 (cannot). The nuance is
  one of frustration or helplessness, where the desire to act is present but unrealizable. It's similar
  to saying "I wish I could, but I can't" or "Even if I wanted to, I couldn't." This expression highlights
  a gap between one's will or intention and the reality of their ability to act. It's often used when
  expressing a personal dilemma or an external barrier. While the general tone can lean formal, particularly
  with polite conjugations like 「〜ません」, its core structure is versatile enough to appear in casual conversations
  as well, especially when paired with plain forms of negation.

  - term: つもり
    meaning: intention, plan
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「ようにも〜ない」, 「つもり」 indicates intention but doesn't necessarily imply inability. It states
      what one plans to do, not what one is prevented from doing.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]つもりだ (to intend to)'
  - term: たい
    meaning: want to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たい」 expresses desire, but it doesn't convey the obstacle or inability present in 「ようにも〜ない」.
      It simply states a wish without implying any barrier.
    grammar_point: たい (want to do)
  - term: ～ようとする
    meaning: to try to; to be about to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ようにも〜ない」 emphasizes an intention or desire that is ultimately thwarted by an external
      obstacle, 「ようとする」 simply states an attempt or being on the verge of doing something, without inherently
      implying the impossibility or inability of the action.
    grammar_point: Verb[volitional]+とする (try about to)
  - term: ～ても
    meaning: even if; even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜ても」 can express a hypothetical condition, but it doesn't inherently include the speaker's
      unfulfilled desire to perform the action. 「ようにも〜ない」 specifically highlights the desire that cannot
      be realized due to external circumstances.
    grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「つもり」 simply states an intention, 「ようにも〜ない」 indicates an attempt or
  desire to do something that is ultimately impossible due to circumstances. Similarly, 「たい」 conveys a
  wish, whereas 「ようにも〜ない」 adds a layer of frustration by highlighting the inability to fulfill that wish.
  「～ようとする」 focuses purely on the act of trying, without necessarily including the outcome of inability.
  Finally, 「〜ても」 states a conditional 'even if', but lacks the specific nuance of a deeply felt personal
  desire that is thwarted, which is central to 「ようにも〜ない」. The key distinction for 「ようにも〜ない」 is the presence
  of an insurmountable barrier that prevents the desired action, making the internal desire irrelevant
  in the face of external reality.
