    "writeup": "「にあたり」 or 「にあたって」 is a formal grammar pattern used to convey \"at the time of (A),\" \"when doing (A),\" or \"on the occasion of (A).\" Similar to 「に際して」 (\"on the occasion of (A)\"), it's often used when preparing for future events. The structure combines 「に」 with the verb 「当たる」 (to hit, to come into contact) in either its formal-conjunctive form (にあたり) or te-form (にあたって). It's commonly used in formal writing and speeches.\n\nThere are two primary nuances:\n\n*   **(A) is a special occasion or condition** from which (B) arises.\n*   **(A) is a goal or target** and (B) is the means or measures taken in response.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Unlike 「に際して」, which can be used in both positive and negative situations, 「にあたり」 is primarily used for positive or neutral situations.",
