    "etymology": "The word 「全く (mattaku)」 comes from the kanji 「全 (zen)」, meaning \"whole\" or \"complete\". Thus, 「全く〜ない」 literally means \"completely not\" or \"entirely not\" something.",
    "writeup": "全く〜ない is an expression that combines the adverb 全く with a word in its negative ない form. It is often translated as \"not at all (A)\". Literally, it is closer to \"completely not (A)\" or \"entirely not (A)\", coming from the kanji 全's meaning of \"whole\". Like many other adverbs, 全く may be used at the beginning of a sentence or directly before the word it describes as being \"not at all (A)\". It is common to see this expression in both kanji and hiragana forms, so learn both early.\n\n全く is similar to 全然, another grammar point highlighting a complete lack of something. However, 全く tends to sound more serious, making it more suitable for formal writing/situations. 全然, on the other hand, is more common in casual speech.",
