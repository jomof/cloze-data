    "etymology": "「べき」 comes from the classical auxiliary verb 「べし」, which indicates necessity or obligation. 「べし」 itself is derived from the kanji 「可」, meaning 'permissible' or 'possible', implying that the action is the most reasonable or only acceptable choice. Thus, 「べき」 carries a strong nuance of obligation.",
    "writeup": "The auxiliary verb 「べき」 expresses a strong sense of obligation, recommendation, or what **should** be done. It is attached to the dictionary form of a verb (except for 「する」, which can become 「するべき」 or 「すべき」) and followed by 「だ」. It conveys that something 'ought to be done' or 'must be done' because it's the right or reasonable thing to do.\n\n「べき」 implies a moral or logical imperative, suggesting that other courses of action are less desirable or unacceptable. It is a highly versatile expression used across all registers and age groups, without specific gendered usage.\n\nTo express something that **should have** been done, use 「べきだった」.\n\n「べきではない」 expresses that something **should not** be done.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   The nuance of 「べき」 is stronger than 「ほうがいい」 but weaker than 「なければならない」.",
