    "etymology": "The term 「べき」 comes from the classical Japanese auxiliary verb 「べし」, which indicates necessity, obligation, or suitability. The kanji 「可き」, meaning 'permissible,' underlies its nuance of something being the only acceptable choice.",
    "writeup": "The auxiliary verb 「べき」, being the attributive form of 「べし」, is paired with verbs to express that something \"ought to be done.\" It implies a moral obligation or that a certain action is the only reasonable course. The kanji 「可き」, meaning something 'permissible', indicates that any other action would not be acceptable, making it a strong expression. 「べき」 is paired with the plain (non-past) form of a verb, followed by 「だ」 or another noun.\n\nIt can be translated as \"must do (A)\" or \"should do (A),\" but it always carries the nuance of being the only 'permissible' choice.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nThe verb appearing with 「べき」 cannot be in the past tense. Use 「だった」 or 「でした」 after 「べき」 to express something that 'ought to have been done' in the past.\n\n**Fun Facts**\n\nIn modern Japanese, there are only 18 auxiliary verbs; 「べき」 is not among them. 「べし」 (the standard form) is considered a classical auxiliary verb. Therefore, 「べき」 (and 「べし」) are often referred to as classical auxiliary verbs.\n\nThe combination of 「する」 and 「べき」 is a rare grammatical exception where two forms are considered equally correct. Thus, either 「するべき」 or 「すべき」 may be used.",
