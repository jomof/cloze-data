        "function": "marks a limit, extent, or endpoint in time, space, or the scope of an action or state."
    },
    "etymology": "まで originally comes from the verb 「待つ」 (matsu, to wait). The connection is that you \"wait until\" a certain point in time or reach a certain location. Over time, it evolved into the particle まで that we use today, signifying a boundary or endpoint.",
    "writeup": "The particle まで is used to indicate a limit or endpoint in various contexts, including time, location, or the extent of an action. It roughly translates to \"until,\" \"till,\" or \"to (but no further than)\" in English.\n\nWhen referring to a point in time, まで specifies the termination of an action or state. For example, 「明日まで」 means \"until tomorrow,\" indicating that something continues up to and including tomorrow.\n\nWhen used with locations, まで signifies a destination or a physical boundary that an action reaches but does not cross. For instance, 「駅まで」 means \"to the station,\" implying movement that ends at the station.\n\nまで can also be used to describe actions that continued up to a certain point in the past, often translated as \"up until.\" This emphasizes the duration leading to that past event.\n\nIt is important to distinguish まで from に when indicating a destination. While に often marks the point of arrival, まで specifically emphasizes reaching *up to* that point as a boundary or limit. に can sometimes imply entry *into* a place, whereas まで focuses on the external boundary.",
