    "etymology": "まで originally comes from the verb 「待つ」 (matsu, to wait). The connection is that you \"wait until\" a certain point in time or reach a certain location. Over time, it evolved into the particle まで that we use today.",
    "writeup": "The particle まで roughly translates to \"as far as.\" When used with nouns indicating endpoints, such as times or days, it signifies \"until,\" \"till,\" or \"to.\" When indicating location, まで indicates movement \"to\" a place, but not beyond it. It can also describe past time, where \"up until\" is more natural in English. まで is similar to に, but implies an upper limit.",
