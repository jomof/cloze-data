    "etymology": "The particle まで is derived from Old Japanese, where it functioned to mark a boundary or endpoint. Its usage has consistently evolved to denote a limit in terms of time, space, or extent, signifying 'up to' or 'until' a certain point. It embodies the concept of reaching a boundary without necessarily exceeding it.",
    "writeup": "The particle まで is used to indicate a limit or endpoint in various contexts, including time, location, or the extent of an action. It roughly translates to \"until,\" \"till,\" or \"to (but no further than)\" in English.When referring to a point in time, まで specifies the termination of an action or state. For example, 「明日まで」 means \"until tomorrow,\" indicating that something continues up to and including tomorrow.When used with locations, まで signifies a destination or a physical boundary that an action reaches but does not cross. For instance, 「駅まで」 means \"to the station,\" implying movement that ends at the station.まで can also be used about actions that continued up to a certain point in the past, often translated as \"up until.\" This emphasizes the duration leading to that past event.It is important to distinguish まで from に . While に often marks the point of arrival, まで specifically emphasizes reaching *up to* that point as a boundary or limit. に can sometimes imply entry *into* a place, whereas まで focuses on the external boundary.",

            "nuance": "Unlike Noun+「まで」, which indicates a continuous state or action up to a point, 「までに」 specifies a deadline or a point *before* which an action must be completed. It marks a point in time, not a duration."

            "nuance": "This usage of 「まで」 functions differently, emphasizing an unexpected or surprising extent, often translated as 'even' or 'to the extent of'. It is not about a simple limit in time or space, but rather about intensity or inclusion, and typically does not directly follow a noun indicating a simple endpoint."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When distinguishing between Noun+「まで」 and 「までに」, remember that 「まで」 expresses continuation *up to* a limit (e.g., \"until tomorrow\"), while 「までに」 emphasizes completion *by* a deadline (e.g., \"by tomorrow\"). The other uses of 「まで」, such as \"even\" or \"to the extent of,\" attach to different parts of the sentence and carry a nuance of surprise or emphasis rather than a simple boundary. Furthermore, while 「に」 can mark a destination or time point, it lacks the emphasis on duration or the 'up to' boundary that 「まで」 carries.",
