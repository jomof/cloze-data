    "etymology": "The structure combines the conditional/temporal particle 「たら」 with 「最後」 (saigo), meaning \"end\" or \"last.\" Thus, 「たら最後」 literally means \"if/when... then the end/last result is...\", implying an irreversible consequence.",
    "writeup": "「たら最後」 expresses the idea that once something happens, a negative or undesirable result is inevitable. It is akin to saying \"once (A), then definitely (B)\", where (B) is invariably a negative consequence expected to occur as a direct result of action (A). This structure can be translated as \"once (A), (B)\", \"now that (A), (B)\", or \"as soon as (A), (B)\".\n\nThis grammatical point can also be expressed as 「たが最後」. Both 「たら」 and 「が」 function as conjunctions here. While 「たら」 conveys a conditional or temporal \"if/when,\" 「が」 typically implies \"however\" or \"but.\" Therefore, 「たが最後」 could be interpreted as \"(A) happens, but the inevitable outcome is (B),\" whereas 「たら最後」 suggests \"when (A) occurs, the final result will be (B).\" Despite these subtle etymological distinctions, these two forms are used completely interchangeably in modern Japanese.\n\nThe term 「最後」 (saigo), meaning \"end\" or \"last,\" emphasizes that the subsequent consequence (B) represents the irreversible \"final state.\" Although 「最後」 often appears before the comma in these sentences, it is logically connected to the (B) clause, signifying that the event (A) leads to this ultimate, often unwelcome, conclusion.\n\n**Important Consideration:** Occasionally, the (B) clause may be omitted when the negative outcome is self-evident or strongly implied by context.",
