    "etymology": "The grammar point 「たら最後」 combines 「たら」 (the conditional form of a verb, indicating 'if' or 'when') with 「最後」 (saigo), meaning 'the end' or 'the last'. Etymologically, it suggests that once the condition expressed by the verb in 「たら」 is met, the situation will inevitably lead to the 'end,' usually a negative outcome. 「たが最後」 uses the conjunction 「が」 to mean 「but」. Hence the nuance: '(A), but it will end up as (B)'.",
    "writeup": "「たら最後」 and 「たが最後」 both mean \"once (A), definitely (B).\" (B) is always something negative that is thought to inevitably occur once the action of (A) happens. These expressions may be translated as \"once (A), (B),\" \"now that (A), (B),\" or \"as soon as (A), (B).\"\n\nBoth 「たら」 and 「が」 are being used as conjunction particles. 「たら」 carries its usual meaning of \"if\" or \"when,\" while 「が」 has the meaning of \"however,\" or \"but.\" This means that 「たが最後」 means \"(A), but it will end up as (B),\" while 「たら最後」 means \"when (A), it will end up as (B).\" Although this nuance is slightly different, they are used almost completely interchangeably.\n\nBecause 「最後」 is primarily seen before the comma in these types of sentences, it can be easy to think that it is connected to the 「が」 or 「たら」. However, it is actually more correctly connected logically to the (B) half of the sentence and states that the \"final state\" will end up being that way.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nOccasionally, the (B) phrase will be omitted from these sentences when the negative result is obvious.",
