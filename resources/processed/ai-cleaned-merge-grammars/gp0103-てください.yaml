    "etymology": "ください is the polite imperative form of くださる (kudasaru), the honorific version of くれる (kureru) \"give (me).\" It functions as an auxiliary verb when attached to the te-form of another verb.",
    "writeup": "「**てください**」is a polite expression used to request someone to do something. It is typically translated as \"please do (A).\" 「ください」 itself is considered *honorific language*, a form of polite speech used when referring to the actions of others. The base form of this verb is 「くださる」. While 「ください」 is exclusively used for making requests, 「くださる」 is the honorific equivalent of 「くれる」.\n\nIn casual conversation, 「ください」 can be omitted, and the te-form alone can serve as a very casual way of saying \"please do (A).\"",
