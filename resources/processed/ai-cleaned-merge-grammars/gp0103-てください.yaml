    "etymology": "The Japanese grammar point 「てください」 is formed from the te-form of a verb followed by 「ください」. The term 「ください」 itself is the polite imperative form of the verb 「くださる」 (kudasaru), which means \"to give\" in its honorific (sonkeigo) form. 「くださる」 is the respectful equivalent of the more common verb 「くれる」 (kureru), also meaning \"to give\" (from the perspective of the speaker). Therefore, when you say 「〜てください」, you are essentially making a polite request for someone to \"give\" you the action of the verb. This construction reflects a historical linguistic development where the act of someone performing an action for the speaker was conceptualized as 'giving' that action, and the imperative form of this 'giving' verb came to signify a polite command or request.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern **Verb te-form + ください** (てください) is a fundamental expression in Japanese used to make polite requests or give polite instructions. It is most commonly translated as \"please do (something)\". For example, 「読んでください」 means \"please read\", and 「食べてください」 means \"please eat\".\n\nAt its core, **ください** is the polite imperative form of the verb **くださる** (kudasaru), which is the honorific equivalent of **くれる** (kureru), both meaning \"to give\" (from the perspective of the speaker). Therefore, when you use 「〜てください」, you are essentially making a polite request for the listener to 'give' you the action of the verb. This construction makes it a highly versatile and commonly used polite expression in daily conversation.\n\nWhile **てください** is polite, it is a direct request. For higher levels of politeness or to make a more indirect suggestion, other expressions like **〜ていただけませんか** might be used.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **Casual Usage:** In very casual conversation, especially among close friends or family, the **ください** portion can be omitted, leaving just the **て-form** of the verb (e.g., 「読んで」 instead of 「読んでください」). This shortened form is highly informal and carries a very direct, sometimes slightly commanding, tone. Its appropriateness depends entirely on the relationship between speakers and the context. Using it with someone you don't know well or in a formal setting would be considered rude.\n*   **Negative Requests:** To politely ask someone *not* to do something, the negative **ないで-form** of the verb is used with **ください**. For example, 「食べないでください」 means \"please don't eat\", and 「行かないでください」 means \"please don't go\". This is a common and important variation of the pattern.",
