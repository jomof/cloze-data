    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てください」 is derived from the verb 「くださる」 (kudasaru), which is the honorific form of 「くれる」 (kureru), meaning \"to give\". In this context, 「ください」 functions as a polite imperative, essentially asking someone to \"give\" the action of the verb.",
    "writeup": "「てください」 is a polite expression used to request someone to do something. It is typically translated as \"please do (A)\". The 「ください」 portion is classified as honorific language (敬語, keigo), a specific type of polite speech used to refer to the actions of others. The base form of the verb is 「くださる」, which is the respectful equivalent of 「くれる」 (to give).\n\nIn casual conversation, particularly among close friends or family, the 「ください」 can be omitted, leaving only the 「て」 form of the verb. This highly casual form conveys a very direct and informal request, equivalent to \"please do (A)\". However, judicious use of this shortened form is paramount; its appropriateness hinges entirely on the speaker's relationship with the listener and the specific social context.",
