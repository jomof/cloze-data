    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てください」 is derived from the verb 「くださる」 (kudasaru), which is the honorific form of 「くれる」 (kureru), meaning \"to give\". In this context, 「ください」 functions as a polite imperative, essentially asking someone to \"give\" the action of the verb.",
    "writeup": "「てください」 is a polite expression used to request someone to do something. It's typically translated as \"please do (A)\". The 「ください」 part is classified as honorific language (敬語, keigo), which is a form of polite speech used to refer to others' actions. 「くださる」 is the base form of the verb, equivalent to 「くれる」 but in a more respectful manner.\n\nIn casual conversation, 「ください」 can sometimes be omitted, leaving only the 「て」 form, which functions as a very casual way of saying \"please do (A)\". However, it's essential to understand the context and relationship with the other speaker when using this shortened form.",
