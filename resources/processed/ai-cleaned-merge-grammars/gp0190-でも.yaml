    "etymology": "The particle でも is often considered to be a combination of で and も. で indicates a state or location, and も means 'also' or 'even'. Thus, でも can express 'even in that state/location' or 'in addition to that'.",
    "writeup": "でも (demo) is one of many adverbial particles (副助詞 - fukujoshi) in Japanese. Adverbial particles attach to words, similar to regular particles, but add specific meaning or nuance. One of the primary uses of でも is for \"presenting examples\" (例示 - reiji). This implies that what is presented is merely one of many choices or possibilities, emphasizing the fundamental meaning of \"even\" or \"even if it were~.\" \n\nSpecifically, when でも is attached to a noun, it conveys a nuance of inclusion, meaning \"even ~,\" \"even something like ~,\" or \"even if it's ~,\" suggesting that something is possible or included. For instance, in \"スプーンでも開く\" (A can will open even with a spoon), it expresses surprise or ease, indicating that even an unexpected or simple tool like a spoon can be used. \n\nWhen でも follows an interrogative word (like 誰 - who, どこ - where, 何 - what, いつ - when, どれ - which), it means \"no matter who/what/where/when/which,\" encompassing all possibilities. This creates strong phrases such as 誰でも (anyone/everyone), どこでも (anywhere), なんでも (anything), いつでも (anytime), and どれでも (any one). This signifies a comprehensive \"any/every ~.\" \n\n**Etymological Consideration:** \nIt is widely believed that でも is actually formed from the combination of the particles で (de) and も (mo). で typically indicates means, place, or state, while も means \"also\" or \"even,\" expanding the scope. The combination of these two is thought to have formed the fundamental meaning of でも as \"even in that state or method\" or \"including even such things.\" \n\n**Pronunciation Note:** \nWhen でも follows 何 (nani), its pronunciation almost always changes to なんでも (nandemo). While なにでも (nanidemo) is not strictly incorrect, なんでも is generally more natural and fluid.",
