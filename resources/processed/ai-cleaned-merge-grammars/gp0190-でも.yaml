    "etymology": "でも is thought to be a combination of the particle で (de), indicating location or means, and も (mo), meaning 'also' or 'even'. This combination creates the sense of 'even with' or 'even in the case of'.",
    "writeup": "でも (demo) is a versatile particle with several meanings, but in this case, it functions to present examples or express 'even' or 'or something'. It is attached directly to nouns or pronouns. When used with regular nouns, it indicates that the noun is just one example among other possibilities.\n\nWhen used with interrogative words like 誰 (dare - who), どこ (doko - where), 何 (nani - what), いつ (itsu - when), the meaning shifts to 'anyone,' 'anywhere,' 'anything,' or 'anytime,' respectively. For example, 誰でも (dare demo) means 'anyone' or 'no matter who.'\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   When でも is used with 何 (nani), it is almost always pronounced なん (nan) as in なんでも (nan demo).",
