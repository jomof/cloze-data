formation:
  な-Adjective stem + に + Verb: Transforms a な-adjective into an adverb to modify a verb, describing the
    manner in which the action is performed.
  な-Adjective stem + に + Adjective (e.g., 優しい): Transforms a な-adjective into an adverb to modify another
    adjective, indicating the degree or manner of that adjective.
  な-Adjective stem + に + なる/する: Used with auxiliary verbs like 「なる」 (to become) or 「する」 (to make/do) to
    express a change of state or to cause something to become a certain way. For example, 「綺麗になる」 (to
    become clean/beautiful).
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Used to describe the manner or state of an action or quality, often emphasizing 'how'
    something is done or 'in what manner' something exists. This form is grammatically neutral regarding
    formality, with overall sentence politeness determined by the main verb.
  function: To modify verbs, other adjectives, or auxiliary verbs (like なる, する), transforming the descriptive
    quality of a な-adjective into an adverbial modifier.
  nuance: The addition of 「に」 to the stem of a な-adjective allows it to function as an adverb, describing
    the way an action is performed or the state of something. It converts the descriptive noun-like quality
    of a な-adjective into a dynamic modifier. Unlike い-adjectives, which change their ending to form adverbs,
    な-adjectives require the particle 「に」.
  grammatical-role: Adverbial modifier
etymology: The particle 「に」 is an old case particle in Japanese, one of the most versatile, indicating
  various roles such as location, direction, time, purpose, and result. In the context of な-adjectives,
  its use to form adverbs can be seen as marking the state or condition that something is in or into which
  something changes. Na-adjectives themselves are a unique category, historically behaving like nouns
  that could be directly connected to nouns with 「の」, and to verbs with particles like 「に」 to indicate
  manner or state. This adverbial usage with 「に」 highlights the conversion of a static quality into a
  dynamic description of an action.
writeup: |-
  The adverbial form of な-adjectives is created by taking the stem of the な-adjective and adding the particle 「に」. This transformation allows the な-adjective to modify verbs or other adjectives, describing the manner or state of the action or quality. Unlike い-adjectives, which change their final 「い」 to 「く」 to become adverbs (e.g., 「早い」 (hayai) becomes 「早く」 (hayaku)), な-adjectives require the particle 「に」.

  For instance, 「静かな」 (shizukana) means "quiet" as an adjective, as in 「静かな場所」 (shizukana basho - a quiet place). When you want to say "quietly," you use its adverbial form 「静かに」 (shizukani), as in 「静かに話す」 (shizukani hanasu - to speak quietly). Here, 「静かに」 describes *how* one speaks.

  This 「に」 form is also commonly used with verbs like 「なる」 (to become) or 「する」 (to do/make). For example, 「綺麗になる」 (kirei ni naru) means "to become clean" or "to become beautiful," indicating a change of state. Similarly, 「簡単にする」 (kantan ni suru) means "to make something simple."

  Understanding this distinction is crucial, as the choice between the adjectival form (な + Noun) and the adverbial form (な-stem + に + Verb/Adjective) depends on what you intend to modify.

  - term: な-Adjective (modifying nouns)
    meaning: Directly modifies a noun, as in 'quiet place'.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: This form uses the 「な」 particle to connect to and describe a noun, e.g., 「静かな 場所」 (a quiet
      place). In contrast, 「静かに」 modifies a verb or adjective, describing *how* an action is performed
      or *how* something is.
    grammar_point: な-Adjective (modifying nouns)
  - term: い-Adjective (connecting and adverbial form)
    meaning: Forms an adverb by changing the ending from 「い」 to 「く」, e.g., 「早く」 (quickly).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both な-adjective + 「に」 and い-adjective + 「く」 create adverbs, their formation rules are
      distinct. For example, 「早く」 is from 「早い」, whereas 「静かに」 is from 「静か」. The structural difference
      is key.
    grammar_point: い-Adjective (connecting and adverbial form)
  - term: と (manner)
    meaning: A particle that can also form adverbs, often emphasizing a state, sound, or sudden action,
      e.g., 「しっかり と」 (firmly).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both 「に」 and 「と」 can function adverbially, but 「と」 often adds a nuance of distinctness, completeness,
      or a specific sound/motion (e.g., 「きらきらと輝く」 - to sparkle brightly). 「に」 is the standard adverbializer
      for な-adjectives and has a broader, less specific nuance of manner.
    grammar_point: と (manner)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between the adverbial use of な-adjectives with 「に」 and
  other similar forms, remember that 「な」 directly precedes and describes a noun, whereas 「に」 allows the
  adjective to describe a verb or another adjective. For い-adjectives, the adverbial form is created by
  replacing 「い」 with 「く」, which is a different internal conjugation. While 「と」 can also form adverbs,
  it often carries a more specific or emphatic nuance related to sounds, suddenness, or distinctness,
  compared to the general adverbial function of 「に」 for な-adjectives.

        english: Please use a quiet way of speaking in the library.
        hint: This uses '静かな' to describe '話し方' (way of speaking), but we're looking for an adverb modifying
          the verb '話す' directly. We want to say 'speak quietly'.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 病院 は 静か な 場所 です。
        english: The hospital is a quiet place.
        hint: This is a statement about the hospital's nature, not an instruction on how to speak. We
          are looking for an imperative modifying the verb '話す'.
    scene: A nurse addressing visitors in a hospital.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    nuance: While 「大声で」 uses 「で」 for means/manner (a common way to form adverbs from nouns or adjectives),
      this example still demonstrates the principle of adverbial modification of a verb, similar to な-adjective
      + に. The phrase 「大声で話さないでください」 directly tells someone *how* not to speak, using an adverbial phrase
      derived from a noun. This contrasts with the direct adjectival modification or simply stating a
      characteristic of the place.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, the な-adjective stem + 「に」 construction is versatile
  and essential for describing the manner in which actions are performed or states are achieved. It allows
  for precise and natural expression of adverbial concepts in Japanese.
