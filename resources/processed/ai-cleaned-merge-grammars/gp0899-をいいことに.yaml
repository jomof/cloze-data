        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "General, often implies exploitation or irresponsible behavior.",
        "function": "Expresses that a situation or condition is being used as a convenient opportunity, usually for actions that are seen as inappropriate, morally questionable, or self-serving.",
        "nuance": "Implies that someone is exploiting circumstances for their own gain, often with a negative or critical connotation. While it can occasionally describe a neutral or slightly positive action of making the most of an opportunity, its common usage suggests a lack of ethics or responsibility.",
        "grammatical-role": "Adverbial phrase modifying the subsequent action or predicate.",
        "temporal-flow": "The action of taking advantage occurs concurrently with or prior to the subsequent action."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「をいいことに」 combines the particle 「を」, the adjective 「良い(いい)」 (good), the noun 「こと」 (thing, event), and the particle 「に」. It literally means \"making something good,\" but it carries the nuance of exploiting a situation for personal gain. This construction frames a situation as 'good' or 'convenient' for one's purposes, often to achieve an undesirable outcome.",
    "writeup": "「をいいことに」 is an expression meaning \"to take advantage of\" something. It implies using a situation or circumstance as a convenient opportunity for actions that are often morally or socially problematic, irresponsible, or inappropriate. While it literally translates to \"making something good,\" its nuance is precisely captured by the English phrase \"to take advantage of.\"\n\nThis grammatical structure typically follows verbs in plain form, い-adjectives, な-adjective stems, and nouns. It is always preceded by 「の」 or 「なの」, adhering to standard nominalization rules, or can directly follow a noun when that noun is the object of exploitation. For instance, you will encounter forms like 「顔が 見えない の をいいことに」 (taking advantage of not being seen), 「優しい の をいいことに」 (taking advantage of someone's kindness), or 「休みな の をいいことに」 (taking advantage of being on vacation).\n\nIt is also very common to see 「をいいことにして」 with the addition of 「～して」 (the te-form of する), which does not significantly alter the meaning or emphasis. This expression is frequently used in both daily conversation and written language, and its usage is not limited by specific age groups or genders.",

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「をいいことに」, 「を契機に」 implies that the event serves as a neutral or positive trigger or catalyst for something to happen, without necessarily involving exploitation or negative behavior."

        {
            "term": "を言い訳に",
            "meaning": "To use as an excuse",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While both involve using a situation, 「を言い訳に」 focuses specifically on using something as a justification or reason to avoid responsibility or explain an action. 「をいいことに」 emphasizes exploiting a situation for one's own gain, often with less focus on justification."
        },
        {
            "term": "を良い機会に",
            "meaning": "Taking a good opportunity, seizing a chance",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "This phrase has a neutral to positive connotation, referring to utilizing a favorable chance for a constructive purpose. In contrast, 「をいいことに」 almost always carries a negative nuance of exploitation or taking unfair advantage."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「をいいことに」 can share some superficial similarities with other phrases, it is crucial to understand its distinct nuance. Unlike the neutral or positive connotations of 「を契機に」 or 「を良い機会に」 which indicate using an event or opportunity for generally acceptable outcomes, 「をいいことに」 specifically carries a negative implication. It implies an act of exploitation, where a situation is opportunistically used for one's own benefit, often in an unethical or irresponsible manner. Similarly, while 「を言い訳に」 involves using a situation, its focus is on providing a justification for an action, whereas 「をいいことに」 is about actively capitalizing on a circumstance for personal gain, disregarding propriety.",
