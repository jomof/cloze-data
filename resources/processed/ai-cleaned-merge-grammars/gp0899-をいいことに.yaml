    "etymology": "The grammar point 「をいいことに」 combines the particle 「を」, the adjective 「良い(いい)」 (good), the noun 「こと」 (thing, event), and the particle 「に」. It literally means \"making something good,\" but it carries the nuance of exploiting a situation for personal gain.",
    "writeup": "「をいいことに」 is an expression meaning \"to take advantage of\" something. It implies using a situation or circumstance as a convenient opportunity for actions that are often morally or socially problematic, irresponsible, or inappropriate. While it literally translates to \"making something good,\" its nuance is precisely captured by the English phrase \"to take advantage of.\"\n\nThis grammatical structure typically follows verbs in plain form, い-adjectives, な-adjective stems, and nouns. It is always preceded by 「の」 or 「なの」, adhering to standard nominalization rules. For instance, you will encounter forms like 「顔が見えない**のを**いいことに」 (taking advantage of not being seen), 「優しい**のを**いいことに」 (taking advantage of someone's kindness), or 「休みな**のを**いいことに」 (taking advantage of being on vacation).\n\nIt is also very common to see 「をいいことにして」 with the addition of 「～して」 (the te-form of する), which does not significantly alter the meaning or emphasis. This expression is frequently used in both daily conversation and written language, and its usage is not limited by specific age groups or genders.",
