    "etymology": "The grammar point 「をいいことに」 combines the particle 「を」, the adjective 「良い(いい)」 (good), the noun 「こと」 (thing, event), and the particle 「に」. It literally means \"making something good,\" but it carries the nuance of exploiting a situation for personal gain.",
    "writeup": "「をいいことに」 expresses the idea of taking advantage of a situation, condition, or someone's characteristic, often with a negative connotation. It implies that someone is using something as a convenient excuse or opportunity to do something they might not otherwise do, or to exploit a situation for their own benefit. It's similar to \"taking advantage of\" in English. This grammar point is commonly used in everyday speech and writing and is not particularly gender- or age-specific.",
