    "etymology": "The grammar point 「をいいことに」 combines the particle 「を」, the adjective 「良い(いい)」 (good), the noun 「こと」 (thing, event), and the particle 「に」. It literally means \"making something good,\" but it carries the nuance of exploiting a situation for personal gain.",
    "writeup": "「をいいことに」は、「～を都合のいい機会として利用する」というニュアンスを持つ表現です。多くの場合、その利用行為には道徳的あるいは社会的に**問題がある**、または**不適切な**行為が含まれます。直訳すると「～を良いことにして」となりますが、英語の \"to take advantage of\" に相当します。\n\n動詞の普通形、イ形容詞、ナ形容詞の語幹、名詞に続きますが、常に**「の」**または**「なの」**を介して接続されます。例えば、「顔が見えない**のを**いいことに」、「優しい**のを**いいことに」、「休みな**のを**いいことに」といった形です。\n\nまた、**「をいいことにして」**のように「～して」を伴う形も非常に一般的であり、意味や強調に大きな変化はありません。この表現は日常会話や書き言葉で頻繁に用いられ、特定の年齢層や性別によって使用が限定されることはありません。",
