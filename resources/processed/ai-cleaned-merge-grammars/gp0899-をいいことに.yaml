    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from 「良い」 (ii, good) and 「こと」 (koto, thing). The literal sense is making the 'good thing' of something, but the implied meaning is to exploit a situation.",
    "writeup": "「をいいことに」 is an expression that means \"to take advantage of\" or \"to exploit\" something. It implies that someone is using a situation, condition, or characteristic as a convenient excuse or opportunity, often with a negative connotation. The structure combines 「を」, the い-adjective 「良い」 (good), the noun 「こと」 (thing), and the particle 「に」. The phrase often suggests that the action taken is somewhat immoral, irresponsible, or opportunistic. It is commonly seen following nouns with 「である/なの」 or verbs in casual form with 「の」.",
