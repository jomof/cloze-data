    "etymology": "「極み (きわみ)」 literally means 'extremity,' 'height,' or 'limit.' When used with 「の」, it intensifies the preceding noun, indicating that something has reached its utmost degree.",

It is a formal expression often found in writing or formal speech, emphasizing that something has reached the highest or most intense level of whatever it describes. Because 「極み」 itself is a noun, it is often followed by 「だ」.",
