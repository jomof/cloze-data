    "writeup": "「の極み」 (no kiwami) is used to express that something is the **ultimate**, **extreme**, or **epitome** of a certain quality or state. It's a formal expression often found in writing or formal speech. It emphasizes that something has reached the highest or most intense level of whatever it describes. Because 「極み」 itself is a noun, it is often followed by 「だ」. \n\nImportant considerations:\n*   It is paired with nouns.\n*   It is used to emphasize a high degree of something, whether positive or negative.\n*   It's a more formal expression.",
