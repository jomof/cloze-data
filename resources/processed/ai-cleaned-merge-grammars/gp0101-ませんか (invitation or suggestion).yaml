jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: teineigo (polite)
  particle-pragmatic-function: agreement-seeking
etymology: The grammar point 「ませんか」 is derived from the ます form of a verb, conjugated into its negative
  form 「ません」, followed by the question particle 「か」. This construction creates a polite question implying
  an invitation or suggestion. 「ます」 indicates politeness, 「ません」 negates the verb, and 「か」 turns the phrase
  into a question.
writeup: |-
  「ませんか」 is a polite expression used to invite someone to do something with you or to make a suggestion. It is equivalent to asking, "Won't you do (A) with me?" or "Would you like to?". This expression is inherently polite, making it suitable for use with people you don't know well or in more formal situations.

  While similar to 「ましょうか」, 「ませんか」 more directly conveys an invitation. 「ましょうか」, on the other hand, often sounds more like a general suggestion or an offer from the speaker to perform an action. For example, 「手伝いましょうか」 (Shall I help you?) is an offer, whereas 「手伝いませんか」 (Won't you help?) is an invitation to the listener to take the action of helping.

  The casual equivalent of 「ませんか」 is 「ないか」. While 「ませんか」 maintains a polite and inviting tone, 「ないか」 can be a more direct, and sometimes forceful, suggestion or invitation. It is generally reserved for use among close friends or in situations where politeness is not paramount.

  To emphasize that you want to do something 'together', you can add 「一緒に (いっしょに)」, meaning 'together', for clarification. This helps reinforce the collaborative nature of the invitation.
false_friends:
  - term: たらどう
    meaning: Why don't you?, What if you did...?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「ませんか」 which is an invitation, 「たらどう」 is a suggestion about an action that would benefit
      the listener, often implying advice or a recommendation.
    grammar_point: たらどう (how about)
  - term: ましょう
    meaning: Let's, Shall we (Polite volitional)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「ましょう」 expresses the speaker's intention or a general suggestion for both speaker and listener.
      「ませんか」, however, is an active invitation to the listener to participate. 「ましょう」 is more about expressing
      your will or proposing a course of action, whereas 「ませんか」 seeks agreement or participation from
      the listener specifically.
    grammar_point: ましょう (polite volitional or suggestion)
  - term: Verb[ましょう]+か
    meaning: Shall we, Shall I
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「ましょうか」 is often used when offering help or suggesting an action for the benefit of the listener
      or both the speaker and listener. 「ませんか」, on the other hand, is more directly an invitation to do
      something together or to invite the listener to perform an action with the speaker.
    grammar_point: Verb[ましょう]+か (polite offer or suggestion)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「たらどう」, 「ましょう」, and 「〜ましょうか」 might seem interchangeable with 「ませんか」,
  they have distinct nuances. 「たらどう」 suggests a course of action for the listener's benefit, 「ましょう」 expresses
  the speaker's intention, and 「〜ましょうか」 is often an offer of help or a suggestion. Use 「ませんか」 when you
  genuinely want to invite someone to do something with you, emphasizing their participation.

    japanese:
      - 今夜、家 で テレビ を {見 ませ ん か}。
      - 今夜、家 で テレビ、{見 ませ ん か}。
      - 今夜、私 の 家 で テレビ を {見 ませ ん か}。

          - 今夜、家 で テレビ を 見 ましょう か。
        english: Tonight, shall we watch TV at home? (Offer/Suggestion)
        hint: 「ましょうか」 is more of an offer or a general suggestion rather than a direct invitation seeking
          the listener's participation. We're looking for an active invitation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今夜、家 で テレビ を 見 ない か。
        english: Tonight, won't you watch TV at home? (Casual)
        hint: 「ないか」 is a casual form of invitation that can sometimes sound more direct or even forceful
          among close friends. We're looking for a polite and warm invitation.
    scene: A friend inviting another friend over for a casual evening.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「見ませんか」 makes this a polite yet warm and direct invitation. When used by a female
      speaker to another female friend in a friendly setting, it signals a desire for their company without
      being overly formal or insistent. The speaker is genuinely interested in having the listener join
      them for the activity, conveying a sense of closeness within polite speech.
    etymology: The phrase 「今夜、家で」 emphasizes the specific setting and time for the proposed activity.
      「テレビ」 is a loanword from English, referring to 'television', commonly used in everyday Japanese.
  - english: Won't you read this book with me?
    japanese:
      - この 本、一緒 に {読み ませ ん か}。
      - この 本 を 一緒 に {読み ませ ん か}。
    english_literally: This book, together, won't you read?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本、一緒 に 読み ましょう か。
        english: Shall we read this book together? (General suggestion)
        hint: 「ましょうか」 proposes a shared action but is less about inviting participation and more about
          suggesting a joint activity. We're looking for a gentle invitation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本、一緒 に 読ま ない か。
        english: Won't you read this book together? (Casual/Direct)
        hint: 「ないか」 is a casual form of invitation suitable for very close relations but might lack the
          warmth or politeness needed for a gentle suggestion to a child. We're looking for a polite invitation.
    scene: A parent suggests reading a storybook with their child.
    register: shitashii kuchō (intimate)
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The inclusion of 「一緒に」 emphasizes the desire for a shared activity. When an older female speaker
      (parent) uses 「読みませんか」 towards a younger male listener (child), it is a warm and encouraging invitation
      to engage in an activity together. This fosters a sense of shared experience and bonding, acting
      as a soft way to propose an activity rather than simply asking.
    etymology: 「本 (ほん)」 is a fundamental Japanese word for 'book', with roots in classical Chinese characters
      for 'root' or 'origin', hinting at written sources. 「読む (よむ)」 means 'to read'.

        english: Shall we all go hiking this weekend? (General suggestion)
        hint: While similar, 「ましょうか」 is often used for suggesting a general plan, whereas 「ませんか」 is more
          directly inviting participation from the group. We're looking for an inclusive invitation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 週末 に みんな で ハイキング に 行か ない か。
        english: Why don't we all go hiking this weekend? (Casual/Assertive)
        hint: 「ないか」 is a casual form that can be used among very close friends, but it lacks the polite
          and inclusive tone of 「ませんか」 in a group setting. We're looking for a friendly, polite group
          invitation.
    scene: A group of friends is brainstorming ideas for a weekend outing. One friend suggests hiking.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The inclusion of 「みんなで」 (everyone together) clearly indicates a group activity. When a male
      speaker uses 「行きませんか」 to a group of friends, it creates an inclusive way to propose an activity,
      encouraging collective decision-making and participation from everyone. It maintains a polite yet
      casual atmosphere among peers.
    etymology: 「週末 (しゅうまつ)」 is a compound word meaning 'end of the week'. 「ハイキング」 is a loanword from English
      'hiking'.
  - english: Won't we have lunch together next week?
    japanese:
      - 来週、一緒 に ランチ を {食べ ませ ん か}。

          - 来週、一緒 に ランチ を 食べ ましょう か。
        english: Shall we have lunch together next week? (General suggestion)
        hint: 「ましょうか」 is a more general suggestion or offer, which might be less direct for an invitation
          in a professional context. We're looking for a polite invitation for joint activity.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 来週、一緒 に ランチ を 食べ たら どう です か。
        english: How about having lunch together next week?
        hint: 「たらどうですか」 is more of a suggestion or advice, implying it would be good for the listener
          to do something, rather than a mutual invitation. We're looking for a joint invitation.
    scene: A colleague proposes a casual lunch meeting to a coworker.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「食べませんか」 in this professional context (even for a casual lunch) emphasizes a polite
      invitation rather than just a suggestion. When a male colleague uses this to a female coworker,
      it conveys respect and a desire for mutual engagement. The addition of 「一緒に」 reinforces the shared
      nature of the activity.
    etymology: 「来週 (らいしゅう)」 means 'next week'. 「ランチ」 is a loanword from English 'lunch'. 「食べる (たべる)」 means
      'to eat'.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 新しい ゲーム を 一緒 に 買い に 行き ましょう か。
        english: Shall we go buy a new game together? (General suggestion)
        hint: 「ましょうか」 offers a general plan. 「ませんか」 is more direct in inviting the listener to join the
          action. We're looking for an invitation that expresses the speaker's desire for the listener's
          company.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新しい ゲーム を 買い に 行か ない か。
        english: Why don't we go buy a new game? (Casual/Assertive)
        hint: While 「ないか」 is more casual, it can be perceived as more assertive than the polite 「ませんか」,
          which is more appropriate for a younger sibling asking an older one. We're looking for a polite
          request.
    scene: A younger sibling sees an advertisement for a new video game and wants their older sibling
      to accompany them to buy it.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The inclusion of 「一緒に」 emphasizes the desire for a shared activity. When a younger male sibling
      uses 「買いに 行きませんか」 to an older female sibling, it implies a polite request or invitation. This acknowledges
      the older sibling's potential authority or busy schedule while still hoping for their company, conveying
      a sense of anticipation and shared interest.
    etymology: 「新しい (あたらしい)」 means 'new'. 「ゲーム」 is a loanword from English 'game'. 「買いに行く (かいに いく)」 means
      'to go buy'.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 今晩、お 夕食 は いかが です か。
        english: Tonight, how about dinner?
        hint: 「いかがですか」 is a general polite inquiry or suggestion, not a direct invitation for mutual participation
          in the same way 「ませんか」 is. We're looking for an active invitation to join.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今晩、私 たち と お 夕食 を ご 一緒 に し ましょう か。
        english: Tonight, shall we have dinner together?
        hint: 「〜ましょうか」 can imply an offer or a general suggestion, which is less directly inviting the
          listener's explicit participation than 「ませんか」. We're looking for a clear invitation.
    scene: A business professional is inviting a potential new client to dinner to build rapport.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of the honorific prefix 「お」 before 「夕食」 and the humble expression 「ご一緒し」 (as part
      of ご一緒しませんか) elevates the politeness, suitable for a formal business context. When a male speaker
      uses 「ご一緒しませんか」 towards a female client, it conveys utmost respect and a serious, yet cordial, invitation,
      ensuring the client feels valued and comfortable.
    etymology: 「ご一緒する (ごいっしょする)」 means 'to accompany' or 'to do together' in a humble form, emphasizing
      respect towards the person one is joining. 「夕食 (ゆうしょく)」 means 'dinner'.

      - competing_japanese:
          - この 新しい コーヒー を 飲ん だら どう です か。
        english: How about trying this new coffee?
        hint: 「〜たらどうですか」 is a suggestion, often implying advice or a recommendation, rather than a direct,
          polite invitation to taste. We're looking for an invitation to try.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 新しい コーヒー を お 試し に なり ます か。
        english: Would you like to try this new coffee? (Highly formal/honorific)
        hint: While very polite, this phrase is more of a formal inquiry about their desire, whereas 「飲んでみませんか」
          is a warmer, more direct invitation to actually try it. We're looking for a friendly invitation.
    scene: A barista at a new coffee shop offers a sample to a customer.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The combination of the て-form + 「みる」 (to try) with 「ませんか」 creates a polite invitation to experience
      something. When a female barista uses 「飲んでみませんか」 towards a male customer, it's a welcoming and encouraging
      way to introduce a new product, fostering a friendly and approachable atmosphere without being overly
      familiar or pushy.
    etymology: 「コーヒー」 is a loanword from English 'coffee'. 「試す (ためす)」 or 「見てみる (みてみる)」 when connected
      to the te-form of a verb, means to 'try doing' or 'do and see'.
  - english: Won't you please sit here?

      - competing_japanese:
          - どうぞ、こちら へ お 座り ください。
        english: Please, sit here. (Polite command)
        hint: 「〜ください」 is a polite command or request, which can sound more direct or imperative than a
          softer invitation. We're looking for a gentle, respectful invitation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - こちら の 席 は いかが です か。
        english: How about this seat?
        hint: This is a general polite inquiry about a seat's suitability, not a direct invitation to
          take it. We're looking for a clear invitation to sit.
    scene: A train attendant offers an elderly passenger a vacant seat in a crowded train.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: supportive
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of the honorific verb 「お座りになる」 (to sit) combined with 「ませんか」 forms a highly respectful
      and considerate invitation. When a younger female attendant uses this towards an older female passenger,
      it demonstrates high regard and empathy, offering comfort while maintaining appropriate social distance
      and politeness. 「どうぞ」 further softens the request, making it even more welcoming.
    etymology: 「座る (すわる)」 means 'to sit'. 「お〜になる」 is a common honorific verb construction meaning 'to
      do X (respectfully)'. 「どうぞ」 is an interjection used to offer or encourage.
  - english: Why don't we review this section together?

          - この セクション を 一緒 に 復習 し ましょう。
        english: Let's review this section together. (Volitional/Suggestion)
        hint: 「〜ましょう」 expresses a joint intention or suggestion, but it is less about inviting the listener's
          active agreement and more about stating a proposed action. We're looking for an invitation for
          collaboration.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この セクション を 復習 し たら どう です か。
        english: How about reviewing this section?
        hint: 「〜たらどうですか」 is a suggestion for a course of action that might benefit the listener, implying
          advice rather than a mutual invitation to work together. We're looking for a proposal that involves
          mutual agreement.

      of their coursework.

    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The inclusion of 「一緒に」 emphasizes the collaborative nature of the activity, indicating that
      the tutor intends to work alongside the students. When a male tutor uses 「復習しませんか」 with a group
      of students, it creates an inclusive and supportive learning environment, encouraging participation
      and mutual effort in mastering the material. It's a gentle way to guide them toward reviewing without
      sounding authoritative.
    etymology: 「復習 (ふくしゅう)」 is a noun (and verb when する is added) meaning 'review' or 'revision'. It's
      composed of 復 (fuku - return/repeat) and 習 (shuu - shuu - learn/practice).

        english: Will you come over to my place later? (Casual question)
        hint: 「来る？」 is a very casual, direct question that lacks the gentle invitational nuance of 「ませんか」,
          suitable only for very close friends. We're looking for a polite, friendly invitation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 後 で 私 の 家 に 来 たい？
        english: Do you want to come over to my place later?
        hint: 「来たい？」 directly asks about the listener's desire, which can feel less like an open invitation
          and more like a probe. We're looking for an inviting proposition.
    scene: A friend sends a text message to another friend, inviting them to hang out.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: Despite being polite, 「来ませんか」 can be used among friends to convey a warm and approachable
      invitation, especially in written communication like text messages. When a female speaker uses this
      towards another female friend, it suggests a comfortable familiarity within polite boundaries, allowing
      for a relaxed atmosphere while still showing consideration for the other person's schedule or preferences.
    etymology: 「後で (あとで)」 means 'later'. 「家 (うち/いえ)」 means 'house' or 'home'. 「来る (くる)」 means 'to come'.
  - english: Won't you take a look at these materials?
    japanese:

          - この 資料 を ご覧 に なり ます か。
        english: Would you like to look at these materials? (Formal inquiry)
        hint: This is a very formal inquiry about willingness, whereas 「見てみませんか」 is a more direct and
          gentle invitation to review. We're looking for a direct, polite invitation to check the materials.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 資料 を 見 て くだ さい。
        english: Please look at these materials. (Polite command)
        hint: 「〜てください」 is a polite command, which can sound less inviting and more directive. We're looking
          for a softer, more collaborative invitation.
    scene: A senior colleague asks a junior colleague to review some important documents.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The combination of the te-form + 「みる」 (to try) with 「ませんか」 allows for a polite and indirect
      way to request an action. When a male senior colleague uses 「見てみませんか」 towards a male junior colleague,
      it conveys respect and offers a choice, making the request sound less like an order and more like
      a collaboration or opportunity. This maintains a harmonious working relationship.
    etymology: 「資料 (しりょう)」 means 'materials' or 'data'. 「見る (みる)」 means 'to see' or 'to look'.
  - english: Why don't we consult a specialist?
    japanese:

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 専門 家 に 相談 し ましょう か。
        english: Shall we consult a specialist? (General suggestion)
        hint: 「ましょうか」 suggests a general course of action. 「ませんか」 is a more direct proposal for joint
          action, implying shared responsibility. We're looking for a joint decision-making invitation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 専門 家 に 相談 し た 方 が いい です よ。
        english: It would be better to consult a specialist.
        hint: 「〜たらどうですか」 is advice, implying a recommendation for the listener, which is less about a
          mutual decision and more about providing guidance. We're looking for a proposal that involves
          mutual agreement.
    scene: Two project managers are discussing a complex problem they are facing.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: Using 「相談しませんか」 allows for a collaborative problem-solving approach. When a female project
      manager uses this with a male colleague, it's a polite and inclusive way to suggest a course of
      action, demonstrating teamwork and seeking mutual agreement. It shows a shared sense of responsibility
      for the project's success.
    etymology: 「専門家 (せんもんか)」 means 'specialist' or 'expert'. 「相談 (そうだん)」 means 'consultation' or 'discussion'.
post_example_writeup: When using 「ませんか」, remember that its primary function is to invite. It seeks the
  listener's agreement or participation in an specific activity. While it often translates to 'Why don't
  we...?', it is distinct from simply making a suggestion or offering assistance. The inclusion of words
  like 「一緒に」 (together) can further emphasize the collaborative nature of the invitation.
