    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the particle 「に」, the て-form of the verb 「至る(いたる)」 (to arrive at, to reach), and the adverbial particle 「も」 (even). The combination suggests reaching an extreme point, and then adding \"even\" to it, implying a surprising or regrettable outcome despite reaching that point.",
    "writeup": "「に至っても」 contrasts with 「に至っては」. While 「に至っては」 highlights the most extreme example *within* a category, 「に至っても」 focuses on an extreme situation where a specific result *doesn't* occur, despite the extremity. The 「も」 (even) emphasizes that despite reaching point (A), (B) still happens (or doesn't). It can be translated as \"even if it came to (A), (B)\" or \"even when (A), (B)\". Often, (B) will be negative, underscoring that even the extreme (A) couldn't change (B). However, it can occasionally be used positively, especially to express determination. 「に至っても」 often expresses lament or regret that something didn't change even after reaching point (A).",
