        "nuance": "Often conveys lament or regret that something has not changed despite reaching a significant point, but can also express strong determination."
    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the verb 「至る (itaru)」, meaning \"to arrive at,\" \"to reach,\" or \"to come to.\" The 「に (ni)」 marks the point of arrival, 「至って (itatte)」 is the te-form of the verb indicating a state or condition, and 「も (mo)」 adds the nuance of \"even.\"",
    "writeup": "「に至っても (ni itatte mo)」 expresses that even when a certain extreme or significant situation is reached, a particular result or change does not occur, often with a sense of lament or regret. It's similar to saying \"even if things get to this point...\" (something else still doesn't happen).\n\nUnlike 「に至っては (ni itatte wa)」, which presents the most extreme examples for something from within a specific category, 「に至っても」 focuses on the lack of change or effect despite reaching a critical point. It combines 「に」 (case-marking particle), the te-form of 「至る」, and 「も」 (adverbial particle).\n\nIt's frequently used when the speaker laments or regrets that something hasn't changed despite reaching a certain point, but it can sometimes be used positively to express determination.",
