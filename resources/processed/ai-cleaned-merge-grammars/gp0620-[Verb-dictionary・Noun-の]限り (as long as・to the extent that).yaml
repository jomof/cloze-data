meaning: as long as; to the extent that
pronunciation:
  katakana: カギリ
  romaji: kagiri
formation:
  Verb[dictionary form] + 限り: Expresses a condition that must continue for something to be true, often
    implying 'as long as one continues to do something'.
  Noun + の + 限り: Indicates a limit or extent, meaning 'to the extent of Noun' or 'as long as Noun is the
    case'.
jlpt: N2
etymology: The grammatical expression 限り stems from the noun 限り (limit, boundary, extent), which itself
  is derived from the verb 限る (kagiru), meaning 'to limit' or 'to restrict'. This underlying concept of
  limitation and boundary is central to its usage. When used with a verb in dictionary form, it implies
  a temporal or continuous boundary, such as 'as long as (an action continues)'. When used with a noun,
  it directly refers to the extent or limit of that noun, meaning 'to the extent of'.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「〜限り」 is used to express a condition that holds true, or the maximum extent/limit of something. It can be attached to either a verb in its dictionary (plain) form or a noun followed by の. This construction emphasizes that the validity or occurrence of the main clause is entirely dependent on, or limited by, the condition or extent stated by 「〜限り」.

  When attached to a **verb in dictionary form** (e.g., 知る限り), it means "as long as (the action continues)" or "to the extent that (the verb's state is true)". It defines a continuous condition under which something is valid or takes place. For example, 「生きている限り」 means "as long as one is alive."

  When attached to a **noun followed by の** (e.g., 力の限り), it means "to the extent of the Noun" or "all that the Noun can offer." This often refers to physical or abstract limits, such as one's strength, knowledge, or time. For example, 「声の限り」 means "to the full extent of one's voice," or "with all one's voice."

  This grammar point clearly delineates the scope or condition for a statement, providing a precise boundary.
false_friends:
  - term: だけ
    meaning: only; just
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: だけ simply states a sole quantity or focus, whereas 限り implies a condition or limit that must
      be met or maintained. We're looking for "as long as X," not "only X."
    grammar_point: だけ (only・just)
  - term: しか〜ない
    meaning: only; nothing but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: しか〜ない emphasizes exclusivity, implying "only X and nothing else." 限り sets a condition or boundary
      ("as long as X"), not necessarily excluding other possibilities outside that boundary.
    grammar_point: しか〜ない (only, nothing but)
  - term: つつも
    meaning: even though; despite
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While both involve some ongoing state, つつも expresses a concession ("even though X, Y"), indicating
      something contrary to expectation. 限り defines the boundary or condition under which something is
      true ("as long as X, Y").
    grammar_point: つつも (even though, despite・internal conflict or contradiction)
  - term: あいだ
    meaning: while; during
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: あいだ focuses on the duration during which an action or state occurs. 限り emphasizes the condition
      or extent of that action/state. 限り often implies a continuous dependency.
    grammar_point: あいだ (between・among・while・during)
  - term: うちに
    meaning: while; before something changes
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: うちに emphasizes doing something before a state changes or while an opportunity exists. 限り focuses
      on the condition or limit under which something is true, often implying 'as long as' a situation
      persists.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary・い-Adj・な-Adj・Nounの]うちに (while a state continues)'
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「〜限り」 can sometimes be translated similarly to "only" or "while," it
  fundamentally establishes a condition or boundary. It specifies the extent to which something is true
  or possible. Unlike 「だけ」 or 「しか〜ない」, which focus on exclusivity, 「〜限り」 defines a scope or condition
  ("as long as", "to the extent that"). Unlike 「あいだ」 or 「うちに」, which are primarily concerned with temporal
  duration or opportunity, 「〜限り」 is about the dependency of one situation on another's continuous state
  or limit. It implies a clear, defining boundary for the statement being made.

        english: According to what I heard, the train should arrive on time.
        hint: 聞くところによると is about what one has heard from others. We're looking for what one personally
          knows.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の 認識 で は、電車 は 時間 通り に 着く はず です。
        english: In my understanding, the train should arrive on time.
        hint: 私の認識では means 'based on my understanding,' which is a statement of personal belief. We're
          looking for a phrase that sets a limit to one's knowledge.
    scene: A person at a train station checking the schedule, responding to a fellow passenger's question.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「知る限り」 is a very common set phrase meaning "to the best of my knowledge" or "as far as I know."
      It indicates the speaker's current knowledge boundary. The variations show polite speech 「着くはずです」,
      more casual 「来るはずだよ」, and a slightly more formal business or explanatory tone with 「私 の 知る限り では」
      and 「定刻 通り に 到着 する はずです」.
  - english: He ran to the best of his ability.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は {力 の 限り} 走っ た。
      - 彼 は {力 の 限り} 走り まし た。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 全力 で 走っ た。
        english: He ran with all his might.
        hint: 全力で means 'with all one's power,' which is a simple adverbial phrase. We're looking for
          a phrase emphasizing the *extent* of his strength.

    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: 「力の限り」 means 'to the full extent of one's strength.' The variations show the plain past 「走った」,
      the polite past 「走りました」, and a slightly more emphasized polite version 「自分の 力の限り、走りました」, highlighting
      'his own' ability.
  - english: As long as there is life, there is hope.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 命 が ある なら、希望 は ある。
        english: If there is life, there is hope.

          of something as a condition.
    scene: A person reflecting on a difficult situation, expressing a philosophical outlook.
    register: bungo (literary)
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「命ある限り」 is a poetic and somewhat literary expression. 「命ある限り、希望はある」 is a common saying. 「命がある限り、希望はあります」
      is a polite, slightly more conversational version. 「命ある限りは、希望が存在する」 adds emphasis with 「は」 and uses
      the more formal 「存在する」 for 'exist', leaning towards a philosophical or formal discourse.
  - english: As far as my memory serves, this is the first time I've met him.
    japanese:
      - '{私 の 記憶 の 限り}、彼 に 会う の は 初めて です。'

        english: In my memory, this is the first time I've met him.
        hint: 私の記憶では implies 'based on my memory,' which is a slightly different nuance. We're looking
          for a phrase that expresses the *full extent* of one's memory.
    scene: Introducing someone at a formal event, and trying to recall if you've met before.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「私 の 記憶 の 限り」 means 'to the extent of my memory.' The first variation is standard polite.
      The second 「私 の 記憶 の 限り じゃ、初めてだよ」 is casual, using 「じゃ」 (contraction of では) and 「だよ」. The third
      variation 「私 の 記憶 の 限り では、お会い する の は 初めてかと 存じます」 uses highly formal and humble language (お会いする,
      存じます) suitable for very professional or respectful settings.

    register: bijinesu nihongo (business)
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「在庫がある限り」 means 'as long as there is stock.' The first variation is polite business Japanese.
      The second 「継続いたします」 is a more formal and emphatic business phrasing. The third 「在庫ある限りは、売るよ」 is
      a very casual, simplified version, dropping 「が」 and using a casual ending, which would be inappropriate
      in a formal business announcement but possible in a casual internal conversation.
  - english: I will do my best for the remaining time.
    japanese:
      - '{残さ れ た 時間 の 限り}、ベスト を 尽くし ます。'
      - '{残さ れ た 時間 の 限り}、ベスト を 尽くす。'
      - '{残さ れ た 時間 の 限り}、最大 限 努力 いたし ます。'

    scene: A student speaking to their study group before a final exam.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「残された 時間 の 限り」 means 'to the extent of the remaining time.' The first variation is standard
      polite. The second 「尽くす」 is the plain form, suitable for casual contexts or direct statements. The
      third 「最大限 努力 いたします」 is more formal and emphasizes 'maximum effort,' suitable for a serious, perhaps
      academic or professional, setting.
  - english: As far as I can see, there's no danger.
    japanese:
      - '{見る 限り}、危険 は ない。'
      - '{見る 限り}、危険 は あり ませ ん。'
      - '{見る 限り}、危険 は 無い な。'
    english_literally: As far as I see, danger is not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 見る ところ、危険 は ない。
        english: From what I can see, there's no danger.
        hint: 見るところ is more about a general observation. We're looking for a phrase that states the limit
          of one's visual perception.
    scene: Two hikers assessing a path ahead on a new trail.
    register: casual
    setting: cautious
    nuance: 「見る限り」 means 'as far as one can see.' The first variation is the plain form, common in casual
      conversation. The second 「危険 は ありません」 is the polite form. The third 「危険 は 無い な」 adds a masculine
      and definitive particle 「な」, suitable for a male speaker confidently stating an observation.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 大声 で 叫ん だ。
        english: She shouted loudly.
        hint: 大声で simply means 'with a loud voice.' We're looking for a phrase that emphasizes using the

    scene: Someone recounting a story where a person called out desperately for help.
    register: casual
    setting: emergency/alarm
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「声の限り」 is a common idiom meaning to use one's full voice, as loud as possible. This highlights
      the use of 限り to express the maximum extent of a physical capacity related to the noun 「声」 (voice).
      The variations include the plain past 「叫んだ」, the polite past 「叫びました」, and a slightly more descriptive/literary
      phrasing 「声を 上げた」 for 'raised her voice' while still using 「声の限り」.
  - english: As long as the law permits, we will proceed with the project.
    japanese:
      - '{法律 が 許す 限り}、この プロジェクト を 進め ます。'

          being continuously met for the action to proceed.
    scene: A legal team discussing the feasibility of a new business venture.
    register: bijinesu nihongo (business)
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「法律が許す限り」 means 'as long as the law permits.' The first variation is polite business Japanese.
      The second uses the more formal 「法律 の 許す 限り」 (treating 法律の許す as a noun phrase), and employs very
      formal business terms 「本 プロジェクト」 and 「推進 いたします」. The third variation 「この 計画 を 進めて いきます」 uses 「計画」
      (plan) instead of 「プロジェクト」 and implies a continuous progression with 「進めていきます」.
  - english: I will help you with all my heart.
    japanese:
      - '{心 の 限り}、あなた を 助けよう。'
      - '{心 の 限り}、あなた を お 手伝い し ましょう。'
      - '{心 の 限り} を 尽くし て、あなた を 助け ます。'

    setting: supportive
    nuance: 「心の限り」 is a heartfelt expression, meaning "to the full extent of one's heart" or "with all
      one's sincerity." This is often used to express strong emotional commitment, using the noun 「心」
      (heart/mind) to define the limit. The variations include the plain volitional 「助けよう」 (let's help/I
      will help), the polite volitional with humble expression 「お手伝い しましょう」, and a more definite and emphasized
      polite statement 「心の限り を 尽くして、あなた を 助けます」, which means 'I will do my utmost best with all my heart
      to help you.'
post_example_writeup: These examples illustrate how 「〜限り」 precisely defines the scope of an action or
  state, whether it's the boundary of one's knowledge, the full extent of one's ability, or a continuous
  condition that must be met. Common idiomatic uses include phrases like 「知る限り」 (as far as one knows),
  「力の限り」 (to the best of one's ability), and 「命ある限り」 (as long as one is alive), all emphasizing a clear
  limit or condition.
