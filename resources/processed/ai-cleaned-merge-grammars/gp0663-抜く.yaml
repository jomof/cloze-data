    "etymology": "The verb 「抜(ぬ)く」 literally means \"to extract,\" \"to pull out,\" or \"to remove.\" When used as a suffix to another verb, it carries the nuance of extracting the full potential or completing something thoroughly, often implying overcoming difficulties to reach the end.",
    "writeup": "When connected to the ます-stem of another verb, the う-Verb 「抜く」 'to extract' is often used to indicate that something has happened \"completely.\" This \"extract\" nuance frequently indicates that beyond completion, something has been \"overcome,\" or \"seen through to the bitter end.\" The literal meaning of 「抜く」 can be thought of as being quite close to the English expression \"to pull through,\" for example, \"despite difficulties, I pulled through in the end.\" 「抜く」 may also be used in situations where an action is done to a very deep or substantial degree. This nuance is closer to \"thoroughly\" or simply \"deeply.\" This meaning tends to appear with verbs that don't have an obvious end, like 「知る」 'to know', in which case it means 「知り抜く」 'to know every single little detail'. On most occasions, 「ぬく」 will be used when there is some hardship or adversity associated with the action. Also, unlike 「切る」, 「ぬく」 will almost always be used in relation to human actions. 「切る」, on the other hand, may be used in relation to either human actions or other events equally as naturally.",
