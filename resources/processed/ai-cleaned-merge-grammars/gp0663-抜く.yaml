    "etymology": "The verb 「抜く (nuku)」 originally means \"to extract\" or \"to pull out.\" When used as a compound verb, it retains the nuance of completely removing or going through something, implying a thoroughness or overcoming of obstacles.",
    "writeup": "When connected to the ます-stem of another verb, the う-Verb 「抜く」, meaning \"to extract,\" is often used to indicate that something has happened \"completely.\" This \"extract\" nuance frequently implies that beyond completion, something has been \"overcome\" or \"seen through to the bitter end.\"\n\nThe literal meaning of 「抜く」 can be thought of as being quite close to the English expression \"to pull through,\" for example, \"despite difficulties, I pulled through in the end.\" Alternatively, 「抜く」 may be used in situations where something is done to a very deep or substantial degree. This nuance is closer to \"thoroughly\" or simply \"deeply.\" This meaning tends to appear with verbs that don't have an obvious end, like 知る 'to know'. Despite this nuance seeming different, the verb with 「抜く」 attached to it in these types of sentences is usually considered to have already been done to a 'finished' degree, where there is nothing left beyond that point. With the example of 'to know', it would mean 'to know every single little detail'.\n\n*   On most occasions, 「ぬく」 will be used when there is some hardship or adversity associated with the action.\n*   Unlike 「切る」, 「ぬく」 will almost always be used in relation to human actions. 「切る」, on the other hand, may be used in relation to either human actions or other events equally as naturally.",
