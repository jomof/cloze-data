    "etymology": "「になる」 comes from the verb 「なる」 (naru), meaning \"to become.\" When attached to nouns and na-adjectives with 「に」, it indicates a change of state into that noun or adjective. For i-adjectives, the 「い」 is dropped and 「くなる」 is added to the stem.",
    "writeup": "「になる」 (with nouns and な-adjectives) and 「くなる」 (with い-adjectives) express a change in state, meaning \"to become.\" The verb 「なる」 can be conjugated to indicate different tenses (past, present, future) or to express negativity. For example, you can say something *will become*, *is becoming*, or *has become*. Even negative forms can be used to show something *will not become (A)*.\n\nFor い-adjectives, the final 「い」 is dropped, and 「くなる」 is added to the stem.\n\nImportant exception: The adjective 「いい」 (\"good\") conjugates to 「よくなる」, not 「いくなる」.",
