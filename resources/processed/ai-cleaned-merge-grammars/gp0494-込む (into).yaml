    "etymology": "The verb 「込む」 originally meant \"to be crowded\" or \"to be packed.\" It combines the verb 「入る」 (to enter) with the nuance of being densely filled. When used as a suffix, it retains this sense of entering completely or deeply into a state or action.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「込む」 (komu) is often used as a suffix to other verbs, indicating an action is performed 'into' something. It conveys the sense of something being put into something else, often implying a complete or forceful entry. The う-Verb 「込む」 'to jam into' is frequently used as a suffix to convey several different meanings. The primary meanings are as follows: \n\n*   (A)込む - To enter completely into doing (A), or the state of being in (A).\n*   (A)込む - To enter a state of doing (A) that will not be considered complete until 'success'.\n*   (A)込む - To enter a state of doing (A) that cannot be escaped from.\n\nIn this lesson, we will exclusively focus on the first meaning, which is usually translated as 'to put into (A)', or 'to go into (A)'. This form will be attached to the conjunctive form of other verbs. Despite the multiple meanings, 「込む」 can almost always be thought of as 'jamming (B) into (A)'. This means that whatever the (A) action is, will be something that is not easily entered, but also not easily escaped from.",
