    "etymology": "The verb 「込む」 originally meant \"to be crowded\" or \"to be packed.\" It combines the verb 「入る」 (to enter) with the nuance of being densely filled. When used as a suffix, it retains this sense of entering completely or deeply into a state or action.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「込む」 (komu) is primarily used as a suffix attached to the masu-stem of other verbs. It indicates that an action is performed 'into' something, conveying a sense of complete or thorough entry. This can be interpreted both literally, as physically entering a space, or figuratively, as delving deeply into a state or activity. \n\nThis grammar point focuses on the core meaning of 'to put into (A)' or 'to go into (A)', where 'A' is the action indicated by the preceding verb. The nuance often implies that the entry is not necessarily easy, and once an action or state is 'entered into' with 「込む」, it signifies a deep or committed engagement. Think of it as 'jamming (B) into (A)', suggesting a full and often irreversible integration.",
