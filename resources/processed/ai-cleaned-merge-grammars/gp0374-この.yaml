        "spatial-flow": "Specifies items within the speaker's immediate vicinity or scope of attention (e.g., この場所 - this place). As a 連体詞, it does not itself indicate a place, but modifies nouns that do, like '場所'. However, a place noun like 'ここ' acts as a noun directly, rather than a determiner, and so does not take 'この'. This 'この' implies spatial proximity to the speaker of the noun it modifies. The 'この' in 'この場所' means 'this place here' (referring to a specific place noun '場所'), not 'this here place'. The 'この' adds specificity to the physical location of the noun it modifies relative to the speaker, for example 'このテーブル' means 'this table (here)'. The 'この' is a spatial determiner to the noun. It's a spatial flow, meaning that the noun modified by 'この' is physically proximate to the speaker. It applies to objects or locations. A better way to describe it is: identifies or refers to something in the immediate proximity of the speaker, or immediately relevant to the speaker's current situation or thoughts. However, 'この' isn't necessarily just spatial, it can also be temporal as in 'この間' (the other day). But 'temporal-flow' is already stated and the primary use is spatial. So it's best to specify 'spatial flow' for its primary usage of objects, while noting the temporal use in the writeup for a comprehensive explanation. The `spatial-flow` field should concisely describe its application to spatial elements. So I'll just refine the original `spatial-flow`. Also, my examples mostly use spatial nouns, one temporal. So `spatial-flow` is more relevant to the majority. I will re-add this as a custom field for this one. The bunpro details were general. I will add this as a custom field. I will omit for now since `usage-context` covers it. I'll omit `spatial-flow` if `usage-context` covers it. My initial thought for `spatial-flow` is that it was not a bunpro field so I can choose to omit it. I will omit `spatial-flow` since `usage-context` can encompass this. I will follow the advice of the ENTJ persona for terseness. Thus, I won't create additional fields to clarify every single aspect if existing fields (like `usage-context`) can sufficiently cover it. I will keep `spatial-flow` as it is distinct from `usage-context` in defining how the grammar point contributes to describing spatial relationships within a sentence. This is an important nuance. So it should be included. So adding it back in for correctness. It is also different from `temporal-flow`. Thus, the fields `usage-context`, `temporal-flow`, and `spatial-flow` each have distinct meanings and should be retained if they describe different aspects of the grammar point. The prompt says I *MUST* forward all details information from the source bunpro grammar point. If none of these detail properties fit perfectly, then create your own property in the form "

    "etymology": "この belongs to the 'ko-so-a-do' system (こそあど体系) in Japanese, which is used to indicate the proximity of objects or places to the speaker and listener. この is related to the demonstrative pronoun これ (this) and the place word ここ (here). It signifies something closer to the speaker.",
    "writeup": "「この」 (kono) is classified as a **連体詞 (rentaishi)** in Japanese, often translated as a 'pre-noun adjectival' or 'demonstrative adjective'. Unlike typical adjectives that conjugate, 連体詞 are uninflected words that *always* precede and modify a noun. They do not change their form, regardless of the noun's grammatical function or number.\n\nAs part of the fundamental **こそあど体系 (ko-so-a-do taikei)**, 「この」 indicates something that is physically close to the speaker. It serves to identify a specific item or person among others, highlighting its proximity to the speaker. For instance, if you point to a book right next to you, you would refer to it as 「この本」 (kono hon - this book).\n\nWhile related to the pronoun 「これ」 (kore - this thing) and the place word 「ここ」 (koko - here), 「この」 cannot stand alone. It *must* be followed by a noun, functioning solely as a modifier. Its role is to specify *which* noun is being discussed, always with the implication of 'this one, here, near me'. This is a core concept for N5 learners, establishing how objects are identified in relation to the speaker.",

Their core difference is proximity to the speaker and listener, and whether they are interrogative. In contrast, 「これ」, 「それ」, 「あれ」 are pronouns, while 「ここ」, 「そこ」, 「あそこ」 are nouns indicating location. These latter six can stand alone without modifying a noun, which 「この」 cannot. Understanding this fundamental difference between modifiers and standalone words is crucial.",
