    "etymology": "「この」 is derived from the demonstrative pronoun 「これ」 (kore), meaning \"this\". Over time, 「この」 evolved to function as a pre-noun adjectival, modifying nouns to indicate proximity to the speaker.",
    "writeup": "「この」is classified as a pre-noun adjectival (連体詞) in Japanese. These words do not conjugate and always appear in the same form. 「この」 is related to words like 「これ」 and 「ここ」, and it's used to identify something near the speaker. As a pre-noun adjectival, 「この」 always precedes a noun and describes it.",
