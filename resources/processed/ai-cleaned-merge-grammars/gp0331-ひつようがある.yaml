    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ひつようがある」 combines 「必要 (hitsuyou)」, meaning \"necessary\" or \"need\", with the verb 「ある (aru)」, meaning \"to exist\" or \"to be\". Thus, literally, it means \"necessity exists\". The particle 「が (ga)」 marks 「必要」 as the subject.",
    "writeup": "Like 「が必要」, 「ひつようがある」 is an expression used to highlight the 'need' or 'necessity' of something. The primary difference is that 「ひつようがある」 highlights the need to 'do (A)', and will therefore be used with verbs (without the need for nominalization).\n\nTo use 「ひつようがある」, simply attach it after the plain form of the verb that describes the action you want to highlight the 'need' for. For example, 「食べるひつようがある」 (taberu hitsuyou ga aru) means \"it is necessary to eat.\"\n\nThis construction is derived from the combination of a verb (in plain form), 「必要」 (a noun meaning 'need'), the case marking particle 「が」, and the う-Verb 「ある」. In this way, it literally means \"the need of doing (A) exists.\"\n\nNaturally, this grammar pattern may also be used negatively, to highlight that there is 'no need to do (A)', or that 'doing (A) is not necessary'. For example, 「食べるひつようがない」 (taberu hitsuyou ga nai) means \"there is no need to eat.\"",

            "nuance": "While 「ひつようがある」 focuses on the *action* that needs to be done, 「がひつよう」 simply states that something is needed without specifying an action. For example, 「ビタミンがひつよう」 (bitamin ga hitsuyou) means \"vitamins are needed.\""
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "Both expressions convey the idea of necessity, but their usage differs. 「ひつようがある」 specifically refers to the necessity of performing an *action* (a verb). In contrast, 「がひつよう」 indicates that a *thing* (a noun) is necessary or required. Remember this distinction to choose the appropriate phrase for what you want to express.",
