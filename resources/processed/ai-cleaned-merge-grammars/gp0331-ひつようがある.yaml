    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ひつようがある」 combines 「必要 (hitsuyou)」, meaning \"necessary\" or \"need\", with the verb 「ある (aru)」, meaning \"to exist\" or \"to be\". Thus, literally, it means \"necessity exists\". The particle 「が (ga)」 marks 「必要」 as the subject.",
    "writeup": "「必要がある (hitsuyou ga aru)」 is used to express the **necessity** or need to do something. It highlights that something *must* be done. It's similar to 「必要 (hitsuyou)」 itself, but this grammar point emphasizes the existence of a need for a specific action.\n\n*   To form it, attach 「必要がある」 to the plain form of a verb. For example, 「食べる必要がある (taberu hitsuyou ga aru)」 means \"it is necessary to eat.\"\n*   The negative forms, 「必要がない (hitsuyou ga nai)」 or 「必要がありません (hitsuyou ga arimasen)」, indicate that something is *not* necessary.",
