    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ひつようがある」 combines 「必要 (hitsuyou)」, meaning \"necessary\" or \"need\", with the verb 「ある (aru)」, meaning \"to exist\" or \"to be\". Thus, literally, it means \"necessity exists\". The particle 「が (ga)」 marks 「必要」 as the subject.",
    "writeup": "Like 「が必要」, 「必要がある」 is an expression used to highlight the 'need' or 'necessity' of something. The primary difference is that 「必要がある」 highlights the need to 'do (A)', and will therefore be used with verbs (without the need for nominalization).\n\nTo use 「必要がある」, simply attach it after the plain form of the verb that describes the action you want to highlight the 'need' for. For example, 「食べる必要がある」 (taberu hitsuyou ga aru) means \"it is necessary to eat.\"\n\nThis construction is derived from the combination of a verb (in plain form), 「必要」 (a noun meaning 'need'), the case marking particle 「が」, and the う-Verb 「ある」. In this way, it literally means \"the need of doing (A) exists.\"\n\nNaturally, this grammar pattern may also be used negatively, to highlight that there is 'no need to do (A)', or that 'doing (A) is not necessary'. For example, 「食べる必要がない」 (taberu hitsuyou ga nai) means \"there is no need to eat.\"",
