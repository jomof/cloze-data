  Verb (た形) + 末に / の末 / 末の: Indicates an outcome after a long process or action.

jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  usage-context: Used to describe an outcome or conclusion reached after a long or complicated process,
    often involving deliberation, effort, or struggle.
  function: Expresses the culmination or eventual result of preceding actions or states.
  nuance: Implies that the final outcome or conclusion is reached after a significant period of time,
    multiple attempts, careful consideration, or enduring hardship. It emphasizes the 'aftermath' or 'end
    result' of a process.
  grammatical-role: Functions adverbially when followed by に, or attributively when followed by の, modifying
    a noun.
etymology: The word 「末 (すえ)」 originally refers to the 'end' or 'tip' of something, like a branch or a
  period of time. Its usage in this grammar point extends this core meaning to signify the 'end result'
  or 'culmination' of a process or series of events. It emphasizes that the outcome occurs after a certain
  progression or effort, linking the physical 'end' to a metaphorical 'conclusion'.
writeup: |-
  This grammar point, 「〜た末・〜の末・〜末に」, is used to indicate that a particular outcome or conclusion was reached **after** a long process, a series of actions, or a period of deliberation. The phrase emphasizes the culmination of these preceding events. While it can be used for both positive and negative results, it often carries a nuance of something finally being decided or concluded after much effort, struggle, or consideration.

  The most common patterns are:
  -   **Verb (た形) + 末に**: This form is used when the preceding verb describes an action or process that has been completed or carried out over a period. For example, 「考えた末に」 (after much thought) or 「話し合った末に」 (after discussing thoroughly).
  -   **Noun + の末に**: This pattern is typically used with nouns that imply a process, struggle, or deliberation, such as 「議論の末に」 (at the end of the discussion) or 「苦労の末に」 (after much hardship).
  -   **末に / 末の**: These can function somewhat adverbially or attributively, respectively, highlighting the "eventual outcome."

  It is important to note that 「〜末に」 implies a finality or definitive conclusion that is reached *because* of the preceding process. It’s not just about temporal sequence, but about cause and effect where the preceding actions lead to the ultimate result.

  - term: Verb[て]から
    meaning: after; since
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜てから」 simply indicates a sequential action (A happens, then B). It does not carry the nuance
      of a long process or deliberation leading to a final conclusion, unlike 「〜末に」. It's a neutral temporal
      connector.
    grammar_point: てから (after and since)
  - term: Verb[た]結果
    meaning: as a result of; consequently
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜た結果」 focuses on the direct outcome or consequence of an action or event. While it indicates
      a result, it doesn't necessarily imply the extended process or careful deliberation that 「〜の末に」
      does. It's more about the immediate or logical consequence.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-た・Nounの]結果 (as a result of)'
  - term: Verb[て]を経て
    meaning: after undergoing; having experienced
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜を経て」 suggests passing through a formal stage, a significant period, or undergoing a specific
      experience or procedure. It implies a journey or a formal process rather than the internal deliberation
      or varied efforts often associated with 「〜末に」. It's frequently used in more formal or official contexts.
    grammar_point: を経て (after process or experience)
post_false_friends_writeup: While all these expressions indicate a sequence or consequence, 「〜末に」 distinctively
  emphasizes that the final outcome is the culmination of a preceding, often prolonged, process of thought,
  effort, or events. Unlike the more neutral temporal marker 「〜てから」 or the direct cause-and-effect of
  「〜た結果」, 「〜末に」 highlights the "end of the road" after a journey, sometimes a difficult one. 「〜を経て」 is
  similar in implying a process, but often refers to more formal or distinct stages of passage rather
  than the internal or varied efforts implied by 「〜末に」.

        english: After thinking for a long time, I decided to buy the house.
        hint: 「〜後で」 is a general temporal marker that indicates a simple sequence. It lacks the nuance
          of a prolonged process or deliberation that leads to a final outcome, which 「〜末に」 conveys. We're
          looking for an expression that emphasizes the culmination of thought.
    scene: A person is reflecting on a significant purchase decision.
    register: formal
    setting: serious

          culmination of the discussion.
    scene: A team or group is trying to resolve a conflict.

          success after effort. We're looking for that sense of 'after much effort, finally'.

          or *final result* of repeated attempts, often implying a sense of resignation after a process.
          We're looking for the sense of an 'eventual outcome after repeated actions'.

          outcome. We're emphasizing the thoroughness of the discussion.
    scene: A project team meeting where a difficult decision needs to be made.
    register: formal

  contexts, from personal decisions to formal processes. Its core meaning consistently conveys an outcome
  achieved after a preceding series of actions or a period of contemplation. Pay attention to the nuanced
  difference between 「末に」 and other similar expressions like 「てから」, 「結果」, or 「経て」, as 「末に」 often emphasizes
