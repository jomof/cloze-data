    "etymology": "です originates from the polite auxiliary verb ます (masu) used with verbs. Over time, ます evolved to also function as a copula, particularly in polite speech. です can thus be seen as a derivative of ます, adapted for use with nouns and adjectives.",
    "writeup": "です is an auxiliary verb indicating determination or assertion. It states that something \"is\" a certain way. It is the polite equivalent of だ. Although their roles are similar, both だ and です are standalone structures. です connects to words in the same way as だ but is also regularly attached to the end of い-Adjectives. While attaching です to い-Adjectives is common in spoken language, some consider it less appropriate in formal writing.",
