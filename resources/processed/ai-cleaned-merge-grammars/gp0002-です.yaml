    "etymology": "The origin of 「です」, widely used as a polite auxiliary verb, is a subject of debate. The most prominent theory suggests it evolved from 「であります」, which is a combination of the particle 「で」 and the polite form of the verb 「ある」 (to be), which is 「あります」. It is thought that this 「であります」 was contracted to become the modern 「です」.",
    "writeup": "「です」 serves as an auxiliary verb, indicating assertion or determination, essentially meaning 'to be' or 'it is'. It is the polite counterpart to 「だ」. While their functions are similar, 「です」 and 「だ」 are distinct grammatical structures.\n\n「です」 connects to nouns and な-adjectives in the same manner as 「だ」. However, it is also frequently attached to the end of い-adjectives. This usage with い-adjectives, while common in everyday spoken Japanese and casual communication like texting, is sometimes considered grammatically incorrect in formal written Japanese.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\nAlthough attaching 「です」 to い-adjectives is widely accepted in colloquial Japanese, it is advisable to avoid it in official documents or highly rigid contexts. Nevertheless, in contemporary Japanese, this usage is gradually becoming more standard.",
