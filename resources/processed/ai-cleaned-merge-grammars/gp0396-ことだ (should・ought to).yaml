jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: semi-formal
  function: expresses advice, strong recommendation, or general truth
  nuance: Implies what *ought* to be done or what *is* the natural/expected course of action. It's often
    used when giving advice or making a general statement about what is typically the case. It has a prescriptive
    nuance, indicating a general principle or the natural course of action.
etymology: The phrase 「ことだ」 is formed by combining the nominalizer 「こと」 (meaning 'thing' or 'matter')
  with the copula 「だ」. This structure literally translates to 'it is the matter of...' or 'it is the thing
  of...', which then takes on the nuanced meaning of 'it is what should be done' or 'it is a general principle'.
  The nominalizer transforms the preceding verb phrase into a concept or abstract idea, making the statement
  a general truth or a universally applicable piece of advice, rather than a specific command or mere
  possibility. This construction emphasizes the inherent nature or logical necessity of an action.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「ことだ」 is used to express strong advice, recommendation, or to state a general truth about what should or ought to be done. It is often found in instructional contexts, wisdom, or when giving firm guidance.

  It attaches to the dictionary form of verbs for positive advice and to the negative plain form for negative advice. While it conveys a sense of obligation, it is typically understood as a suggestion based on general wisdom, natural course, or logical necessity, rather than a strict command or a moral imperative.

  This construction frames the advice as an undeniable truth or the most appropriate course of action, often implying that failure to follow it would be unwise or against the natural order of things. It is generally applicable and less about a specific duty imposed by external rules. It can also be used to express general observations about human nature or universal principles.

  - term: 〜べきだ
    meaning: should, ought to (stronger obligation)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ことだ」 expresses what is generally advisable or the natural thing to do, often like a piece
      of wisdom or principle. 「べきだ」 conveys a stronger sense of moral obligation or duty, indicating something
      that is ethically or socially expected.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[dictionary]べき・べきではない (should・should not)
  - term: 〜なければならない
    meaning: must do, have to (necessity)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ことだ」 gives advice based on what is good or natural. 「なければならない」 indicates a strong necessity
      or compulsion, often imposed by rules, laws, or unavoidable circumstances, with less room for personal
      choice.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:〜なければならない・なきゃ (must do・have to)
  - term: 〜ほうがいい
    meaning: it is better to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ことだ」 is a firm piece of advice or a statement of general truth, implying a strong recommendation.
      「ほうがいい」 is a softer suggestion, offering an opinion on what would be a preferable or more advantageous
      course of action, leaving more choice to the listener.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[た]ほうがいい (it is better to do)
  - term: 〜のだ・〜んだ
    meaning: explanatory (reason, explanation)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While both can add an explanatory tone, 「ことだ」 specifically conveys advice or states a general
      principle for action. 「のだ」 (or 「んだ」) simply adds an explanatory nuance to a statement, providing
      background or a reason, without necessarily being prescriptive.
    grammar_point: 〜のだ・〜んだ (explanatory)
post_false_friends_writeup: When differentiating between these similar expressions, consider the degree
  of obligation and the nuance of choice. 「ことだ」 offers strong, general advice or states a principle. 「べきだ」
  implies a duty. 「なければならない」 denotes a necessity with no other option. 「ほうがいい」 is a gentle suggestion,
  offering a better alternative. 「のだ」 is purely explanatory.
