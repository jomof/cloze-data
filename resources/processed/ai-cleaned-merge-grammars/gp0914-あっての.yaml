    "writeup": "「あっての」 is a grammar pattern used to emphasize that something (B) exists **only because of** something else (A). It expresses that (B) owes everything to (A), or that (B)'s existence is solely due to (A).  The structure is 「A あっての B」. 「あっての」 is a combination of the verb 「ある」 (to be) in its て-form, and the case-marking particle 「の」. It is typically used when (B) benefits positively from (A), implying gratitude or recognition.  The particle 「が」 between (A) and 「あっての」 is often omitted.",
    "etymology": "「あっての」 is derived from the verb 「ある」 (aru, to exist) in its te-form 「あって」, followed by the particle 「の」. This construction implies a state of being dependent on something else.",
