    "etymology": "あっての is derived from the verb ある (aru, to exist) in its te-form あって, followed by the particle の. This construction implies a state of being dependent on something else. Etymologically, it can be viewed as an evolution of the basic grammar structure 〜がある (to have/there is). The key distinction lies in の allowing the second noun (B) to be marked as possessing the first noun (A), while the te-form あって signals that further crucial information about this dependency will follow.",
    "writeup": "あっての is a grammar pattern emphasizing that something (B) exists **only because of** something else (A). It expresses that (B) owes everything to (A), or that (B)'s existence is solely due to (A). The structure is `[Noun A] あっての [Noun B]`. This expression combines the te-form of the verb ある (to exist), あって, and the particle の. It is typically used when [Noun B] positively benefits from [Noun A], implying gratitude or recognition. The particle が may appear between [Noun A] and あっての, but it is **usually omitted**. Furthermore, because the te-form indicates that more crucial information will follow, sentences using あっての are very often followed by structures like から or ので to explain the reason for the dependency.",
