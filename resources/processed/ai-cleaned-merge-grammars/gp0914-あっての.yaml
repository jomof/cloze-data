    "writeup": "`あっての` is a grammar pattern emphasizing that something (B) exists **only because of** something else (A). It expresses that (B) owes everything to (A), or that (B)'s existence is solely due to (A). The structure is `[Noun A] あっての [Noun B]`. This expression combines the `te`-form of the verb `ある` (to exist), `あって`, and the particle `の`. It is typically used when [Noun B] positively benefits from [Noun A], implying gratitude or recognition. The particle `が` may appear between [Noun A] and `あっての`, but it is **usually omitted**. Furthermore, because the `te`-form indicates that more crucial information will follow, sentences using `あっての` are very often followed by structures like `から` or `ので` to explain the reason for the dependency.",
    "etymology": "`あっての` is derived from the verb `ある` (aru, to exist) in its te-form `あって`, followed by the particle `の`. This construction implies a state of being dependent on something else. Etymologically, it can be viewed as an evolution of the basic grammar structure `〜がある` (to have/there is). The key distinction lies in `の` allowing the second noun (B) to be marked as possessing the first noun (A), while the `te`-form `あって` signals that further crucial information about this dependency will follow.",

The scene, depicting a female employee's respectful yet frustrated report to her male supervisor, highlights the fundamental, almost philosophical, dependence implied by `あっての`, rather than just a simple cause-and-effect. This specific phrasing also aligns with how female speakers might convey mild frustration in a formal setting."
