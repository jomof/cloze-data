    "etymology": "This grammar point comes from the て-form of the verb 「ある」(aru, to exist) followed by the particle 「の」(no). The て-form indicates a reason or cause, and the 「の」 nominalizes the preceding clause, allowing it to modify a noun.",
    "writeup": "「あっての」 is a pattern that emphasizes that (B) exists only because of (A). It can be translated as \"(B) owes everything to (A)\" or \"(B)'s existence is only due to (A).\" The structure combines the て-form of the verb 「ある」(aru, to be) with the case-marking particle 「の」(no). 「あっての」 is preceded and followed by nouns, where the first noun is (A) and the second noun is (B). This grammar point is primarily used when (B) benefits positively from (A), showing or implying gratitude. The particle 「が」(ga) may appear between the (A) noun and 「あっての」, but it's often omitted.\n\nConsider 「あっての」 as an evolution of 「がある」(ga aru, to have). 「の」 marks (B) as possessing (A), while the て-form indicates further explanation of its importance. Therefore, (B) is often followed by structures like 「から」(kara) or 「ので」(node).",
