jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  usage-context: Used to indicate the existence or location of living things, such as people and animals.
  counterpoint: The counterpart for inanimate objects and plants is 「ある」.
etymology: The verb 「いる」 originates from classical Japanese and has consistently served to express the
  existence or presence of animate beings. Historically, it contrasted with 「ある」, which denoted the existence
  of inanimate objects or locations. While 「ある」 could sometimes imply animate existence in older forms,
  「いる」 specifically evolved to emphasize the living, moving presence of individuals and animals, solidifying
  this semantic distinction in modern Japanese. The common construction often involves the particle が
  to mark the subject, hence がいる.
writeup: |-
  The verb 「いる」 is fundamental in Japanese for indicating the existence or location of animate objects, such as people and animals. This is a crucial distinction from 「ある」, which is used for inanimate objects, plants, and abstract concepts. For example, you would say 「人が{いる}」 (There is a person) but 「本が{ある}」 (There is a book).

  The polite form of 「いる」 is 「います」. While 「いる」 is classified as a る-verb (Ichidan verb), its conjugation pattern is straightforward, making it one of the first verbs learners encounter. The kanji form **居る** is commonly seen and should be recognized, though there is no difference in nuance between its kanji and hiragana forms; it is simply a matter of writer preference.

  In casual speech, the particle 「が」 (which marks the subject of existence) is often omitted, a common characteristic of natural, informal Japanese. 「いる」 is not only for simple existence but also to describe ongoing states or actions when combined with the て-form of other verbs (e.g., ている).
false_friends:
  - term: ある
    meaning: To exist (inanimate objects); to have
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「いる」, 「ある」 is used for the existence of inanimate objects, plants, and abstract concepts,
      not for animate beings.
    grammar_point: ある (to exist, inanimate・to have)
  - term: 住む
    meaning: To live, to reside
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「いる」 simply means "to be present" or "to exist" for animate things. 「住む」 specifically implies
      "to live" or "to reside" in a place over time, indicating a more permanent or established presence.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:住む (to live・reside)
  - term: 存在する
    meaning: To exist, to be present, to subsist
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「存在する」 is a more formal and academic term for general existence, applicable to both animate
      and inanimate objects, as well as abstract concepts. It lacks the animate/inanimate distinction
      specific to 「いる」, which is typically used for the everyday physical presence of animate beings.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:存在する (general existence)
post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  It is crucial to distinguish between 「いる」 and 「ある」. If you are referring to a living being such as a person or an animal, you must use 「いる」. Conversely, for inanimate objects, plants, or abstract concepts, 「ある」 is the correct choice. Confusing these two fundamental verbs will result in unnatural and incorrect Japanese. For instance, one would say 「猫 が {いる}」 (a cat is here) but 「本 が {ある}」 (there is a book).

  Furthermore, while 「住む」 (to live/reside) indicates presence, it implies a more permanent dwelling than simply being present, which is what 「いる」 conveys. 「存在する」 also means 'to exist,' but it is a more formal and academic term used for general existence, applicable to both animate and inanimate objects, as well as abstract concepts. Unlike 「いる」, which is typically used for the everyday physical presence of animate beings, 「存在する」 is reserved for broader or more abstract contexts, such as the existence of a theory or a species.

          - 教室 に 先生 は {い ます} か。
        english: As for the teacher, is he/she in the classroom?
        hint: Using 「は」 here would imply a contrast or a known topic, like 'As for the teacher, is he/she
          there?' or 'Is the teacher here (unlike someone else)?' The scene implies a simple inquiry about
          existence, making 「が」 more natural for introducing new information. We're looking for a simple
          inquiry about existence.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 教室 に 先生 が {いる} か。
        english: Is the teacher in the classroom (plain form)?
        hint: The academic setting and the question format to a peer or senior student usually call for
          polite language, guiding the use of 「います」 over the plain form 「いる」. We're looking for a polite
          inquiry.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 教室 に 先生 が {あり ます} か。
        english: Is the teacher in the classroom (used for inanimate objects)?

          - 教室 に 先生 が {住ん で い ます} か。
        english: Does the teacher live in the classroom?

          We're looking for whether someone is currently present.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 教室 に 先生 が {存在 し ます} か。
        english: Does the teacher exist in the classroom?
        hint: 存在 する is formal and abstract, not typically used for describing a teacher's presence. いる
          is used for the physical presence of animate beings in everyday conversation. We're looking
          for the teacher's physical presence.

    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「が」 emphasizes the grammatical subject, 「先生」 (teacher), in the specific location.
      The polite form 「います」 is standard for questions in an academic or formal context. The sentence-final
      「か」 marks it as a question.

        hint: The informal, affectionate tone when talking about one's pet to a friend suggests the plain

        english: My dog lives by my side.
        hint: 住む means to live or reside. While dogs "live," saying it "lives by your side" is unnatural
          when describing constant presence. We're looking for constant presence, not a place of residence.
      - competing_japanese:
          - うち の 犬 は いつ も 私 の そば に {存在 する}。
        english: My dog always exists by my side.

          proximity. We're looking for a natural expression of physical presence.

    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: Here, 「は」 marks 「うち の 犬」 (my dog) as the topic, indicating that the statement is about the
      dog's general characteristic. 「いる」 is used in its plain form, fitting the casual and intimate context
      between friends.

          「いません」 is crucial for showing respect to both the caller and President Tanaka. The plain form
          「いない」 would be impolite. We're looking for a polite, professional statement.

          - 田中 社長 は 現在、オフィス に {あり ませ ん}。
        english: President Tanaka is currently not in the office (used for inanimate objects).
        hint: 「ありません」 is for inanimate objects. Since President Tanaka is an animate being, 「いません」 is
          the correct negative form of 「います」. The example clarifies that we are talking about a person.
          We're looking for the negative existence of an animate being.

          at the office. We're looking for current absence, not residency.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 田中 社長 は 現在、オフィス に {存在 し ませ ん}。
        english: President Tanaka does not exist in the office currently.
        hint: 存在 する is too formal and strong for simply stating someone is not physically present. いません
          is the natural polite negative for animate physical presence. We're looking for current physical
          absence.

    setting: professional
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The negative polite form 「いません」 is used to formally state the non-existence of an animate
      subject. 「は」 marks the topic, and 「現在」 emphasizes the current status, which is important in business
      communication. This shows respect to the '社長' (president). In highly respectful contexts, such as
      speaking about a superior like 「社長」 to an external party, the honorific verb 「いらっしゃる」 (the respectful
      form of 「いる」) is used, as seen in 「いらっしゃい ませ ん」, further elevating the level of politeness.

    speaker_gender: male

        hint: Both 「～たら」 and 「～ば」 can express conditions. However, 「～たら」 often implies a more direct or
          immediate consequence or discovery. In a 'what if' scenario where the speaker is hoping for
          help, 「～たら」 fits better for a potential outcome, while 「～ば」 can be more general or logical.

        hint: While grammatically correct, separating the sentences breaks the smooth flow of describing

        hint: Using 「から」 implies a reason or cause (e.g., 'Because there's a cat, it's sleeping quietly').
          The te-form simply connects the two observations, implying simultaneity or a continuous state
          without a direct causal link. We're looking for a simple connection without implying causality.

        english: A cat is existing in the next room, sleeping quietly.

        hint: 「なかっ た」 is the negative past form of 「ある」, used for inanimate objects or abstract concepts.
          Since 「彼」 (he) is an animate being, 「いなかった」 is the correct form. We're looking for the negative
          past existence of an animate being.

        english: When I went to his house yesterday, he did not exist.
        hint: 「存在 し なかった」 is overly formal and implies a philosophical non-existence rather than simply
          not being physically present at a location. We're looking for the physical absence of a person.
    scene: A friend explains why they couldn't meet someone the previous day.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The plain negative past form 「いなかった」 is natural for a casual conversation between friends,
      directly stating a past absence. The use of 「は」 with 「彼」 emphasizes him as the topic of the statement
      regarding his absence.
  - english: I'm sorry, the person you are looking for was not in the meeting room.
    japanese:
      - 申し訳 ござい ませ ん。お 探し の 方 は 会議 室 に {い ませ ん でし た}。
      - お 探し の 方 は 会議 室 に は {いらっしゃい ませ ん でし た}。
      - すみ ませ ん、会議 室 に は、お 探し の 方 は {い ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: Apologies. The person searching for was meeting room in was not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 申し訳 ござい ませ ん。お 探し の 方 は 会議 室 に {い なかっ た} です。
        english: I'm sorry, the person you are looking for was not in the meeting room (less polite).
        hint: While 「いなかった です」 is grammatically understandable, 「いませんでした」 is the standard polite negative
          past form and is more appropriate for professional settings, especially when conveying information
          to a client or visitor. We're looking for a polite and formal statement.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 申し訳 ござい ませ ん。お 探し の 方 は 会議 室 に {あり ませ ん でし た}。
        english: I'm sorry, the person you are looking for was not in the meeting room (for inanimate
          objects).
        hint: 「ありませんでした」 is the negative past polite form of 「ある」, used for inanimate objects. Since the
          context refers to 「お 探し の 方」 (the person you are looking for), an animate being, 「いませんでした」 is
          correct. We're looking for the negative past existence of an animate being.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 申し訳 ござい ませ ん。お 探し の 方 は 会議 室 に {住ん で い ませ ん でし た}。
        english: I'm sorry, the person you are looking for wasn't living in the meeting room.
        hint: 住む means to live or reside. The statement is about the person's current presence in the
          room, not whether they permanently reside there. We're looking for immediate past presence.
    scene: A receptionist informs a visitor at a company that the person they are seeking is not available.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: negative past polite (～ませんでした)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The highly polite opening 「申し訳 ござい ませ ん」 and the use of the polite negative past form 「いませんでした」
      are standard in formal business settings. 「お 探し の 方」 is a polite way to refer to the person the
      visitor is looking for, without explicitly naming them. The use of 「は」 marks the person as the topic.
      For a higher level of respect, 「いらっしゃい ませ んでし た」 could be used.
  - english: If there's anyone who understands Japanese, please raise your hand.
    japanese:
      - 日本 語 が わかる 人 が {いれ ば}、手 を 挙げ て ください。
      - どなた か 日本 語 が わかる 方 が {いらっしゃれ ば}、手 を 挙げ て ください。
      - 日本 語 が わかる 方 が {いらっしゃれ ば}、挙手 お 願い し ます。
    english_literally: Japanese understands person if exists, hand please raise.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 日本 語 が わかる 人 が {い たら}、手 を 挙げ て ください。
        english: If there's anyone who understands Japanese, please raise your hand (conditional 'tara').
        hint: While both 「～たら」 and 「～ば」 can express conditions. However, 「～ば」 often suggests a more general
          or logical condition, making it suitable for a universal request or instruction. 「～たら」 can imply
          a more specific or sequential condition. We're looking for a general condition to be met for
          an instruction.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 日本 語 が わかる 人 が {あれ ば}、手 を 挙げ て ください。
        english: If there's a person who understands Japanese (for inanimate objects), please raise your
          hand.
        hint: 「あれ ば」 is the conditional form of 「ある」, used for inanimate objects. Since 「人」 (person) is
          an animate being, 「いれ ば」 is the correct form. We're looking for the conditional existence of
          an animate being.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 日本 語 が わかる 人 が {住ん で いれ ば}、手 を 挙げ て ください。
        english: If there's a person living here who understands Japanese, please raise your hand.
        hint: 住む means to live or reside. The request is for anyone present who understands Japanese,
          not specifically someone who lives there. We're looking for immediate presence, not residency.
    scene: A presenter or instructor addressing an audience or class.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: conditional (～ば)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 'The 「～ば」 conditional form 「いれば」 presents a general condition: "if such a person exists."
      This is common in instructions or requests where the existence of a particular type of person is
      the prerequisite for an action. The phrase 「手 を 挙げ て ください」 is a polite request. The alternative
      using 「いらっしゃれ ば」 demonstrates honorific usage for higher formality or respect.'
  - english: Let's always be together.
    japanese:
      - いつ も 一緒 に {い ましょう}。
      - これ から も ずっと 一緒 に {い ましょう}。
    english_literally: Always together let's be.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - いつ も 一緒 に {いよう}。
        english: Let's always be together (casual).
        hint: 「いよう」 is the plain volitional form, suitable for very close friends or family. We're looking
          for a slightly more polite tone.
      - competing_japanese:
          - いつ も 一緒 に {あり ましょう}。
        english: Let's always exist (inanimate) together.
        hint: 「ありましょう」 is the volitional of 「ある」, which is for inanimate objects. We're talking about
          people being together.
    scene: A couple expressing their devotion and commitment to each other.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: intimate
    conjugation: volitional polite (～ましょう)
    nuance: The polite volitional 「いましょう」 conveys a gentle invitation or proposal to continue being together.
      While intimate in context, the polite form adds a touch of respect or formality, often used between
      partners or close friends who still maintain a degree of politeness.
post_example_writeup: These examples demonstrate the versatile usage of 「いる」 to express the existence
  or location of animate objects across different levels of politeness, tenses, and grammatical connections.
  Understanding the distinction between 「いる」 for animate objects and 「ある」 for inanimate objects is fundamental
  to using this grammar point correctly. Practice using the various conjugations to internalize their
  meanings and appropriate usage.
