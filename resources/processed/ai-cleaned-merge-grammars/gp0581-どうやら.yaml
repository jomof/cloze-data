        "usage-context": "general use",
        "function": "expresses a strong inference or deduction, often based on circumstantial evidence or observation, conveying 'it seems that' or 'apparently'.",

        "grammatical-role": "adverb"
    },
    "etymology": "「どうやら」 originally comes from 「どう」 (how) + 「やら」, an archaic particle indicating uncertainty about a singular thing or a list. It's similar to adding \"or whatever\" or \"or some such\" in English to soften a statement, but for a whole statement. It implies the speaker is trying to figure out 'how' things are, and 'apparently' this is the conclusion.",
    "writeup": "「どうやら」 translates to \"apparently,\" \"it seems like,\" or \"it looks like.\" It is an adverb that expresses speculation and often appears at the beginning of a sentence, modifying the entire phrase. It strengthens the uncertainty of things the speaker is already unsure about, functioning similarly to saying \"in some way it seems like (A).\" It is frequently used in conjunction with other speculative expressions like 「ようだ」, 「そうだ」, and 「らしい」, adding a layer of personal inference or deduction to the statement. While 「どうやら」 can be used in both casual and polite contexts, its primary function is to indicate that the speaker is drawing a conclusion based on available, often circumstantial, evidence.",

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When distinguishing between {どうやら} and similar expressions like 「～ようだ」, 「～らしい」, and 「～そうだ」, consider the source of the conjecture. {どうやら} is best used when the speaker is drawing a conclusion through their own process of deduction, piecing together various bits of information or observations. It implies a sense of 'from what I can tell' or 'it appears to be the case.' In contrast, 「～ようだ」 is more about direct sensory impressions, 「～らしい」 is often about hearsay or typical characteristics, and 「～そうだ」 (looks like) is visual, while 「～そうだ」 (I hear that) is about direct reports. {どうやら} adds a nuance of the speaker's intellectual involvement in arriving at the conclusion.",
