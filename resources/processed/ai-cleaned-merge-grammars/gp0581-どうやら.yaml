    "etymology": "「どうやら」 originally comes from 「どう」 (how) + 「やら」, an archaic particle indicating uncertainty about a singular thing or a list. It's similar to adding \"or whatever\" or \"or some such\" in English to soften a statement.",
    "writeup": "「どうやら」 translates to \"apparently,\" \"it seems like,\" or \"it looks like.\" It is often used with other phrases of speculation such as 「ようだ」, 「そうだ」, and 「らしい」, to emphasize the speaker's uncertainty. It functions similarly to adding \"in some way it seems like...\" to a sentence. As an adverb, 「どうやら」 usually appears at the beginning of a sentence and modifies the entire phrase, increasing the sense of conjecture.",
