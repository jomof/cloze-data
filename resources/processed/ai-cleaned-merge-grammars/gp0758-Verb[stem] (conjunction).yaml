etymology: The ます-stem, also known as the continuative form (連用形 ren'yōkei), is one of the foundational
  inflectional forms of Japanese verbs and adjectives. Its origin lies in the classical Japanese language,
  where it served as a versatile connecting form. Historically, it was used to connect a verb to a following
  verb or auxiliary, or to nominalize a verb to function like a noun. This inherent ability to "continue"
  the action or state led to its widespread use for linking clauses concisely and forming compound expressions,
  a function that persists in modern Japanese.
writeup: |-
  The verb stem, or ます-stem (連用形 ren'yōkei), is a fundamental inflectional form of Japanese verbs. It is primarily used to connect verbs or clauses in a concise and often formal or literary manner, or to form compound verbs and nouns.

  When connecting multiple verbs, the ます-stem offers a more elegant and compact alternative to the て-form, particularly in written Japanese such as newspapers, academic texts, or official documents. It implies a strong, often sequential or closely related, connection between the actions. For example, rather than saying 「電車に乗って、会社へ行った」 (densha ni notte, kaisha e itta - I got on the train and went to the office), one might encounter 「電車に乗り、会社へ行った」 (densha ni nori, kaisha e itta). This usage emphasizes the flow of actions without explicitly stating the causal or temporal relationship as strongly as the て-form might.

  The verb stem is also crucial for forming compound verbs (e.g., 読み書き yomikaki - reading and writing) and combining a verb with an auxiliary verb to add nuance (e.g., 始めます hajime-masu - to begin, 続けます tsuzuke-masu - to continue). It can also function to nominalize verbs when combined with certain nouns, creating expressions like 「話し方」 (hanashi-kata - way of speaking) or 「動き出し」 (ugoki-dashi - start of movement).

  While the ます-stem can link actions, its nuance differs from the て-form. The て-form often implies a clearer temporal sequence, cause-and-effect, or means. The ます-stem, on the other hand, tends to present actions as a list or a series of closely related events, with a greater emphasis on brevity and stylistic elegance, especially in more formal or academic contexts.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[て]
    meaning: and then
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The て-form often implies a clearer temporal sequence, cause-and-effect, or means. The stem
      form is more concise and can be more formal, often used for listing actions without emphasizing
      causality as strongly. We're looking for a simple sequential connection with a concise flow.
    grammar_point: Verb[て] (and then)
  - term: ながら
    meaning: while doing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ながら explicitly indicates simultaneous actions. The stem form linking verbs usually suggests
      sequential or closely related actions, not necessarily simultaneous ones. We're looking for a sequence
      of actions.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]ながら・つつ (while doing)'
  - term: し〜し
    meaning: and; listing reasons
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: し...し connects clauses and lists reasons, often with a nuance of 'and what's more'. The stem
      form directly links verbs or clauses to show a flow of actions or states, not typically to list
      reasons. We're looking for a straightforward connection of events.
    grammar_point: し〜し (and; listing reasons)
  - term: つつ
    meaning: while doing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: つつ is a more formal or literary equivalent to ながら, indicating simultaneous actions. The stem
      form is for connecting sequential or closely related actions, not parallel ones. We're looking for
      a sequence of actions.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]ながら・つつ (while doing)'
post_false_friends_writeup: The verb stem's conjunctive use can be easily confused with other linking
  forms. While the て-form is a general connector for sequential actions or cause-and-effect, the stem
  form often conveys a more concise, sometimes formal or literary linking of actions without explicitly
  detailing their relationship. For concurrent actions, forms like ながら or つつ are used. When listing reasons
  or adding supplementary information, し...し is more appropriate. The choice depends on the desired nuance
  of formality, brevity, and the precise relationship between the linked elements.

        hint: The て-form implies a clearer temporal sequence or cause-and-effect, and is generally more
          conversational. We're looking for a more concise connection, often found in formal writing.

        hint: The て-form works, but the stem form often provides a more concise and formal connection
          between successive actions in a narrative, common in biographies or reports. We're looking for
          a formal summary of achievements.

  - english: Please make sure to check and confirm the details.

        english: Please check the details, and then definitely approve.
        hint: 〜てから emphasizes that the checking must be fully completed before approval. The stem form
          is used here for a more direct coupling of two necessary actions without emphasizing strict
          temporal separation. We're looking for a smooth connection between two tasks.
    scene: A manager giving instructions to a subordinate.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
post_example_writeup: The nuance of the verb stem as a conjunction is subtle but significant. It often
  signals a more formal or literary tone, especially when connecting independent clauses. While it indicates
  a sequence, it does so with a sense of flow rather than the explicit cause-and-effect or strict temporal
  progression sometimes conveyed by the て-form. Its conciseness makes it a powerful tool for sophisticated
  expression.
