    "etymology": "「こと (事)」originally referred to events, affairs, or matters. Over time, it evolved to also function as a nominalizer, allowing verbs and adjectives to be treated as nouns. This usage allows for abstract concepts and actions to be discussed as tangible 'things'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「こと」 is used to nominalize verbs, adjectives, and even entire clauses, effectively turning them into nouns. Think of it as creating a noun phrase that refers to the *act* of doing something or the *state* of being something. It's similar to using '-ing' in English (e.g., 'reading' instead of 'to read').\n\nTo use 「こと」, simply attach it to the plain form of a verb or い-adjective. For な-adjectives, you attach 「なこと」 or 「だったこと」. For nouns, you use 「であること」.\n\nWhen 「こと」 is used at the end of a short sentence, it can also function as a sentence-ending particle, often carrying the nuance of a rule or command. However, in this case, it's usually written in hiragana (こと) rather than kanji (事), although it originates from the same word. This usage does not involve nominalization but rather implies a directive or a reminder of a standard practice.",
