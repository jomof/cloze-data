        "nuance": "こと (事) tends to give an objective, matter-of-fact tone. It is often used for general truths, principles, facts, or abstract concepts. When used as a sentence-final particle, it conveys a strong sense of instruction or rule."
    },
    "etymology": "「こと (事)」originally referred to events, affairs, or matters. Over time, it evolved to also function as a nominalizer, allowing verbs and adjectives to be treated as nouns. This usage allows for abstract concepts and actions to be discussed as tangible 'things'. The distinction between its kanji form (事) and hiragana form (こと) for certain usages (like sentence-final particles for rules) has developed to differentiate its nuanced functions, though both stem from the same core concept of 'matter' or 'affair'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「こと」 is used to nominalize verbs, adjectives, and even entire clauses, effectively turning them into nouns. Think of it as creating a noun phrase that refers to the *act* of doing something or the *state* of being something. It's similar to using '-ing' in English (e.g., 'reading' instead of 'to read').\n\nTo use 「こと」, simply attach it to the plain form of a verb or い-adjective. For な-adjectives, you attach 「なこと」 for non-past forms or 「だったこと」 for past forms. For nouns, you use 「であること」.\n\nWhen 「こと」 is used at the end of a short sentence, especially in official notices or strong directives, it can also function as a sentence-ending particle, often carrying the nuance of a rule or command. In this specific usage, it is almost exclusively written in hiragana (こと) rather than kanji (事), although it originates from the same word. This particular function does not involve nominalization but rather implies a directive or a reminder of a standard practice or rule.",
