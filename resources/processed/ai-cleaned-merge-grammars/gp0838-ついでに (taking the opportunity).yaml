details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: Used to express doing something extra or secondary because the primary action presents
    a convenient opportunity.
  function: Connects two actions, where the second action is done opportunistically as a result of the
    first.
  nuance: Implies that the second action is not urgent but is done because the opportunity arises. It
    can be used for both one-off and regular occurrences, though it leans towards one-off in formal contexts.
  colocation: Often used with verbs of movement (e.g., 行く, 帰る) or actions that provide a natural segue
    (e.g., 買い物, 散歩).
  grammatical-role: Functions as an adverbial phrase, modifying the verb of the secondary action.
  logical-flow: Implies a cause-and-effect or opportunity-based relationship where the primary action
    facilitates the secondary action.
  temporal-flow: The secondary action occurs during or immediately after the primary action, leveraging
    the timing provided by the primary action.
  spatial-flow: Often involves actions that share a common location or path, making the secondary action
    spatially convenient.
etymology: The word 「ついで」 originally means "opportunity" or "chance". The particle 「に」 indicates purpose
  or direction. So, 「ついでに」 literally means "using the opportunity" or "taking advantage of the chance."
writeup: |-
  「ついでに」 expresses the idea of doing something extra or secondary because the primary action presents a convenient opportunity. It conveys a nuance similar to "while you're at it" or "on the occasion of." The root, 「ついで」, originally denotes "opportunity" or "precedence," implying that the initial action or state serves as the natural impetus for the subsequent one. The second action is therefore a convenient byproduct, not necessarily the primary objective.

  It is commonly used with verbs in plain forms (dictionary or past) and nouns, which are connected using the particle 「の」. However, as shown in the formation, more specialized uses exist with verb マス-stem and adjective stems, often in idiomatic expressions.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *   「ついでに」 implies that the first action is the instigator for the second. The second action is often not urgent but is done because the opportunity presents itself.
  *   While 「ついでに」 can sometimes describe regular occurrences, it is more frequently used for **one-off** or incidental actions, as opposed to habitually combined activities. However, it is not strictly limited to one-off actions.
  *   It implies that the second action is less urgent or planned, benefiting from the convenience provided by the first.
  *   Its register is standard, but it can be used in more formal or polite contexts, though less formal alternatives like 「ながら」 might be preferred for truly simultaneous actions.

  - term: 時に
    meaning: when, at the time of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「時に」 simply indicates *when* something happens, without the connotation of convenience or
      taking advantage of an opportunity. For example, 「学校 に 行く 時 に 友達 に 会っ た」 (When I went to school,
      I met a friend) states a simple temporal relationship, not an opportunistic one.
    grammar_point: とき (when)
  - term: ながら
    meaning: while
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ながら」 indicates doing two things simultaneously, whereas 「ついでに」 suggests doing one thing as
      a result of doing another, often for convenience. For example, 「テレビ を 見 ながら ご飯 を 食べる」 (I eat while
      watching TV) implies concurrent actions, not one action creating an opportunity for another.
    grammar_point: ながら (while doing)
  - term: の間に
    meaning: While, During, Between, Period
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「の 間 に」 emphasizes a duration during which something else happens, often implying a specific
      time frame or an event occurring within a period. 「ついでに」 focuses on the convenience or opportunity
      created by the initial action. For instance, 「先生 が い ない 間 に、こっそり ゲーム を し た」 (While the teacher was
      away, I secretly played games) describes an action within a period, not an opportunistic side task.
    grammar_point: の間に (within an interval)
  - term: うちに
    meaning: While, During
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「うち に」 often implies taking action *before* a condition changes or an opportunity passes,
      or doing something within a specific duration. While it can suggest utilizing an opportunity, 「ついでに」
      more strongly emphasizes the secondary action being a convenient addition to a primary one. For
      example, 「忘れ ない うち に メモ を 取ろう」 (Let's take notes before I forget) highlights urgency related to
      a changing condition.
    grammar_point: うちに (while・before change)
  - term: つつ
    meaning: While, And
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「つつ」 is more formal and indicates two actions happening concurrently or an action accompanying
      a state. It is primarily used for simultaneous actions or expressing a contradiction. It does not
      carry the nuance of convenience or seizing an opportunity that 「ついでに」 does. For example, 「後悔 し つつ
      も 前 に 進む」 (While regretting, I move forward) shows simultaneous or contradictory states.
    grammar_point: つつ (while; and)
  - term: 〜ところに・〜ところへ
    meaning: At the time, When, While, Timing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: These phrases indicate an opportune moment or a specific point in time when something occurs.
      While this can sometimes overlap with the idea of an opportunity, 「ついでに」 explicitly links the second
      action as a convenient byproduct of the first, rather than just happening *at* a certain point.
      For instance, 「考え て いる ところ に 電話 が かかっ て き た」 (Just when I was thinking, the phone rang) emphasizes
      the precise timing.
    grammar_point: ところに・ところへ (timing a new event)
  - term: ているあいだに
    meaning: While, During the time that ~
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「の 間 に」, this emphasizes an action occurring during a specific period. It is more
      about the duration of the primary action creating a window for the secondary action, without the
      strong emphasis on the secondary action being a convenient, opportunistic addition. For example,
      「彼 が 寝 て いる あいだ に、手紙 を 書い た」 (While he was sleeping, I wrote a letter) simply states what happened
      during a period.
    grammar_point: ているあいだに (while something is happening)
  - term: がけに
    meaning: On the way to, As you go
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「がけ に」 often describes an action that occurs *just as* one is about to do something or *at
      the very moment of* starting or ending an action, often spontaneously. 「ついでに」, conversely, focuses
      on the convenience of doing a secondary task *because* a primary task is already in progress, taking
      advantage of the established context.
    grammar_point: がけに (on the way)
  - term: にあたり・にあたって
    meaning: When, When doing something, On the occasion, At the time
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: These are more formal expressions, typically used for significant or special occasions, such
      as starting a new project or celebrating an event. They do not convey the casual convenience of
      performing a minor, opportunistic task that 「ついでに」 does. For example, 「開店 に あたり、挨拶 し まし た」 (On the
      occasion of opening the store, I gave a greeting) refers to a formal event.
    grammar_point: にあたり・にあたって (at the time of)
  - term: がてら
    meaning: On the occasion of, While … as well, While … (one is) at it, During, Along the way
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「がてら」 is generally more formal than 「ついでに」 and implies a more intentional combination of activities
      where both actions have a purpose, often a primary one and a secondary one pursued concurrently.
      「ついでに」 often suggests the second activity is a less important or primary purpose, often a mere convenience.
    grammar_point: がてら (on the occasion of)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「時 に」, 「ながら」, 「の 間 に」, 「うち に」, 「つつ」, 「ところ に・ところ へ」, 「て いる あいだ に」, 「がけ
  に」, 「に あたり・に あたっ て」, and 「がてら」 can express similar ideas to 「ついでに」, it's important to distinguish the
  nuances. 「ついでに」 emphasizes the convenience of doing something in addition to something else. In contrast,
  other expressions focus on simultaneity, duration, timing, formality, or a more intentional combination
  of activities.

      convenient opportunity for the invitation.

        english: While returning home, I will stop by the post office.
        hint: 「ながら」 implies doing two things at the same time, but 「帰り ついで に」 highlights the convenience
          of adding an errand to the established route. We're looking for an expression that emphasizes
          the opportunistic nature of the second task.
    scene: Someone planning their route after work.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: This example uses the ます-stem of a verb (帰り, from 帰ります) with 「ついでに」 to indicate an opportunistic
      action (stopping by the post office) taken on the occasion of the primary action (returning home).
      It's a common, slightly more compact way of expressing "while on the way back."
post_example_writeup: 「ついでに」 is a versatile phrase that can be used in various contexts to express the
  idea of doing something else conveniently. Remember that the first action provides the opportunity or
  reason for the second action.
