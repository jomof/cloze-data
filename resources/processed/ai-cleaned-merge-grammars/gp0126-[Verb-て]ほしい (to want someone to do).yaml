id: gp0126
meaning: to want someone to do something
pronunciation:
  katakana: テ ホシイ
  romaji: te hoshii
formation:
  Verb[て-form] + ほしい: Expresses the speaker's desire for another person to perform an action.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The component 「ほしい」 is derived from the adjective 「欲し」, meaning 'desired' or 'wanted,' often
  referring to objects. When combined with the て-form of a verb, it extends this meaning of 'wanting'
  to actions performed by others. This evolution allows the speaker to express a strong personal desire
  for an external event or action to occur, often for their benefit or satisfaction.
writeup: This grammar point allows you to express your desire for someone else to perform an action. It
  is formed by attaching 「ほしい」 to the て-form of a verb. While 「〜たい」 expresses the speaker's desire to
  do something themselves, 「〜てほしい」 expresses the speaker's desire for another person to do something.
  It implies a direct wish from the speaker. Because of this directness, it can sometimes sound demanding
  or blunt, especially if used in formal situations or with people of higher status without proper softening.
  Therefore, it's often used among family, friends, or with those of equal or lower status. To soften
  the expression and make it more polite, you can add 「のですが」 or 「いただきたいのですが」 after 「ほしい」, or use alternative
  indirect request forms. It's important to distinguish this from simply wanting an object. While 「〜がほしい」
  means "I want (an object)," 「〜てほしい」 means "I want (someone) to do (an action)." The subject of the action
  desired is usually the listener or a third party, and it is often omitted when clear from context.

  - term: Verb[て]くれる
    meaning: someone does (an action) for me/us
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜てくれる」 indicates that someone has done or is doing an action for the benefit of the speaker
      or their in-group, emphasizing the act itself. 「〜てほしい」 expresses the speaker's desire for that action
      to happen in the future.

  - term: '[Noun]が欲しい'
    meaning: to want (an object)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜がほしい」 is used for wanting nouns/objects, while 「〜てほしい」 is used for wanting someone to perform
      a verb/action.
    grammar_point: '[Noun]が欲しい (to want something)'
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the distinction between these expressions is crucial. 「〜たい」
  focuses on the speaker's own desires. 「〜てほしい」 shifts that desire to an action performed by someone else.
  「〜てくれる」 describes an action someone has already done or is doing for you. Finally, 「〜がほしい」 is for wanting
  objects. Pay close attention to the particles and the type of word (verb or noun) preceding 「ほしい」 or
  「たい」.

        english: Are you coming to the party next week?
        hint: 「〜に来る？」 is a direct question about attendance, not an expression of the speaker's desire

          to attend.
    scene: Inviting a friend to a party.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male

        hint: 「〜させたい」 implies actively making someone do something (causative desiderative), which is

          to voluntarily understand.

    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: female

          to recover.
    scene: Discussing current events with a group of friends.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 心配 する な。
        english: Don't worry! (direct command)
        hint: 「〜するな」 is a plain imperative (command) for prohibition, which is much stronger than expressing
          a desire for someone not to do something. We're looking for an expression of the speaker's desire
          for the listener not to worry.
    scene: Reassuring someone who is anxious.
    register: casual

    speaker_gender: male

        english: Stop this noise quickly! (command)

    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 息子 は もっと 勉強 す べき だ。
        english: My son should study harder.
        hint: 「〜べきだ」 expresses obligation or strong recommendation, whereas 「〜てほしい」 conveys a desire or
          wish. We're looking for an expression of parental desire, not an objective statement of what
          *should* be done.
    scene: A parent discussing their child's study habits with another parent.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male

      reason for the speaker's concern or desire. This highlights the personal nature of the wish.

    japanese:
      - 私 の 気持ち も {考え て ほしい}。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の 気持ち も 考えろ。
        english: Think about my feelings too! (command)
        hint: 「〜考えろ」 is a very strong, plain imperative, which would sound rude and aggressive in this
          context. We're looking for an expression of desire, not a command.
    scene: Expressing frustration in a personal relationship.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: This conveys a plea for empathy or consideration, often implying that the listener has not
      been considering the speaker's feelings.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, 「〜てほしい」 is a versatile expression of desire for others'
  actions. Its directness means careful consideration of context and politeness markers is often necessary,
  especially in formal or hierarchical interactions.
