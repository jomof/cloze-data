jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used when you want someone to perform an action for you. The person you want to do the
    action is marked with the 「に」 particle. Generally, it's considered impolite to use this grammar with
    someone of higher status.
  function: Expresses the speaker's desire for an action to be performed by someone else.
  nuance: Implies a subtle expectation or gentle request, often not suitable for direct commands or superiors.
etymology: The grammatical construction 「てほしい」 is formed by combining the te-form of a verb with the auxiliary
  adjective 「ほしい」. The te-form acts as a conjunctive particle, linking the verb to 「ほしい」. Historically,
  「ほしい」 comes from the classical Japanese word 「ほし」, meaning 'to want' or 'to desire', which could be
  used for both objects and actions. Over time, its use evolved, particularly in modern Japanese, to pair
  with the te-form of verbs specifically for expressing a desire for *another person's* action. This evolution
  highlights a linguistic mechanism of using adjectives to modify actions rather than just nouns, forming
  a core part of Japanese desiderative expressions.
writeup: The grammar point 「てほしい」 (te hoshii) is used to express the speaker's desire for **someone else**
  to perform an action. It is formed by taking a verb, changing it to its **te-form**, and then appending
  「ほしい」. While 「ほしい」 on its own means 'to want (an object)', when combined with the te-form of a verb,
  it transforms into an auxiliary adjective indicating a desire for an action. For example, if you want
  someone to help you, you would say 「手伝ってほしい」 (tetsudatte hoshii - literally, 'help-te want'). The level
  of politeness can be adjusted by adding 「です」 (desu) after 「ほしい」, making it 「てほしいです」 for polite contexts.
  However, the basic 「てほしい」 can be used in casual settings. **Important Considerations:** * **Who wants
  whom to do what?** It's crucial to understand the subject of the desire (the speaker) and the object
  of the action (the person performing the action). While it often translates as "I want *you* to do X,"
  it can also be used to report what a third person wants someone to do, such as 「彼が私にこれを読んでほしいと言っていた」
  (Kare ga watashi ni kore o yonde hoshii to itteita - He said he wants me to read this). The context,
  including particles (e.g., に for the recipient of the request) and surrounding phrases, helps clarify
  this. * **Nuance:** Depending on the context and intonation, 「てほしい」 can convey a range of meanings from
  a gentle request or wish to a stronger demand.
false_friends:
  - term: たい
    meaning: want to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「てほしい」, 「たい」 expresses the speaker's own desire to perform an action (e.g., 「食べたい」
      - I want to eat). It cannot be used to express a desire for someone else to do something.
    grammar_point: たい (want to do)
  - term: がほしい
    meaning: To want something, To be in need of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While sharing the core word 「ほしい」, 「がほしい」 is used to express a desire for a **thing** (a noun)
      rather than an action (e.g., 「新しい車がほしい」 - I want a new car). It cannot be directly followed by a
      verb in te-form.
    grammar_point: '[Noun]が欲しい (to want something)'
  - term: たがる
    meaning: To want to (Third person)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たがる」 is used to describe a third person's desire to do something, often based on observable
      behavior or inference (e.g., 「彼は遊びたがっている」 - He seems to want to play). It conveys an external observation
      of desire, whereas 「てほしい」 expresses the speaker's internal desire for someone else's action.
    grammar_point: '[i-Adj-stem]がる・[na-Adj]がる (to show signs of feeling)'
  - term: がる
    meaning: To show signs of feeling/wanting; to appear to be
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「がる」 is a suffix indicating that someone *appears* to feel or want something, often based
      on external signs. It can attach to various adjectives or the masu-stem of verbs (e.g., 「悲しがる」 -
      to act sad, 「痛がる」 - to complain of pain). While it relates to feelings, it focuses on their outward
      expression rather than a direct desire for an action.
    grammar_point: '[i-Adj-stem]がる・[na-Adj]がる (to show signs of feeling)'
  - term: ように〜てほしい
    meaning: Want ~ to ~ like ~, Want ~ to be able to ~, Want ~ to ~ in the way of ~
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「てほしい」, which directly expresses a desire for an action, 「ように〜てほしい」 expresses a desire
      for a state or condition to be reached, or for an action to be done in a specific manner or so that
      something becomes possible (e.g., 「病気が治るように安静にしてほしい」 - I want you to rest quietly so your illness
      heals). It implies an indirect or outcome-oriented desire.
    grammar_point: ように〜てほしい (want someone to act in a certain way)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「てほしい」 expresses the speaker's desire for another's action, other related
  expressions convey different nuances of wanting. 「たい」 is exclusively for the speaker's own desire to
  perform an action. 「がほしい」 is used for wanting objects. When observing another person's desire, 「たがる」
  or 「がる」 are used to describe what they *appear* to want or feel. Lastly, 「ように〜てほしい」 is for when the
  desire is for a certain outcome or state to be achieved through an action, rather than simply for the
  action itself.

      pragmatic functions, including expressing a personal feeling or providing an explanation, especially
      prevalent in female speech.

          - 子供 に もっと 自由 に 遊ん で {ほしい}。
        english: This means 'I want the children to play freely' as if they are actively choosing to play.
          「遊ば せ て ほしい」 (causative) means 'I want them to be allowed to play freely', implying a desire

    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The use of the causative form 「遊ば せ て 」 (from 遊ぶ, to play) combined with 「ほしい」 expresses a
      desire for the children to be *allowed* or *made* to play more freely, rather than simply wishing
      they would play more. This reflects the father's philosophical approach to parenting, giving them
      more autonomy. This is a common way for male speakers to express their thoughts on child-rearing
      in a casual context.
    etymology: The causative form 「～させる」 (or ～させる) attaches to verbs to indicate causing or allowing someone
      to do something. This construction with 「ほしい」 creates the meaning of wanting someone to cause/allow
      an action.

        english: I want to receive the favor of you becoming more smiley.

    register: casual
    setting: supportive
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female

    nuance: Using the plain form 「ほしい」 with a close friend indicates intimacy and directness. The optional

      female speakers when expressing personal feelings or gentle encouragement.

      in a gentle, conversational manner, suitable for sharing personal concerns with a friend. It avoids
      sounding accusatory towards the son.
  - english: I didn't want the secret to be exposed.
    japanese:
      - 秘密 が ばれ て {ほしく なかっ た}。
      - 秘密 が ばれ て {ほしく あり ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: The secret, I didn't want it to be exposed.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 秘密 を ばらし {たく なかっ た}。
        english: I didn't want to expose the secret.
        hint: 「ばらし たくなかった」 expresses the speaker's own negative desire to perform an action. We're looking
          for the speaker's desire for the secret *itself* not to be exposed.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 秘密 が ばれる {べき で は なかっ た}。
        english: The secret shouldn't have been exposed.
        hint: 「べきではなかった」 indicates a moral judgment or ideal that wasn't met. We're looking for a personal,
          retrospective desire that an event hadn't occurred.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 秘密 が ばれる の は {嫌 だっ た}。
        english: I hated the secret being exposed.
        hint: 「嫌だった」 expresses a strong dislike or aversion to something. While similar, 「ほしくなかった」 conveys
          a more direct, unfulfilled desire for a different outcome.
    scene: Someone reflecting on a past event where a secret they kept was revealed, expressing regret.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The use of the passive voice 「ばれ て 」 (to be exposed/found out) combined with the negative
      past plain 「ほしく なかった 」 expresses a strong retrospective desire that something *had not* happened.
      This phrase conveys personal regret or disappointment about an outcome that was not desired. It
      is a natural way for a female speaker to express such feelings in a casual, reflective context.
    etymology: 「ばれる」 is an informal verb meaning 'to be exposed' or 'to leak out', often used for secrets
      or hidden truths.
  - english: I didn't want to cause trouble for everyone by delaying the report.
    japanese:
      - 報告 が 遅れ て、皆 様 に ご 迷惑 を お かけ し て {ほしく あり ませ ん でし た}。
      - 報告 が 遅れ て、皆 様 に ご 迷惑 を お かけ し て {ほしく なかっ た} です。
    english_literally: Report delayed, everyone to trouble cause didn't want (polite).
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 報告 が 遅れ て、皆 様 に ご 迷惑 を お かけ する {べき で は あり ませ ん でし た}。
        english: I should not have caused trouble for everyone by delaying the report.
        hint: 「おかけするべきではありませんでした」 sounds more like an admission of a mistake or oversight. The scene implies
          an apology from a manager who didn't *intend* to cause trouble, which is better expressed by
          「てほしくありませんでした」 experimental sentence generation, not simple translation
      - competing_japanese:
          - 報告 が 遅れ て、皆 様 に ご 迷惑 を お かけ し {たく あり ませ ん でし た}。
        english: I didn't want to cause trouble for everyone by delaying the report (myself).
        hint: 「〜たくありませんでした」 expresses the speaker's own past desire *not* to perform an action. Here,
          the speaker is expressing a past desire that others not be troubled *by their actions*. We're
          looking for an expression of the speaker's past desire for their actions not to have caused
          a certain outcome for others experimental sentence generation, not simple translation
      - competing_japanese:
          - 報告 が 遅れ て、皆 様 に ご 迷惑 を お かけ する {つもり は あり ませ ん でし た}。
        english: I didn't intend to cause trouble for everyone by delaying the report.
        hint: 「〜するつもりはありませんでした」 expresses a lack of intention to do something. While related, 「てほしくありませんでした」
          expresses the speaker's personal wish that a negative outcome caused by them had not occurred.
          We're looking for an expression of the speaker's past desire for their actions not to have caused
          a certain outcome for others experimental sentence generation, not simple translation
    scene: A project manager is apologizing to stakeholders for a delayed report and the inconvenience
      it caused.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: apologetic
    conjugation: negative past polite (～ませんでした)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The phrase 「ご迷惑をおかけしてほしくありませんでした」 uses humble language 「おかけして」 and the polite past negative
      form of 「ほしい」 to express sincere regret for having caused trouble, emphasizing that it was not the
      speaker's desire
  - english: I wish you wouldn't worry so much about trivial things.
    japanese:
      - そんな 些細 な こと で あまり 心配 し て {ほしく ない} よ。
      - そんな 些細 な こと で あまり 心配 し て {欲しく ない} よ。
    english_literally: Such trivial things about too much worry do don't want (emphatic particle).
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - そんな 些細 な こと で 心配 する {な}。
        english: Don't worry about such trivial things!
        hint: 「するな」 is a direct and strong command. The scene implies a supportive and gentle approach,
          where expressing a personal desire is more appropriate than an outright prohibition. We're looking
          for an expression of the speaker's personal wish for the listener's action experimental sentence
          generation, not simple translation
      - competing_japanese:
          - そんな 些細 な こと で 心配 し {ない ほう が いい}。
        english: It's better not to worry so much about trivial things.
        hint: 「〜ないほうがいい」 offers advice or a suggestion. While well-intentioned, it lacks the direct expression
          of the speaker's personal desire that 「てほしくない」 conveys. We're looking for the speaker's wish
          for the listener's action experimental sentence generation, not simple translation
      - competing_japanese:
          - そんな 些細 な こと で 心配 し {たく ない}。
        english: I don't want to worry so much about trivial things.
        hint: 「〜たくない」 expresses the speaker's own desire not to perform an action. Here, the speaker wants
          *someone else* not to worry. We're looking for an expression of the speaker's desire for another
          person *not* to perform an action experimental sentence generation, not simple translation
    scene: A close friend tries to comfort another who is overly anxious about small matters.
    register: casual
    setting: supportive
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The 「よ」 particle at the end softens the negative desire, making it sound more like a gentle
      plea or a caring suggestion from a friend who wishes for the listener's peace of mind, rather than
      a strong admonition. The casual setting and relationship are key
  - english: I hope we can resolve this issue peacefully.
    japanese:
      - この 問題 が 平和 的 に 解決 さ れ て {ほしい} と 思い ます。
      - この 問題 が 平和 的 に 解決 さ れ て {欲しい} と 思い ます。
      - この 問題 が 平和 的 に 解決 さ れ て {ほしい} と 存じ ます。
    english_literally: This problem peacefully resolved be want think.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 問題 は 平和 的 に 解決 {す べき だ} と 思い ます。
        english: I think this issue should be resolved peacefully.
        hint: 「すべきだ」 implies obligation or necessity, focusing on what *must* be done. 「てほしい」 expresses
          a personal hope or desire for an outcome. We're looking for a statement of personal desire rather
          than a declaration of what is necessary experimental sentence generation, not simple translation
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 問題 が 平和 的 に 解決 さ れる {こと を 願っ て い ます}。
        english: I am wishing that this issue be resolved peacefully.
        hint: 「〜ことを願っています」 is a very formal and indirect way of expressing a wish for an outcome, often
          used for broad or general hopes. 「てほしい」 combined with 「と思います」 offers a slightly more direct,
          yet still polite, expression of personal desire. We're looking for a slightly more direct expression
          of the speaker's desire for the action to occur experimental sentence generation, not simple
          translation
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 問題 を 平和 的 に 解決 し {たい} と 思い ます。
        english: I want to resolve this issue peacefully (myself).
        hint: 「〜したい」 expresses the speaker's own desire to perform an action. Here, the speaker wants
          the *issue* to be resolved (by implication, by those involved), not necessarily by themselves
          alone. We're looking for an expression of a desire for a state or action to occur, not necessarily
          performed by the speaker experimental sentence generation, not simple translation
    scene: A diplomat or leader expresses a hopeful desire for a peaceful resolution during negotiations.
    register: formal
    setting: negotiating
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The use of the passive voice 「解決されて」 (to be resolved) implies that the action is not necessarily
      carried out by the speaker but by circumstances or involved parties. The added 「と思います」 softens the
      directness of 「ほしい」, making it a polite expression of hope for a collective outcome, suitable for
      a diplomatic context. It conveys a strong personal wish without directly commanding
post_example_writeup: The usage of 「てほしい」 allows for expressing a wide range of desires, from simple requests
  to regrets about past actions. Its flexibility makes it a key tool in conveying personal wishes regarding
  the actions of others. Pay close attention to the context and particles, particularly 「に」, to correctly
  identify who the request is directed towards. The addition of 「です」 (or lack thereof) clearly dictates
  the level of politeness.
