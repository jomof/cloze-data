        "function": "To make a polite or humble request.",
        "nuance": "This expression is more polite and formal than お〜ください or てください, often used in business, official settings, or when addressing superiors. It can sound stiff or sarcastic if used in casual contexts."
    },
    "etymology": "This expression is derived from the humble form of 「願う (negau)」, which means \"to request\" or \"to wish for.\" Adding 「お (o)」 or 「ご (go)」 before the verb stem makes the request more polite and humble, emphasizing respect towards the listener.",
    "writeup": "「お〜願う」 is a humble speech expression used to make polite requests. It functions similarly to 「お〜ください」 but conveys a higher level of politeness and deference. The usage typically follows a pattern where 「お」 is prefixed to verbs of Japanese origin, while 「ご」 is used for verbs formed from Sino-Japanese words (words derived from Chinese kanji).\n\nThe verb 「願う」 itself is a う-verb meaning \"to petition\" or \"to request.\" The literal interpretation of 「お〜願う」 is akin to \"I petition that you do (A) for me,\" which highlights the speaker's humble stance and the listener's role in fulfilling a request.\n\nDue to its inherent politeness, 「お〜願う」 almost always appears in its polite ます-form, 「お〜願います」. Another common variant is the potential form, 「お〜願えますか」, which softens the request further by framing it as a question of the listener's capability or willingness.\n\nFor words of Western origin (loanwords written in katakana), both 「お」 and 「ご」 are often omitted, and the loanword is simply followed by 「願う」 (e.g., 「サイン願います」).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n「お〜願う」 is significantly more formal than 「お〜ください」 or even the simple 「てください」. Consequently, its use is largely confined to highly formal circumstances, such as business correspondence, official announcements, public instructions, or requests made to superiors. If used in everyday, casual conversation, it can sound overly stiff, unnatural, or even sarcastic, depending on the tone and context. It is generally not used by younger people in casual settings.",
