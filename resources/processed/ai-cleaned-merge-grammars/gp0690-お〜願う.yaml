    "etymology": "This expression is derived from the humble form of 「願う (negau)」, which means \"to request\" or \"to wish for.\" Adding 「お (o)」 or 「ご (go)」 before the verb stem makes the request more polite.",
    "writeup": "「お〜願う」 is a humble speech expression used to make polite requests, similar to 「お〜ください」. As a polite form, 「お」 is generally used with words of Japanese origin, while 「ご」 is used with Sino-Japanese words (words derived from Chinese kanji). 「願う」 itself is a う-verb meaning \"to petition\" or \"to request.\" The literal translation is similar to saying \"I petition that you do (A) for me.\" Due to its politeness, 「お〜願う」 typically appears in its ます-form, 「お〜願います」.\n\nWords of Western origin, often katakana loanwords, may omit both 「お」 and 「ご」, simply using 「願う」 attached to the end. It's **important** to remember that 「お〜願う」 is even more polite than 「お〜ください」 or 「てください」. Therefore, it is mostly found in formal settings. Using it in everyday speech may sound sarcastic or overly formal.",
