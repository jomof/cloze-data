    "etymology": "This grammar point is formed by adding the honorific prefix お (or ご for words of Chinese origin) to the verb stem and then combining it with 願う (negau), which means \"to request\" or \"to wish for.\"",
    "writeup": "お〜願う is a humble speech expression in Japanese used for making requests in the same way as お〜ください \"please do (A)\". As with many other polite structures, the use of お will primarily appear with words of Japanese origin, while ご will be used for the majority of Chinese-origin kanji compounds.\n\n願う itself is a う-Verb meaning \"to petition\", and the literal translation is something like \"I petition that you do (A) for me,\" which sounds incredibly stiff in English, but gets the point across that someone is doing a favor for you.\n\nNaturally, due to being a polite sentence pattern, お〜願う will almost always appear in its ます-form, お〜願います.\n\nInterestingly, words of Western origin, such as katakana loanwords, will often omit both お and ご, appearing simply with 願う attached to the end.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nAs お〜願う is an even more polite way of saying お〜ください, or simply even just てください, it will rarely be used outside of formal circumstances, such as voice-overs giving instructions etc. If used in daily speech, it may come across as sarcasm.",
