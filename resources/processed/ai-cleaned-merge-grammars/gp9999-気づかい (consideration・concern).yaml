details:
  part-of-speech: noun
  register: formal
  function: Describes the act or state of being thoughtful or attentive to others' feelings and needs.
  nuance: Implies a subtle, often unstated, form of care or attentiveness. It can be positive, indicating
    thoughtfulness, but can also describe an excessive or even burdensome level of concern. It focuses
    on the internal feeling of concern and the actions taken due to it.
etymology: The word 「気づかい」 is formed from 「気」 (ki), meaning 'spirit, mind, feeling, attention,' and 「遣う」
  (tsukau), meaning 'to use, to spend.' Therefore, it literally means 'to use one's spirit or attention,'
  referring to the act of expending mental effort to consider others' feelings or situations. This emphasizes
  the internal, often delicate, effort involved in being thoughtful.
writeup: |-
  「気づかい」 refers to the act of showing consideration or concern for others, often by anticipating their needs or feelings and taking subtle actions to make them comfortable. It's about being thoughtful and attentive.

  While generally positive, implying kindness and politeness, 「気づかい」 can sometimes carry a nuance of excessive or unnecessary worry, especially when one is *overly* concerned about how others perceive them or about minor details. In such cases, it might lead to 「気疲れ」 (kizukare - mental fatigue from excessive concern) or feeling pressured.

  It is often used with the verb 「する」 (to do) as 「気づかいする」, meaning 'to be considerate' or 'to show concern'. It can also describe a trait, as in 「気づかいがある人」 (a considerate person) or 「気づかいのない人」 (an inconsiderate person). The focus is on the *mental effort* and the *sensitivity* involved in caring for others.

  - term: 気配り (kikubari)
    meaning: attentiveness, thoughtfulness
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「気配り」 emphasizes the active, outward manifestation of consideration, often in social or business
      situations. It's about performing specific actions to ensure everyone is comfortable or things run
      smoothly. While 「気づかい」 is the internal feeling of concern, 「気配り」 is the external action taken.

  - term: 心遣い (kokorozukai)
    meaning: heartfelt consideration, kindness
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「心遣い」 suggests a deeper, more emotional and heartfelt level of care or kindness. It often
      accompanies gestures like gifts or services, implying that the action comes from genuine affection
      or profound consideration. It feels more personal and warm than 「気づかい」.

  - term: 思いやり (omoiyari)
    meaning: empathy, compassion, thoughtfulness
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「思いやり」 is a broader term focusing on empathy—the ability to understand and share the feelings
      of another. It's about being sensitive to others' emotional states and acting out of compassion.
      While 「気づかい」 is about anticipating needs and acting carefully, 「思いやり」 is about connecting emotionally
      and acting from that understanding.

  - term: 気を使う (ki o tsukau)
    meaning: to be careful, to worry about, to pay attention
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「気を使う」 is the verb form that directly relates to 「気づかい」. While 「気づかい」 is the noun describing
      the 'act of showing consideration' or 'concern', 「気を使う」 is the action itself. For example, 「人に気を使う」
      means 'to be considerate of others' or 'to worry about what others think'.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:気を使う (to be considerate)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'To differentiate these terms, consider the focus: 「気づかい」 is primarily about
  the *internal state of concern* and the subtle actions that stem from it. 「気配り」 emphasizes the *outward,
  active steps* taken to ensure comfort or smooth operations. 「心遣い」 conveys a *deeper, more heartfelt
  emotional care*. 「思いやり」 is about *empathy and compassion*, acting from a place of shared feeling. Finally,
  「気を使う」 is the *verb form* of acting thoughtfully or worrying about others'' perceptions. While they
  share common ground in expressing attentiveness, their specific nuances highlight different facets of
  consideration.'

          rather than just worrying.
    scene: Reassuring someone who is being excessively worried or careful.

          highlights this specific type of care.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: Her compassion touched everyone's hearts.

        english: Sometimes, his nervousness can be a bit tiring.
        hint: 「神経質」 (shinkeishitsu) means 'nervous' or 'overly sensitive,' implying a person's own disposition
          to worry. 「気づかい」 refers to the *act* of showing concern towards others, even if excessive. We're

    scene: A private conversation between colleagues about a third person.
    register: casual
    setting: cautious

        english: Your worry, thank you. But please don't be concerned about me.
        hint: 「心配」 (shinpai) is simply 'worry' or 'concern.' While related, 「気づかい」 carries the nuance

          proactive care.
    scene: Someone politely declining help or excessive worry from another.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: apologetic
    nuance: 「お気づかい」 is the honorific prefix used to show respect for the other person's thoughtfulness.

      commonly used to gently refuse someone's over-attentiveness.

          - 彼 は 人 の 気持ち に 対し て あまり 思いやり が ない です ね。
        english: He doesn't have much compassion for others' feelings.
        hint: 「思いやり」 (omoiyari) means empathy or compassion. While often overlapping, 「気づかい」 implies specific
          actions taken out of consideration, whereas 「思いやり」 is more about the capacity for emotional
          understanding. We're highlighting a lack of active thoughtfulness.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 人 の 気持ち に 対し て とても 無 神経 です ね。
        english: He is very insensitive to other people's feelings.
        hint: 「無神経」 (mushinkei) means 'insensitive.' While it describes a similar outcome, 「気づかいがない」 specifically
          refers to the *absence of consideration*, rather than simply being blunt or tactless. We're
          focusing on the lack of thoughtful action.
    scene: A conversation lamenting someone's lack of empathy.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「気づかいがない」 means 'inconsiderate' or 'lacking thoughtfulness'. The phrase 「人 の 気持ち に 対して」 clarifies
      that the lack of consideration is specifically towards others' feelings. The 「ね」 at the end invites
      agreement from the listener.

          looking for the careful, delicate handling, not just general attention.
    scene: Explaining the requirements for a task that involves delicate handling.

          apologizing for insufficient consideration, not just general sloppiness.
    scene: Apologizing for a past oversight or inconsiderate action.

        hint: 「贈り物」 (okurimono) is a physical gift. 「気づかい」 refers to the intangible act of showing consideration
          or thoughtfulness. We're expressing appreciation for an act of care, not a material item.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あなた の 親切 は、本当 に 心 温まる もの でし た。
        english: Your kindness was truly a heartwarming thing.
        hint: 「親切」 (shinsetsu) is general kindness. While positive, 「気づかい」 implies a more subtle and specific
          form of attention to detail or consideration for feelings. We're appreciating their thoughtful
          effort.
    scene: Expressing deep appreciation for a personal act of thoughtfulness.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: intimate
    nuance: This sentence emphasizes the personal impact of the '気づかい' by using 「あなた から の」 (from you)
      and describing it as 「心温まる もの」 (a heartwarming thing), highlighting the emotional warmth received
      from the act of consideration.
post_example_writeup: These examples demonstrate the versatility of 「気づかい」, from expressing gratitude
  for thoughtfulness to describing someone's character or even the burden of excessive concern. Notice
  how it can be used with various particles and verbs to convey nuanced meanings related to consideration
  and attentiveness.
