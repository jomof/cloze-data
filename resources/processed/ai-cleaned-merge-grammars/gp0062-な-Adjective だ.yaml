    "etymology": "The term 「な-Adjective」 comes from the observation that these adjectives take the particle 「な」 when modifying a noun directly. 「だ」 is the plain form of the copula, indicating a statement of fact or assertion.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese grammar, 「な-Adjective だ」 is used to describe the predicate form of 「な」 adjectives. A predicate is a word that describes the topic/subject of a sentence. Think of a 「述語 (じゅつご)」, which literally means \"statement word\". As a predicate, 「な-Adjectives」 can appear by themselves (when the word they are describing does not need to be stated), or they may be used at the end of a sentence.\n\nIt's important to remember that all 「な-Adjectives」 can also function as nouns, and therefore tend to sound more like a noun than an adjective when used as a predicate. When there are no other words apart from the adjective itself, it comes across similarly to \"It's pretty\", or \"It's hated\", and similar expressions in English. We just have to guess what the 'it' is from context.\n\n**Important Consideration**\n\nUnlike 「い-Adjectives」, 「な-Adjectives」 change form depending on where they are in the sentence. At the end of a sentence, they will always be followed by 「だ」, or 「です」 (except in casual conversation where 「だ」 is omitted). However, when used before the word they are describing, they will always be followed by 「な」. Hence the name 「な-Adjectives」.\n\nIn many sentences, either 「は」 or 「が」 could be used to mark the word/words that the predicate is describing. Which one sounds more natural will depend on many factors. For example, if you are specifically pointing out something as being different from other things in the same category, 「が」 will often be used.\n\n**Fun Fact**\n\nMost 「な-Adjectives」 are words of foreign (Chinese/English) origin.",
