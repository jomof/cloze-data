        "function": "To indicate the duration of time leading up to the present moment, often emphasizing continuity or a record-breaking event."
    },
    "etymology": "「来 (rai)」 literally means \"coming\" or \"since.\" In this grammatical structure, it indicates the period of time that has \"come\" or passed up to the present. Its usage as a suffix denoting duration traces back to classical Japanese, often found in historical texts and formal documents to succinctly express a timeframe leading up to the present.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「来」 is used to specify a duration of time that has continued up to the present moment. It implies a sense of continuity or a significant event within that timeframe. While it translates broadly to \"for the past X years\" or \"in the last X months,\" its usage is more formal and often appears in written contexts or formal spoken Japanese. There are two primary patterns for its use: [Duration Noun] + 来: This pattern emphasizes that an action, state, or relationship has continued uninterruptedly for the specified period. For example, 「十年来の友人」 (friends for the past ten years) highlights a long-standing friendship. [Duration Noun] + 来 + の + [Noun]: This pattern describes an event or situation as being the most significant, extreme, or unprecedented within the given duration. For instance, 「五十年来の大雪」 (the heaviest snow in fifty years) denotes a record-breaking occurrence. 「来」 is often used in situations where one wants to convey a sense of historical significance, long-term commitment, or a notable event that breaks a past record. It's important to remember its formal tone, as more casual expressions are typically used in everyday conversations.",

            "kind": "often confused with",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「来」 which emphasizes continuity or a record up to the present, 「ぶり」 focuses on the reappearance of something after a specified duration of absence. For example, 「五年ぶりの再会」 (reunion after five years) implies five years since the last meeting."

            "nuance": "While both can indicate a starting point leading to the present, 「以来」 is typically used with a specific event or point in time (e.g., 「卒業以来」 - since graduation), whereas 「来」 is combined directly with a duration noun to indicate 'for the past X years/months'."

            "etymology": "The verb 「追いかける」 combines 「追う」 (to chase) and 「かける」 (to begin, to attach), implying an action that has been continuously pursued or dedicated to over time. The concept of chasing a dream is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture, often associated with diligence and perseverance."
