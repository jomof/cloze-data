        "usage-context": "Used to express one's general liking or love for an action or activity. It specifically highlights the action itself rather than a tangible object.",
        "function": "Nominalizes a verb phrase to serve as the subject of the adjectival noun '好き', indicating a preference for performing an action.",
        "nuance": "This construction emphasizes the *act* of doing something. The nominalizer の turns the preceding verb into a noun phrase, making the entire phrase the subject of 好き. が is used as a subject marker for the adjectival noun 好き.",
        "source": "Bunpro"
    },
    "etymology": "The construction 「のが好き」 combines the nominalizer 「の」, the particle 「が」, and the adjectival noun 「好き」 (suki, meaning 'like' or 'love'). The 「の」 turns the preceding verb phrase into a noun, which then becomes the subject of 「好き」. The particle 「が」 is used to mark the subject of an adjective or an adjectival noun like 「好き」.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「〜のが好き」 is a fundamental construction in Japanese used to convey that one likes or loves **doing** a particular action or activity. It is always used with verbs in their dictionary (plain) form, regardless of whether they are Ichidan or Godan verbs.\n\nAt its core, 「の」 functions as a nominalizer, transforming the preceding verb phrase into a noun. This newly formed noun phrase then acts as the subject of 「好き」. The particle 「が」 is essential here because 「好き」 is an adjectival noun, and such words require 「が」 to mark their subject. Therefore, while 「〜のは」 exists as a nominalization pattern, 「〜のは好き」 is generally considered unnatural; 「〜のが好き」 is the standard and correct form.\n\nTo express a past liking, the verb preceding 「のが」 remains in its dictionary form, but 「好き」 conjugates to its past tense form, such as 「好きだった」 (plain) or 「好きでした」 (polite).\n\nThis construction is highly versatile and can also be used to inquire about others' preferences by adding 「か」 at the end of the sentence, often followed by 「でしょう」 for polite confirmation.",
