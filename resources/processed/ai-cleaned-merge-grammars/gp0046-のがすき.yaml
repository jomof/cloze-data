        "part-of-speech": "adjective",
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "Used to express one's general liking or love for an action or activity. It specifically highlights the action itself rather than a tangible object. Can be used in both casual and formal contexts.",
        "function": "Nominalizes a verb phrase to serve as the subject of the adjectival noun '好き', indicating a preference for performing an action. The particle 'が' marks this nominalized phrase as the subject.",
        "nuance": "This construction emphasizes the act of doing something. The nominalizer 「の」 turns the preceding verb into a noun phrase, making the entire phrase the subject of 「好き」. 「好き」 is an adjectival noun (形容動詞), which behaves like a noun when conjugated (e.g., 「好きだ」, 「好きです」) but functions adjectivally. The particle 「が」 is used as a subject marker for adjectival nouns and adjectives. Unlike 「こと」, 「の」 is generally preferred for expressing personal preferences related to experiences or actions.",
        "source": "Bunpro"
    },
    "etymology": "The construction 「のが好き」 combines the nominalizer 「の」, the particle 「が」, and the adjectival noun 「好き」 (suki, meaning 'like' or 'love'). The 「の」 turns the preceding verb phrase into a noun, which then becomes the subject of 「好き」. The particle 「が」 is used to mark the subject of an adjective or an adjectival noun like 「好き」. This grammatical pattern reflects a shift from simple object preference (e.g., 「猫が好き」 'I like cats') to a preference for an action or activity (e.g., 「猫と遊ぶのが好き」 'I like playing with cats').",
    "writeup": "The expression 「〜のが好き」 is a fundamental construction in Japanese used to convey that one likes or loves **doing** a particular action or activity. It is always used with verbs in their dictionary (plain) form, regardless of whether they are Ichidan or Godan verbs.\n\nAt its core, 「の」 functions as a nominalizer, transforming the preceding verb phrase into a noun. This newly formed noun phrase then acts as the subject of 「好き」. The particle 「が」 is essential here because 「好き」 is an adjectival noun (形容動詞), and such words require 「が」 to mark their subject. Therefore, while 「〜のは好き」 is grammatically possible, 「〜のが好き」 is the standard and correct form when expressing personal preferences for actions.\n\nTo express a past liking, the verb preceding 「のが」 remains in its dictionary form, but 「好き」 conjugates to its past tense form, such as 「好きだった」 (plain) or 「好きでした」 (polite).\n\nThis construction is highly versatile and can also be used to inquire about others' preferences by adding 「か」 at the end of the sentence, often followed by 「でしょう」 for polite confirmation.",
