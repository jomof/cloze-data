    "etymology": "The construction 「のが好き」 combines the nominalizer 「の」, the particle 「が」, and the adjectival noun 「好き」 (suki, meaning 'like' or 'love'). The 「の」 turns the preceding verb phrase into a noun, which then becomes the subject of 「好き」.",
    "writeup": "「〜のが好き」 is a common construction in Japanese to express that you like or love **doing** something. This expression is used with the dictionary form of verbs.\n\nThe 「の」 is performing nominalization (turning a phrase into a noun). のが is always used with adjectives.\n\nTo express that you *liked* doing something (in the past), the verb remains in the dictionary form, but 「好き」 changes to the past tense, 「好きだった」.\n\nThis construction can also be used to ask questions about what other people like by adding 「か」 at the end of the sentence.",
