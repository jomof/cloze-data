grammar_point: な-Adjective[だ] (plain present)
learn_before:
  - だ (casual copula)
id: gp9999
meaning: is [na-adjective]
pronunciation:
  katakana: ダ
  romaji: da
formation:
  '[な-Adjective Stem] + だ': Used to state a fact or describe a characteristic in a casual, plain affirmative
    present tense.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The copula だ (da) is a contraction of である (de aru). It serves as the plain, informal equivalent
  of です (desu), used to assert facts or describe states of being.
writeup: |-
  な-adjectives, also known as adjectival nouns, describe qualities or states. When a な-adjective directly precedes a noun, it requires な (na) to connect (e.g., きれいな花 - a beautiful flower). However, when a な-adjective is used as a predicate at the end of a sentence in the plain, affirmative present tense, it is followed by だ (da). This form is highly casual and commonly used in everyday conversations among people who are close, such as friends, family members, or colleagues of equal or lower status.

  It's crucial to understand that な-adjectives do not conjugate like い-adjectives. Instead, they behave similarly to nouns in their predicate forms, using forms of the copula (だ, だった, じゃない, じゃなかった, etc.) to express tense and negation. The plain present affirmative form with だ is the most fundamental way to state a characteristic or fact casually.

  For example, to say "It is quiet" in a casual way, you would say 「静かだ」 (Shizuka da). This structure directly states that the subject possesses the quality of being quiet. This form is common in direct speech, monologues, or informal writing.
false_friends:
  - term: です
    meaning: is [polite]
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: です is the polite form of the copula, used in formal or polite contexts. Unlike だ, です can be
      used with both nouns and な-adjectives to form polite affirmative statements. The choice between
      だ and です depends entirely on the level of formality and the relationship between the speakers. We're
      looking for the casual, plain form.
    grammar_point: です (polite copula)
  - term: い-Adjectives (sentence-ending)
    meaning: is [i-adjective]
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: い-adjectives directly end sentences without a copula like だ or です in the plain form (e.g.,
      寒い - cold). な-adjectives, when used as predicates, *require* だ in their plain affirmative form.
      This is a key difference in their grammatical behavior. We're looking for the na-adjective form
      ending in だ.
    grammar_point: い-adjective (sentence-ending)
  - term: じゃない
    meaning: is not [noun/na-adjective]
    kind: antonym
    nuance: じゃない is the plain negative form for both nouns and な-adjectives. While な-Adjective[だ] affirms
      a characteristic, じゃない denies it. For example, 静かだ (It is quiet) versus 静かじゃない (It is not quiet).
      We're looking for the affirmative plain form.
    grammar_point: な-Adjective[ではない・じゃない] (plain negative)
  - term: だった
    meaning: was [noun/na-adjective]
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: だった is the plain past affirmative form for nouns and な-adjectives. It indicates that something
      *was* a certain way in the past, while な-Adjective[だ] indicates it *is* a certain way in the present.
      We're looking for the present tense.
    grammar_point: だった (past copula, casual)
post_false_friends_writeup: When differentiating な-Adjective[だ] from other forms, remember that だ explicitly
  marks the casual, plain present tense for な-adjectives acting as predicates. Its absence or replacement
  with other particles/copula forms changes the politeness, tense, or part of speech. For instance, comparing
  楽しい (tanoshii - い-adjective, plain present) with 静かだ (shizuka da - な-adjective, plain present) highlights
  their distinct grammatical endings. Understanding that な-adjectives conjugate like nouns in their predicate
  role, taking forms of the copula, is crucial.

post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how な-Adjective[だ] is consistently used to casually state
  a characteristic or quality in the present tense. Notice that the use of だ does not change based on
  the gender or age of the speaker or listener when simply stating a fact, but its casual nature dictates
  the social context. It is a fundamental building block for expressing descriptive information in informal
  Japanese.
