    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point originates from the volitional form of a verb (expressing will or intent), followed by 「ではないか」. 「よう」 signifies intention or invitation. 「では」 is a contraction of 「それでは」 (in that case), and 「ないか」 is a rhetorical question particle seeking agreement. Historically, this combination evolved to form a polite, persuasive, and sometimes forceful way of suggesting a course of action, akin to \"Shall we not do X?\" which implies \"Let's do X.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[volitional-よう]ではないか」 is a formal expression used to make suggestions for mutual activities or to invite someone to do something together. It combines the volitional form (〜う/〜よう) of a verb with 「ではないか」. The volitional form expresses intent, similar to \"let's\" or \"shall\" in English.\n\nWhile a literal translation might seem negative, such as \"shall we not do (A)?\", its actual meaning is an affirmative call to action: \"Let's do (A)\" or \"Why don't we do (A)?\" The negative phrasing and rhetorical question create a persuasive nuance, implying that the suggested action is the logical or desirable course.\n\n**Formality and Usage:**\n*   This structure is generally formal and is often encountered in speeches, formal proposals, or situations where the speaker wants to sound authoritative, persuasive, or encouraging. It implies a collective undertaking.\n*   A more polite version is 「Verb[volitional-よう]ではありませんか」.\n*   Conversely, a more casual version, 「Verb[volitional-よう]じゃないか」, also exists and is used in less formal settings, though it still carries a sense of strong suggestion or rhetorical questioning.\n\n**Specific Nuances:**\n*   When preceded by 「もらう」, as in 「〜てもらおうではないか」, it can take on a challenging nuance, implying \"Why don't I have you do (A)?\" or \"You should do (A), shouldn't you?\" This usage subtly shifts the responsibility or initiative to the listener.",

Use 「Verb[volitional-よう]ではないか」 in situations where you want to be polite, persuasive, or inspiring in a formal setting. 「Verb[volitional-よう]じゃないか」 serves a similar persuasive function but in casual contexts. In contrast, a simple 「Verb[volitional-よう]」 is a direct and casual statement of intent or invitation without the rhetorical weight.",
