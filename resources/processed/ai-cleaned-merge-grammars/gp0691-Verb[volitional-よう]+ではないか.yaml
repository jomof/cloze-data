    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ようではないか」 is composed of 「よう」 (the volitional form indicating intent), 「ではない」 (a polite negative form of 「だ」), and 「か」 (a question particle). The combination creates a rhetorical question suggesting a course of action.",
    "writeup": "「ようではないか」 is primarily used to suggest mutual activities in a somewhat formal manner. It combines the auxiliary verbs 「う」 or 「よう」, 「ではない」, and the sentence-ending particle 「か」. 「う」 and 「よう」 express intent, similar to \"shall\" in English. The negation implies a meaning close to \"shall we not do (A)?\" However, it's best understood as \"let's do (A)\" or \"why don't we do (A).\" As with 「う」 and 「よう」, 「ようではないか」 attaches to the volitional form of a verb. Although 「じゃない」 can replace 「ではない」, the full form is more common due to the structure's formality. A more polite version is 「ようではありませんか」. Occasionally, you may see 「もらう」 before this structure, challenging the listener to do something, interpretable as \"why don't I have you do (A) then?\"",
