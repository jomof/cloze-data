    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the volitional form of a verb (to express intent), followed by 「ではないか」, which is a rhetorical question seeking agreement or inviting action. 「よう」 expresses intention or invitation, 「では」 is a contraction of 「それでは」 (in that case), 「ないか」 is a question seeking agreement. Together, they create a polite and somewhat forceful way of suggesting a course of action.",
    "writeup": "「Verb[volitional-よう]ではないか」 is a formal expression used to make suggestions or invite someone to do something together. It's a combination of the volitional form (う/よう) of a verb, 「ではない」, and the question particle 「か」. The volitional form expresses intent, similar to \"let's\" in English. The 「ではない」 part adds a nuance of seeking agreement, turning the statement into a rhetorical question. It's similar to saying \"Shall we not do...?\" but is better translated as \"Let's do...\" or \"Why don't we...?\"\n\n*   **Formality:** This expression is quite formal and is often used in speeches, meetings, or written documents. A more polite version is 「ようではありませんか」.\n*   **Usage:** It's used when you want to propose a course of action and want to sound persuasive or encouraging. It can also be used to challenge someone to do something, especially when preceded by 「もらう」 (to receive).",
