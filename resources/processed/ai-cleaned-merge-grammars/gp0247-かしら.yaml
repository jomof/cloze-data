    "etymology": "The particle 「かしら」 originally comes from 「か知らぬ」 or 「かしらん」, meaning \"I don't know if...\" Over time, it evolved into a standalone sentence-ending particle expressing uncertainty or doubt. Essentially, it's a shortened way of saying, \"I wonder if that's the case.\"",
    "writeup": "「かしら」 is a sentence-ending particle used to express uncertainty or a sense of wondering about something. It is similar to 「かも」. It's attached to the end of a phrase or sentence. While historically usable by anyone, in modern Japanese, 「かしら」 is primarily used by women. Men generally avoid it to prevent sounding feminine. Consider it a feminine equivalent to male-oriented sentence-ending particles.",

The original examples contained N2 and N3 kanji.",

        "unnatural: Kept all speaker genders as 'female' in examples despite the general rule to include 'at least one male and one female speaker_gender'. This was done to ensure the examples remain natural and accurate to the grammar point's inherent usage, as 'かしら' is strongly associated with female speech in modern Japanese, and using it with a male speaker would contradict the explicit 'writeup' and 'nuance' about its gender-specific nature."
