    "etymology": "The particle 「かしら」 originally comes from 「か知らぬ」 or 「かしらん」, meaning \"I don't know if...\" Over time, it evolved into a standalone sentence-ending particle expressing uncertainty or doubt. Essentially, it's a shortened way of saying, \"I wonder if that's the case.\"",
    "writeup": "「かしら」 is a sentence-ending particle used to express uncertainty or a sense of wondering about something. It is similar to 「かも」. It's attached to the end of a phrase or sentence. While historically usable by anyone, in modern Japanese, 「かしら」 is primarily used by women. Men generally avoid it to prevent sounding feminine. Consider it a feminine equivalent to male-oriented sentence-ending particles.",
