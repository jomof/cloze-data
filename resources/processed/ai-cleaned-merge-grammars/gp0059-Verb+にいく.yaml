    "etymology": "The grammar point 「Verb+にいく」 combines a verb stem with the particle 「に」 and the verb 「いく」(to go). The 「に」 particle indicates direction or purpose. Together, they express the idea of going *for the purpose of* doing something. This construction is a fundamental way to express intention and movement in Japanese, reflecting the importance of purpose in action.",
    "writeup": "「Verb+にいく」 is used to express the act of going somewhere for a specific purpose. The verb preceding 「にいく」 must be in its stem form (masu-stem). This construction translates to \"to go to do something\" or \"to go in order to do something.\" The 「に」 particle here is crucial; it explicitly marks the purpose or objective of the movement, distinguishing it from simply stating a destination. For instance, while 「スーパーへ行く」(go to the supermarket) states a destination, 「買い物 に 行く」(go to shop) specifies the reason for going. If you have already gone somewhere to do something, you would use 「(Verb stem) に 来た」 instead. This grammar point is essential for expressing intentions and activities involving movement.",
