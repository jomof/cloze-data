        "[Verb stem] + にいく": "Indicates going somewhere to perform a specific action, focusing on the purpose of the movement"

        "grammatical-role": "Indicates the purpose or objective of the verb of movement (いく, くる, かえるなど)."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「Verb+にいく」 combines a verb stem with the particle 「に」 and the verb 「いく」(to go). The 「に」 particle indicates direction or purpose. Together, they express the idea of going *for the purpose of* doing something. This construction is a fundamental way to express intention and movement in Japanese, reflecting the importance of purpose in action. Historically, this use of 「に」 as a purpose marker for verbs of movement is deeply ingrained in the language, deriving from its core function of marking a goal or destination.",
    "writeup": "「Verb+にいく」 is used to express the act of going somewhere for a specific purpose. The verb preceding 「にいく」 must be in its stem form (masu-stem), effectively making it a nominalized action. This construction translates to \"to go to do something\" or \"to go in order to do something.\" The 「に」 particle here is crucial; it explicitly marks the purpose or objective of the movement, distinguishing it from simply stating a destination. For instance, while 「スーパーへ行く」(go to the supermarket) states a destination, 「買い物 に 行く」(go to shop) specifies the reason for going. If you have already gone somewhere to do something, you would use 「(Verb stem) に 来た」 instead. This grammar point is essential for expressing intentions and activities involving movement. It is a highly versatile construction that can be adapted to various registers and conjugations depending on the context.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene implies a movement to a location (e.g., library or cafe) to perform the action, which '読みに いく' specifically conveys, unlike simply stating '友達 と 本 を 読む' (read a book with a friend) without emphasizing the journey."

            "nuance": "The polite form 「買いにいきます」 is appropriate for a professional setting, like speaking to a colleague. It politely states one's intention to go and buy clothes, and the use of 「いきます」 makes the statement respectful without implying specific gender-related speech patterns."

            "nuance": "The plain past form 「迎えにいった」 is typical for casual conversations among partners, simply stating a completed action with purpose. The nuance is direct and straightforward, a common, gender-neutral way to talk about past movement for a specific reason."

The key is to recognize the core intent: purpose, destination, or continuation/change. Additionally, understand that simply stating the verb (e.g., 「食べる」) implies the action, but not necessarily that one is going somewhere to do it. 「食べにいく」 distinctly adds the element of purposeful movement.",
