    "etymology": "The grammar point 「Verb+にいく」 combines a verb stem with the particle 「に」 and the verb 「いく」(to go). The 「に」 particle indicates direction or purpose. Together, they express the idea of going *for the purpose of* doing something. This construction is a fundamental way to express intention and movement in Japanese, reflecting the importance of purpose in action. Historically, this use of 「に」 as a purpose marker for verbs of movement is deeply ingrained in the language, deriving from its core function of marking a goal or destination.",
    "writeup": "「Verb+にいく」 is used to express the act of going somewhere for a specific purpose. The verb preceding 「にいく」 must be in its stem form (masu-stem), effectively making it a nominalized action. This construction translates to \"to go to do something\" or \"to go in order to do something.\" The 「に」 particle here is crucial; it explicitly marks the purpose or objective of the movement, distinguishing it from simply stating a destination. For instance, while 「スーパーへ行く」(go to the supermarket) states a destination, 「買い物 に 行く」(go to shop) specifies the reason for going. If you have already gone somewhere to do something, you would use 「(Verb stem) に 来た」 instead. This grammar point is essential for expressing intentions and activities involving movement. It is a highly versatile construction that can be adapted to various registers and conjugations depending on the context.",

            "nuance": "「へ いく」 simply indicates the destination and doesn't imply the specific purpose of going for an action, unlike 「Verb+に いく」. For example, 「学校 へ いく」 means 'go to school,' but doesn't specify *why* you're going there beyond attending."

            "nuance": "「て いく」 indicates a continuous action or a change over time, or an action performed as one moves away, while 「Verb+に いく」 focuses solely on the purpose of going somewhere to perform an action.

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When differentiating between these expressions, remember that 「Verb+にいく」 is singular in its focus: the purpose of the movement. 「へいく」 clarifies the destination, while 「ていく」 describes how an action unfolds over time or extends away from the speaker. The key is to recognize the core intent: purpose, destination, or continuation/change. Additionally, understand that simply stating the verb (e.g., 「食べる」) implies the action, but not necessarily that one is going somewhere to do it. 「食べに いく」 distinctly adds the element of purposeful movement.",
