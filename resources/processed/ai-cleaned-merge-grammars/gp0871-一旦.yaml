    "etymology": "「一旦」 originally comes from the noun 「一旦」 meaning \"one morning,\" or \"one brief period.\" The 「旦」 kanji itself signifies \"daybreak\" or \"dawn.\" This can be a useful way to remember 「一旦」 as the \"dawning\" of some period that will not end until it has run its natural course.",
    "writeup": "「一旦」 is an adverb meaning \"for a short time,\" or \"briefly,\" and indicates that \"once (A), (B).\" When combined with hypothetical structures like 「ば」, 「と」, or 「たら」, it suggests that returning to the previous state will be difficult, at least for a short time.\n\nOther common translations include \"for the time being\" and \"for now.\" 「一旦」 primarily appears at the beginning of sentences or directly before a 「ば」, 「と」, or 「たら」 modified verb.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   The meaning of 「一旦」 often implies a sense of commitment or a difficulty in reversing the action. Think of it as a point of no return, at least temporarily.\n*   「一旦」 can be rephrased to 「一度」, but not always the other way around. 「一度」 simply means \"once\" or \"one time,\" without the added nuance of commitment.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene emphasizes that the reboot is a necessary and significant step to fix a problem, implying a lasting effect rather than a one-time event, which steers the learner towards `一旦`."
