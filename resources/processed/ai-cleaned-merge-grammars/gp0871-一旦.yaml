    },
    "etymology": "「一旦」 originally comes from the noun 「一旦」, meaning \"one morning\" or \"one brief period.\" The kanji 「旦」 itself signifies \"daybreak\" or \"dawn,\" visually representing the sun rising above the horizon. This historical meaning can serve as a memory tool, visualizing 「一旦」 as the \"dawning\" of some period or state that, once begun, will run its natural course and may not be easily reversed.",
    "writeup": "「一旦」 is an adverb with two primary meanings: \"once (A), then (B)\" where (B) implies a state that is difficult to reverse, and \"temporarily\" or \"for the time being.\" \n\nWhen used in the sense of \"once (A), then (B),\" 「一旦」 is often followed by hypothetical or conditional structures such as 「～ば」, 「～と」, or 「～たら」. In such constructions, it emphasizes that an action, once initiated, leads to a situation from which it is difficult to return or to undo. This nuance implies a significant shift or a point of no return, at least for a period.\n\nThe second meaning, \"temporarily\" or \"for the time being,\" indicates a brief suspension or a provisional action. In this usage, 「一旦」 can appear directly before a verb or at the beginning of a sentence to suggest a temporary halt or a momentary action before something else occurs or resumes. For example, 「一旦停止する」 (to temporarily stop) or 「一旦考える」 (to think for a moment).\n\n「一旦」 is typically placed at the beginning of a sentence or immediately preceding the verb or conditional clause it modifies. Its usage often conveys a sense of decisiveness or an unavoidable progression of events once a certain threshold is crossed.",

            "kind": "often confused with",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「一旦」, 「一度」 simply indicates a single occurrence without the implication of a lasting impact, difficulty in reversing the action, or a temporary pause. It merely states that something happened one time."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「一旦」 and 「一度」 can be translated as \"once,\" their nuances differ significantly. 「一旦」 carries the implication of a definitive step that makes it difficult to return to a previous state, or a temporary action taken for the time being. In contrast, 「一度」 refers solely to a single instance or occurrence, without these added implications of consequence or temporariness. Therefore, 「一旦」 cannot always be replaced by 「一度」 without altering the meaning.",
