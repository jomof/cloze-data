    "etymology": "The grammar point にしても is formed from に, a case-marking particle indicating location or circumstance, and しても, the te-form of する (to do) combined with も (also, even). Etymologically, it suggests \"even in the circumstance of doing.\"",
    "writeup": "**にしても** expresses the idea of \"even if,\" \"even though,\" or \"no matter what.\" It often highlights a surprising or unexpected fact. It can be used with verbs, adjectives, and nouns in their plain form. It emphasizes that even considering a certain condition or situation, something else is still true or relevant. Unlike としても, にしても can introduce new topics because it implies that (A) and (B) exist simultaneously, without the need for (B) to necessarily stem from (A).",
