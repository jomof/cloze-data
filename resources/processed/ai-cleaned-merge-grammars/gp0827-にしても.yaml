        "nuance": "Highlights a surprising or unexpected outcome (B) despite a preceding condition (A). When used with interrogatives, it conveys a sense of universality or indifference regarding the specific detail. Unlike としても, にしても does not necessarily imply a causal link from A to B.",

    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point にしても is formed from に, a case-marking particle indicating location or circumstance, and しても, the te-form of する (to do) combined with も (also, even). Etymologically, it suggests \"even in the circumstance of doing.\" This construction evolves to express concession, implying that something holds true 'even if' a particular circumstance or decision is present.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point **にしても** expresses the idea of \"even if,\" \"even though,\" or \"no matter what.\" It serves to highlight a surprising or unexpected consequence or truth that exists despite a given condition or premise. It can also function to add an additional point, similar to \"as for X, too\" or \"even (so).\"\n\n**にしても** can attach to verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns, typically in their plain (dictionary) forms. For な-adjectives and nouns, the copula だ (or its past forms, e.g., だった, であった) may be present or omitted, depending on the desired nuance and naturalness.\n\n### Key Usage and Nuances\n\n1.  **Concessive (Even if / Even though):** This is the most common usage. It establishes a concession, emphasizing that the main clause's content is true despite the condition in the preceding clause. The focus is on the unexpected or noteworthy nature of the main clause, given the preceding information.\n    *   Example: 「雨が降る**にしても**、傘は持っていかない。」 (Even if it rains, I won't take an umbrella.) Here, the speaker acknowledges the possibility of rain but states an unexpected action.\n\n2.  **With Interrogative Words (No matter what / where / who):** When combined with interrogative words (like どこ, だれ, なに, etc.), **にしても** indicates universality or indifference. It signifies that the following statement holds true regardless of the specific detail identified by the interrogative.\n    *   Example: 「どこへ行く**にしても**、パスポートは必要だ。」 (No matter where you go, a passport is necessary.)\n\n3.  **Additive / Inclusive (As for X, too / Even so):** In some contexts, **にしても** can highlight that something is true for the stated subject or condition, implying that it might be true for others as well, or that even considering that particular case, a certain outcome applies.\n    *   Example: 「彼**にしても**、その話は初めてだった。」 (Even for him, that story was new.) This implies that it was new for others too, or that his reaction was noteworthy because he usually knows everything.\n\n### Distinction from としても\n\nWhile similar, **にしても** and **としても** have subtle but important differences. **としても** typically introduces a hypothetical assumption or a concessive clause where the subsequent statement is a logical consequence of that assumption. It often implies a closer causal link or a ",
