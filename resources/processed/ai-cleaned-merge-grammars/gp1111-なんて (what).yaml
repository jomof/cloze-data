        "usage-context": "Primarily used in informal conversations and expressions of strong personal feeling or inquiry. It serves as a colloquial alternative to the more formal 「なんと」."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「なんて」 is a colloquial contraction of 「何と」 (nanto), which literally means \"what\" or \"how\". Over time, it has evolved to express surprise, disbelief, or emphasis, similar to how \"what\" can be used in English (e.g., \"What a surprise!\"). It can also function as a way to downplay something, like saying \"it's nothing.\"",
    "writeup": "「なんて」 is a highly versatile and frequently used expression in spoken Japanese. It functions as a colloquial counterpart to the more formal 「なんと」 (nanto). While 「なんと」 is typically found in written language or formal speeches, 「なんて」 lends a more natural and direct tone to conversation.\n\nThis grammar point encompasses several distinct usages:\n\n1.  **Interrogative (What/What kind of)**: When 「なんて」 precedes a verb of communication like 「言う」 (iu, to say) or 「書く」 (kaku, to write), it functions to inquire about the content of what was said or written, or the name of something. For instance, 「なんて言った？」 asks \"What did you say?\" or \"What did they say?\".\n\n2.  **Exclamatory (How ~! / What a ~!)**: This is a very common usage, expressing strong emotions such as surprise, admiration, or disbelief. It often pairs with adjectives or nouns followed by 「だろう」 or 「ことだ」. For example, 「なんてきれいなんだろう」 conveys \"How beautiful!\" or \"What a beautiful thing!\" The nuance can range from genuine awe to dismay, depending on the context and the accompanying adjective or noun. The structure is typically 「なんて」 + {い-Adjective (plain form) / な-Adjective (stem) + な / Noun + な} + 「んだろう」 or 「ことだ」.\n\n3.  **Downplaying (Nothing / No big deal)**: 「なんてことない」 or 「なんてことはない」 is used to dismiss something as minor or insignificant. It implies that a situation or task is not a problem or is easily manageable, conveying a sense of casual indifference or resilience. For example, 「これくらいなんてことないよ」 means \"This much is nothing (no big deal).\"\n\nUnderstanding 「なんて」 is crucial for natural conversation as it allows for a nuanced expression of emotions and inquiries in a colloquial setting.",
