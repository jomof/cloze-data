    "etymology": "The term 「なんて」 is a colloquial contraction of 「何と」 (nanto), which literally means \"what\" or \"how\". Over time, it has evolved to express surprise, disbelief, or emphasis, similar to how \"what\" can be used in English (e.g., \"What a surprise!\"). It can also function as a way to downplay something, like saying \"it's nothing.\"",
    "writeup": "「なんて」 is a versatile expression used mainly in casual conversation. It functions similarly to \"what\" or \"how\" in English, expressing surprise, admiration, or disbelief. It can also be used to downplay something, implying it's not a big deal. It's important to note that 「なんて」 is generally considered more colloquial than its formal counterpart, 「なんと」.",
