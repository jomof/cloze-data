    "details": {
        "Register": "Polite. Used to show respect to the listener or the subject of the sentence.",
        "Usage": "Can be used with nouns, adjectives, and verbs. For verbs, it's often used with 「になる」 for honorific expressions and 「する」 for humble expressions.",
        "Restrictions": "Not all nouns, adjectives, and verbs can be prefixed with 「お」. Generally used with native Japanese words (和語), not loanwords (外来語) or words of Chinese origin (漢語). However, there are exceptions."
    },
    "etymology": "The prefix 「お」 is derived from the honorific prefix 「御 (おん)」, which itself comes from classical Japanese. Over time, 「御」 simplified to 「お」 for easier use in everyday speech. It is often written in hiragana to distinguish it from the kanji 「御」.",
    "writeup": "The prefix 「お」 is used to add politeness and respect to nouns, adjectives, and verbs. It's a fundamental aspect of polite Japanese and shows consideration for the listener or the subject of the sentence. It's essential to note that 「お」 is typically attached to native Japanese words (和語), not loanwords (外来語) or words of Chinese origin (漢語). However, there are many exceptions to this rule, so learning through exposure and context is key.\n\n*   **Nouns:** Attaching 「お」 to nouns elevates the politeness of the word. Examples: 「お名前 (onamae)」 (name), 「お茶 (ocha)」 (tea), 「お弁当 (obentou)」 (boxed lunch).\n*   **Adjectives:** 「お」 can be attached to the stem of い-adjectives and な-adjectives to make them more polite. Examples: 「お忙しい (oisogashii)」 (busy), 「お元気 (ogenki)」 (healthy/well).\n*   **Verbs:** When used with verbs, 「お」 is combined with 「になる」 for honorific expressions (when someone else is doing the action) and with 「する」 for humble expressions (when the speaker is doing the action). Examples: 「お読みになる (oyomininaru)」 (to read - honorific), 「お持ちします (omochishimasu)」 (to hold - humble).\n\nIt's important to remember that not all words can take the 「お」 prefix, and using it inappropriately can sound unnatural or even sarcastic. Learning which words commonly take 「お」 is crucial for speaking polite and natural Japanese. Pay attention to how native speakers use it and imitate their usage.",
