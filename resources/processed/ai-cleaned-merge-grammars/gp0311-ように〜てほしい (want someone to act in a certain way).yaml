        "nuance": "The combination of 「ように」 (indicating manner, purpose, or comparison) and 「〜てほしい」 (expressing a desire for another's action) creates a nuance of wishing for a specific way of doing things or for a state to be achieved. It implies a degree of indirectness or a focus on the process/outcome rather than a direct command. It can also be used to express a wish for oneself to be able to do something (e.g., in a particular manner)."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ように〜てほしい」 is a compound structure formed from two distinct elements: 「ように」 and 「〜てほしい」. The adverbial particle 「ように」 derives from the noun 「様 (よう)」, meaning 'appearance' or 'state'. Over time, 「ように」 evolved to indicate a simile ('like'), purpose ('in order to'), or desired state. The expression 「〜てほしい」 is a volitional form that indicates a desire for someone else to perform an action. 「ほしい」 itself is an adjective meaning 'desirable' or 'wanted', originating from the classical Japanese verb 「欲し (ほし)」. The combination 「ように〜てほしい」 thus expresses a desire for an action to be performed in a certain manner or for a certain state to be achieved, reflecting its etymological roots in appearance, purpose, and desire.",
    "writeup": "「ように〜てほしい」 combines the auxiliary verb 「ようだ」 with the 「てほしい」 structure, indicating that you or someone else wants someone to do something. 「ようだ」 takes the adverbial form 「ように」 when linked to a verb later in the sentence. This expression highlights that you want someone to do something \"in the way of (A)\" or \"so that (A)\" happens. When 「ように」 follows a noun, 「の」 is required. Either 「に」 or 「が」 may mark the thing that the speaker wants to happen, with 「に」 often marking people and 「が」 marking events or objects. Note that 「が」 and 「に」 may be switched to avoid repetition or confusion about the subject of the sentence. This grammar point primarily functions to express a wish for an action to be performed in a specific manner or for a particular result to be achieved.",
