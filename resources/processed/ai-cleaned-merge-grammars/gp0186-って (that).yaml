    "writeup": "「って」 is a casual alternative to 「と」 when quoting or reporting information. Think of it as a more relaxed way to say \"that\" or \"I heard that...\" It's frequently used in informal conversations and can add a sense of immediacy. Unlike 「と」, 「って」 isn't typically used in formal writing or speech. It is **important** to remember that while 「って」 is often interchangeable with 「と」, some contexts may favor one over the other depending on the desired level of formality.",
