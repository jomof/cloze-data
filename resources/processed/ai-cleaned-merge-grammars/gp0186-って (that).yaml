    "writeup": "「って」 is a casual alternative to 「と」 when quoting or reporting information. Think of it as a more relaxed way to say \"that\" or \"I heard that...\" It's frequently used in informal conversations and can add a sense of immediacy. Unlike 「と」, 「って」 isn't typically used in formal writing or speech. It is **important** to remember that while 「って」 is often interchangeable with 「と」, some contexts may favor one over the other depending on the desired level of formality. Additionally, 「って」 can also function similarly to 「から」 (because) or even as a casual topic marker, adding emphasis to the preceding information.",
