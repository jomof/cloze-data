meaning: since (an action), nothing has changed or nothing else has happened

    or nothing else has happened.
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to express that an action occurred, and ever since, a particular state has persisted
    without change, or no further action has taken place. It often implies a sense of stagnation or unexpected
    lack of follow-up.
  function: Connects a past action with a continuing state or lack of subsequent action.
  nuance: Carries a nuance of 'only once' or 'ever since that time,' emphasizing the lack of change or
    further events. It can sometimes imply regret or an unexpected outcome.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a phrase that modifies the main clause, setting a temporal condition.
etymology: The word 「きり」 (kiri) is believed to derive from 「切り」, meaning 'cut' or 'end'. When combined
  with the past tense of a verb, it signifies that an action was 'cut off' or 'ended' at that point, leading
  to the meaning of 'since then' with no further development. This emphasizes the finality of the action
  at that specific past moment, and the unchanging state that follows.
writeup: |-
  The grammar pattern 「Verb[た]きり」 is used to describe a situation where an action was performed in the past, and ever since that moment, a specific condition has continued without change, or nothing further has occurred. It strongly emphasizes the lack of subsequent action or development after the initial event.

  This pattern often implies a sense of stagnation, an unexpected lack of follow-up, or even regret that things did not progress. It can also be used neutrally to simply state that a state has remained constant since a certain past action.

  It is important to note that the state or lack of action described by 「きり」 must be ongoing up to the present moment or the time of the statement. If the state has changed, this pattern would not be appropriate.

  - term: 〜きり (only・just)
    meaning: only; just
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「[Verb-た]きり」 focuses on a continuing state since a past action, 「〜きり」 (used with nouns
      or quantities) typically means 'only' or 'just' a limited amount, emphasizing the scarcity or restriction.
      For example, 「一人きり」 means 'only one person'. We're looking for a state that has continued unchanged
      since a past action.
    grammar_point: 〜きり (only・just)
  - term: 〜たまま (as is・unchanged)
    meaning: as is; without change; in the state of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜たまま」 indicates that an action was completed, and a certain state resulting from that action
      continues without change. It describes the state something is 'left in'. Unlike 「[Verb-た]きり」, it
      doesn't necessarily imply a lack of subsequent action or development, but simply describes the persistent
      state. We're looking for a continuing state or lack of change *since* an action.
    grammar_point: 〜まま(に) (as is・unchanged)
  - term: '[Verb-た]っきり'
    meaning: since (an action), (nothing has changed) - colloquial
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「[Verb-た]っきり」 is a more colloquial and emphatic variant of 「[Verb-た]きり」. It carries the exact
      same meaning of 'since that time, nothing has changed' but is often used in more casual speech.
      We're looking for the standard form of this expression.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:[Verb-た]っきり (since・no change, colloquial)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between 「[Verb-た]きり」 and 「〜きり」, remember that the former
  emphasizes the persistence of a state or lack of event *since* a past action, while the latter generally
  indicates 'only' a certain quantity or limited scope. For instance, 「彼は一度行ったきりだ」 (He went once and that's
  it; he hasn't gone again) uses 「[Verb-た]きり」 to imply a lack of subsequent visits, whereas 「彼は一人きりだ」
  (He's all alone) uses 「〜きり」 to state a singular condition. 「〜たまま」, on the other hand, describes a state
  that was maintained from the completion of an action, focusing on how something was left rather than
  the non-occurrence of further events.
examples:
  - english: My grandfather went to the hospital last year and hasn't come back since.
    japanese:
      - 祖父 は 去年 病院 へ {行っ た きり}、戻っ て き ませ ん。
      - 祖父 は 去年 病院 へ {行っ た きり}、戻っ て こ ない。
      - 祖父 は 去年 病院 へ {行っ た きり} で、戻っ て き て おり ませ ん。

        english: My grandfather went to the hospital last year and remains in the state of having gone,
          not having come back.
        hint: 「〜たまま」 emphasizes the state of being 'left as is' after an action. Here, we want to emphasize
          the lack of change *since* the action. We're looking for a state that has continued unchanged
          since a past action.

        english: My grandfather went to the hospital last year, and after that, hasn't come back.
        hint: 「〜てから」 simply states a sequence of events. While it shows the temporal order, it doesn't
          carry the strong nuance of 'nothing has changed since' that 「〜きり」 does. We're looking for a
          state that has continued unchanged since a past action.

          - 弟 は 先週 ゲーム を {買っ て から}、ずっと やっ て い ます。
        english: My younger brother bought a game last week, and since then, has been playing it.
        hint: While 「〜てから」 conveys the start and continuation, 「〜きり」 emphasizes that the only thing that
          has happened since buying the game is playing it, implying an unchanging routine. We're looking
          for a state that has continued unchanged since a past action.
    scene: A sibling is complaining about their brother's habits.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The phrase 「買ったきり、ずっとやっています」 highlights that the only significant activity the younger brother
      has engaged in since buying the game is playing it, implying a single-minded focus without other
      developments. The speaker, being male, might use a slightly more direct tone in casual conversation.
  - english: She said she'd be right back for a moment and hasn't returned since.
    japanese:

        english: She went out for a moment, and after that, hasn't returned.
        hint: While 「〜てから」 indicates a simple chronological sequence, 「〜たきり」 conveys the added nuance
          that her not returning is unexpected or a continued state since she left. We're looking for
          a state that has continued unchanged since a past action.
    scene: Two friends are waiting for someone who left briefly.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「出たきり」 suggests an ongoing absence that is perhaps longer than expected or implies
      that she left and has done nothing else since then (like contacting them). A female speaker might
      use this to express a mild sense of frustration or concern to another female friend, as it's common
      for women to share such observations.

        hint: While 「〜始めてから」 conveys the start and continuation, 「〜たきり」 emphasizes that *only* barking
          has been happening since that moment, implying a singular, unwavering action. We're looking
          for a state that has continued unchanged since a past action.

        hint: 「〜てから」 sets a starting point but doesn't emphasize the lack of subsequent action quite as
          strongly as 「〜たきり」, which implies a direct continuation of the 'not returning' state since graduation.

          for a state that has continued unchanged since a past action.

        hint: 「〜のに」 expresses a contrast or unexpected outcome, but not necessarily a continuous state
          since an action. 「〜たきり」 emphasizes that the only thing that happened since borrowing was a continued

        hint: 「〜てから」 denotes a starting point. 「〜たきり」 adds the nuance that the lack of further encounters

post_example_writeup: As illustrated in the examples, 「[Verb-た]きり」 is highly effective for conveying that
  a specific state has persisted without alteration since a particular past action. It often implies that
  no other significant events or changes have occurred in relation to that initial action. This makes
  it particularly useful for expressing situations of continuity, stagnation, or even a sense of being
  'stuck' in a certain condition.
