id: gp0842
meaning: Since [action], a state has continued unchanged.
pronunciation:
  katakana: キリ
  romaji: kiri
formation:
  Verb (past plain form) + きり: Indicates that an action occurred once, leading to a continuous and unchanging
    state or consequence thereafter.
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: general use
etymology: The term 「きり」 comes from the verb 「切る (きる)」, meaning "to cut." The nuance is that something
  has been "cut off" or limited to a certain extent.
writeup: The particle 「きり」, when attached to the past plain form of a verb (`[Verb-た]きり`), conveys that
  a specific action occurred once, and ever since that singular event, a continuous and unchanging state
  or consequence has persisted. It implies a definitive cessation or limitation, almost as if something
  has been 'cut off' (deriving from the verb 切る 'kiru', meaning 'to cut'). The event typically happens
  only once, and 「きり」 is best interpreted as 'ever since [action], nothing has changed' or 'only [action]
  occurred and has continued to be the case'. This often carries a nuance of something not having happened
  again or a state enduring longer than expected. While 「きり」 functions broadly across various registers,
  its more casual counterpart, 「っきり」, offers a similar meaning with a stronger sense of informality.

  - term: ままに
    meaning: As is, While remaining, Left in a state
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「きり」, 「ままに」 means 'as is' or 'while remaining' in a certain state, and does not necessarily
      imply a singular event leading to a lasting outcome; it focuses on the continuation of a state.
    grammar_point: 〜まま(に) (as is・unchanged)
  - term: たなり・なり
    meaning: While... ~ing, Remaining, Not or ever since, Keep or leave
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「きり」, which typically denotes a singular, definitive past action leading to a continuous
      state, 「たなり・なり」 describes a state of remaining or continuing without change, sometimes implying
      neglect or an unexpected outcome.
    grammar_point: たなり・なり (ever since・remaining)
  - term: 〜てから
    meaning: After doing X
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜てから」 simply indicates a chronological sequence, 'after doing X', without the emphasis on
      a singular, definitive event leading to an unchanging, often unintended or regretful, continuous
      state that 「きり」 conveys.
    grammar_point: てから (after and since)
  - term: 以来
    meaning: Since, Ever since
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「以来」 broadly means 'since' a certain time or event, marking a starting point for a subsequent
      period. In contrast, 「きり」 specifically implies a definitive, often singular, past event after which
      a state has persisted without further change, often with a sense of finality.
    grammar_point: 以来 (since・ever since)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「ままに」 and 「たなり・なり」 describe a state of remaining as is, they lack the
  'single event and enduring consequence' aspect that 「きり」 emphasizes. 「〜てから」 and 「以来」 are temporal markers
  indicating sequence or starting points, but 「きり」 specifically highlights the definitive, singular past
  event after which a state has persisted without further change, often with a sense of finality or an
  unexpected lack of subsequent action.
