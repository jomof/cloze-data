    "etymology": "「がてら」 is said to be a vocal change of 「がてり」, which originally comes from an abbreviation of the conjunctive form of 「糅(か)つ」, 「かて」 'to mix together', and 「あり」. So 「かてあり」 was abbreviated to 「かてり」, which then went through sound changes to 「がてり」 and 「がてら」. The nuance of 'being mixed together' is subtly retained in the modern usage.",
    "writeup": "「がてら」 is used similarly to an adverbial particle, connecting to the stem form of verbs or nouns. It translates to \"while (A), (B)\", \"during (A), (B)\", or \"on the occasion of (A)\". When (A) is a noun, it typically signifies physical movement.\n\nUnlike 「ながら」, 「がてら」 emphasizes that (A) presents a convenient opportunity to accomplish (B). It is more formal than 「ながら」.\n\n**Important Consideration:** Although 「がてら」 inherently implies doing two things, some Japanese speakers may use it similarly to 「ながら」. Therefore, be mindful of context.",
