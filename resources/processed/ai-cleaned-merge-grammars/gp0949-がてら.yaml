        "[Verb in 連用形] + がてら": "Indicates doing something else while performing a certain action or on a certain occasion.",
        "[Noun signifying physical movement] + がてら": "Indicates using a physical activity as an opportunity to do something else."
    },
    "jlpt": "N1",
    "meaning": "On the occasion of, While ... as well, While ... (one is) at it, During, Along the way",
    "meaning_warning": "Some Japanese speakers use it in a way similar to ながら, such as in ドライブがてら話し合った.",

        "part-of-speech": "phrase",

        "usage-context": "Formal, often used in written contexts or polite speech, emphasizing the primary action creating an opportunity for a secondary one."
    },
    "etymology": "がてら derives from がてり, which is an abbreviation of かてあり, combining the conjunctive form (連用形) of 糅つ (かてつ), meaning \"to mix together,\" and あり (ari, \"to exist\"). The progression from かてあり to かてり, then through sound changes to がてり and finally がてら, implies the blending or combining of two actions. This historical meaning of 'mixing together' subtly remains in the modern nuance, where one action is undertaken while another is 'mixed in' as an opportune side activity.",
    "writeup": "「がてら」 is used to describe a situation where one action is performed, and that action serves as an opportune moment or a convenient occasion to perform a secondary action. It typically connects to the conjunctive form (連用形) of verbs or to nouns that denote physical movement. For example, if you are going for a walk, you might use the opportunity to pick up groceries. Here, the walk is the primary action creating the context for the secondary action (grocery shopping).\n\nWhile 「がてら」 can be translated similarly to 「ながら」 (e.g., 'while doing A, also doing B'), there is a crucial difference. 「ながら」 emphasizes simultaneous actions, where both actions are happening concurrently. In contrast, 「がてら」 highlights that the first action provides a **convenient opportunity** to carry out the second action. The two actions are not necessarily happening in parallel but rather one leads naturally to the other, or one is a byproduct of the other. The primary action with 「がてら」 often involves movement or a specific occasion, leveraging that context to accomplish something else.\n\n「がてら」 is considered a more formal expression than similar grammar points and is often encountered in written language or more polished spoken Japanese.",
