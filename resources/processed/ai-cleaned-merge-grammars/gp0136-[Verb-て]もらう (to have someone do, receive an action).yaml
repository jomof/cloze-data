jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to express that the speaker, or someone the speaker empathizes with, receives a
    benefit from an action performed by another person. While the base form is casual, it is frequently
    used in polite contexts when receiving services or favors, often with polite suffixes.
  function: Indicates receiving a favor or benefit from someone's action.
  grammatical-role: Auxiliary verb following the te-form of another verb.
  logical-flow: Action performed by X for the benefit of Y, where Y is the speaker or someone in their
    in-group. Focuses on the recipient's perspective.
etymology: The grammar point 『Verb-て もらう』 is derived from the verb 『もらう』 (morau), meaning "to receive".
  When combined with the te-form of another verb, it retains this sense of receiving, but in the specific
  context of receiving the *action* of the preceding verb. Historically, the verb 『もらう』 comes from 古典日本語
  (Classical Japanese) 『まらう』 (marau), which had a similar meaning of receiving. This specific construction
  solidified over time to express the nuance of a received favor or service.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point **Verb-て もらう (te morau)** is used to express that someone does something for the speaker's benefit. It is attached to the te-form of a verb (V-て + もらう). This construction implies that the speaker is receiving a favor or a beneficial action from someone else. It can often be translated as "to have someone do something for you" or "to get someone to do something."

  **Key considerations:**
  *   **Beneficiary:** The primary beneficiary of the action is the speaker or someone within their inner circle (e.g., family, close friends).
  *   **Perspective:** The focus is on the recipient's perspective – the speaker acknowledges that they *received* a service or benefit.
  *   **Context:** It is widely used in daily conversation and business settings where a favor is exchanged or a service is rendered for one's benefit.

  Understanding the distinction between 『もらう』, 『くれる』, and 『あげる』 is fundamental. While 『もらう』 focuses on the speaker *receiving* a benefit, 『くれる』 emphasizes the giver's action of *giving* a benefit to the speaker, and 『あげる』 focuses on the speaker *giving* a benefit to someone else.
false_friends:
  - term: くれる
    meaning: To do something for the speaker or someone close to the speaker.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 『てもらう』 and 『てくれる』 indicate the speaker receives a benefit, 『てくれる』 emphasizes the
      *giver's* action, focusing on their act of giving to the speaker or the speaker's in-group. 『てもらう』
      emphasizes the *recipient's* gain or perspective of receiving the benefit.
    grammar_point: くれる (to give, inward to me・in-group)
  - term: あげる
    meaning: To do something for someone else (out-group).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 『てあげる』 implies that the speaker is doing something for someone else, and that person is of
      equal or lower status. The focus is on the *giver's* action for another. This contrasts with 『てもらう』,
      which focuses on the act of *receiving* for one's own benefit.
    grammar_point: あげる・やる (to give, outward)
  - term: いただく
    meaning: To humbly receive (an action or favor from a superior).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is the humble form of 『もらう』, used to show respect to the person performing the action.
      It's about humbly receiving a favor. While 『てもらう』 is more general, 『ていただく』 specifically emphasizes
      the speaker's humility when receiving an action from a higher-status individual.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:いただく (humbly receive favor)
  - term: 差し上げる
    meaning: To humbly do something for a superior.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is the humble form of 『あげる』, used when the speaker performs an action for someone of
      higher status. It's about humbly *giving* a favor, which is distinct from 『てもらう』 which is about
      *receiving* a favor.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:差し上げる (humbly give favor)
  - term: もらう
    meaning: To receive a thing.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While the standalone verb 『もらう』 means to receive a thing, 『てもらう』 specifically refers to receiving
      an *action* or a service. The presence of the て-form verb is key to this distinction.
    grammar_point: もらう (to receive)
  - term: てほしい
    meaning: To want someone to do something.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 『てほしい』 expresses a general desire for someone to do something. 『てもらう』 specifically means 'to
      receive the benefit of someone doing something,' focusing on the actual or intended receipt of the
      action.
    grammar_point: てほしい (I want you to)
  - term: ていただけませんか
    meaning: Could you please (humbly request)?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is a direct, humble *request* for someone to perform an action. 『てもらう』 describes the
      state of *receiving* an action, either as a past event or a planned one, not making a direct request.
    grammar_point: Verb[て]+いただけませんか (humble request)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 『てもらう』 focuses on receiving a benefit, 『てくれる』
  emphasizes someone giving a benefit to the speaker or their in-group, and 『てあげる』 describes the speaker
  giving a benefit to someone else. The perspective of who is doing the action and who is benefiting is
  key to choosing the appropriate expression. When dealing with hierarchical relationships, 『ていただく』 and
  『て差し上げる』 are the humble equivalents for receiving and giving actions, respectively.
