    "etymology": "The kanji 始 (shi, haji-) signifies \"to begin\" or \"to start.\" Its ancient form in Chinese characters depicted a woman (女) with a fetus or embryo (厶) inside, symbolizing birth or inception. This visual representation conveys the core concept of origin or the commencement of a process. The Japanese verb 始める (hajimeru) directly carries this meaning of initiation, particularly in a transitive sense (starting something).",
    "writeup": "The verb 「はじめる」 (hajimeru) is used to express that an action or a state is beginning. It functions as an auxiliary verb, attaching to the ます-stem of another verb. This combination creates a compound verb, indicating that the action described by the main verb is commencing. For example, 「読み始める」 (yomihajimeru) means \"to begin reading,\" and 「働き始める」 (hatarakihajimeru) means \"to begin working.\" An important point to remember is that 「はじめる」 is a **transitive** verb. This means it requires a direct object (or the preceding verb's action is the direct object) and is used when someone or something *initiates* an action. This contrasts with 「始まる」 (hajimaru), which is an **intransitive** verb and means \"to begin\" or \"to start\" when something *itself* begins without an explicit agent (e.g., 「授業が始まる」 - The class begins). Since 「はじめる」 is a verb, it can be conjugated for tense, politeness, negativity, and other grammatical forms. This allows for flexible expression of when an action starts (e.g., 「始めます」 - will start, 「始めた」 - started). Both the hiragana form 「はじめる」 and the kanji form 「始める」 are commonly used interchangeably without a change in nuance.",
