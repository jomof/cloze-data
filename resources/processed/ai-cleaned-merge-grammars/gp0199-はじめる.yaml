    "etymology": "The verb 「はじめる (hajimeru)」 itself comes from the noun 「はじめ (hajime)」, meaning \"beginning\" or \"start.\" The verb form evolved to express the action of initiating or starting something.",
    "writeup": "To express that actions are beginning, the verb 「**はじめる**」 (to commence) is used. \n\nTo say that (A) is starting/beginning, attach 「**はじめる**」 to the ます-stem of a verb. The use of either the hiragana form 「はじめる」 or the kanji form 「始める」 does not change the meaning or nuance.\n\nBecause 「**はじめる**」 is itself a verb, the tense can be changed to show that something will start, is starting, or has started.\n\nIt can be easy to accidentally use 「始まる」, the intransitive form of this verb. However, with this expression, the transitive form will always be used because the verb that 「**はじめる**」 is attached to is the thing that \"is started\" by \"something\" else.",
