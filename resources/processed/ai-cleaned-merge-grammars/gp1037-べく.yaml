    "etymology": "「べく」 is the conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb 「べし」. 「べし」 originates from the kanji 「可し」, meaning \"to be permissible.\" The underlying sense is that the action is being marked as a strong goal.",
    "writeup": "「べく」 is a formal grammatical structure derived from the classical auxiliary verb 「べし」. It attaches to the dictionary form of verbs to express the purpose or intention behind an action. The meaning is similar to \"in order to,\" \"for the purpose of,\" or \"to ensure that.\" Because it's derived from classical Japanese, 「べく」 is rarely used in everyday conversation and primarily appears in formal writing or speech. An important point is that 「べく」 attaches only to verbs that indicate intentional actions, where there's a conscious goal in mind.",
