        "usage-context": "Primarily used in formal written Japanese, official announcements, and speeches. It conveys a strong sense of purpose, determination, or obligation. It is considered stiff (硬い) and is rarely used in casual conversation.",

    },
    "etymology": "べく is derived from the conjunctive form of the classical auxiliary verb べし (beshi). This べし itself originated from the classical Japanese verb あり (ari), meaning 'to be,' combined with the suffix -べし (beshi), which indicated strong assertion, possibility, or obligation. The kanji 可し (beshi), meaning 'to be permissible' or 'possible,' became associated with it. In its modern usage, べく retains the underlying sense of a strong goal or intention, conveying a determined effort to achieve a specific purpose, often with a nuance of inevitability or strong resolve.",
    "writeup": "**べく (beku)** is a formal expression used to indicate purpose or intention, often translated as \"in order to,\" \"for the purpose of,\" or \"to ensure that.\" It attaches to the dictionary form of verbs that describe intentional actions, implying a strong will or clear objective behind the action. This grammatical structure carries a sense of determination, obligation, or deep commitment to achieving a goal, setting it apart from more general expressions of purpose.\n\nDue to its classical roots, べく lends a highly formal tone to sentences and is primarily found in written Japanese, formal speeches, official documents, or news reports. It is rarely used in everyday spoken Japanese.\n\n### Usage with する (to do)\nWhen connecting with the verb する (to do), べく can take two forms:\n\n*   **すべく (subeku)**: This is the classical conjugation, reflecting the original form of べし. It is still considered grammatically correct and is common in very formal contexts.\n*   **するべく (surubeku)**: This is a more modern and increasingly common form. Both forms are accepted and used in contemporary formal Japanese.\n\n### Nuance and Emphasis\nWhile べく expresses purpose, it carries a stronger emphasis on the intentionality and significance of the goal than other particles. It often implies that the action taken is a resolute and necessary step towards achieving a specific, often challenging, objective. The underlying meaning can be thought of as ",
