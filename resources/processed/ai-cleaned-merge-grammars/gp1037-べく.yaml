    "writeup": "**べく (beku)** is a formal expression used to indicate purpose or intention, similar to \"in order to\" or \"for the purpose of.\" It is derived from the classical auxiliary verb べし. Because of its classical roots, it adds a sense of formality and determination to the statement. It's important to note that べく attaches to verbs that express intentional actions. When using べく with する, it becomes すべく, although するべく is also accepted in modern Japanese. Because of its formality, you'll find べく more often in written Japanese, formal speeches, or official announcements than in everyday conversation. The nuance it adds is one of striving towards a goal or fulfilling an obligation.",
