    "etymology": "The 「〜て」 form originates from the 連用形 (ren'yōkei, continuative form) of verbs and い-adjectives, historically used to connect clauses. It evolved to indicate a sequence of actions, reasons, or states, linking them together in a cohesive manner. The 「〜で」 form, used with な-adjectives and nouns, is derived from the て-form of the copula 「だ」, signifying a state or condition that precedes the following clause. This derivation is essential for understanding why nouns and な-adjectives behave similarly here.",
    "writeup": "The 「〜て」 form is a fundamental grammatical construction in Japanese used to connect clauses, functioning in ways similar to \"and\" or \"because\" in English. While the grammar point's title refers to \"Adjective[て]\", its application extends to both い-adjectives and な-adjectives, as well as nouns. It is a very common and versatile grammatical form used across all registers of Japanese, from casual conversations to formal writing.\n\n**Formation Rules:**\n*   **For い-adjectives:** Drop the final 「い」 and attach 「くて」. For example, 「新しい」 becomes 「新しくて」. A notable exception is 「いい」 (good), which irregularly becomes 「よくて」, not 「いくて」.\n*   **For な-adjectives and Nouns:** Attach 「で」 directly. For example, 「静かだ」 becomes 「静かで」, and 「学生だ」 becomes 「学生で」. This 「で」 is actually the te-form of the copula 「だ」, indicating a preceding state or condition.\n\n**Core Meanings and Usage:**\n\n1.  **Linking (And):** This is the most common and straightforward use, joining two attributes, states, or consecutive actions. The connected clauses usually describe qualities of the same subject or closely related events in sequence.\n    *   Example: 「この本は**新しくて面白い**。」(This book is new and interesting.)\n\n2.  **Reasons/Causes (Because):** The first clause, ending in 「〜くて」 or 「〜で」, acts as a reason or cause for the state or action described in the second clause. This usage implies a direct causal relationship between the two parts.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **Context is Key:** The precise meaning (linking vs. reason) is heavily dependent on the context and the logical relationship between the two clauses.\n*   **Implied \"Manner\":** While not a direct primary meaning for adjectives like it is for verbs, the te-form can sometimes indirectly suggest the manner in which an action occurs if the adjective describes a state influencing that action. However, for adjectives, this is less explicit than with verbal te-forms.",
