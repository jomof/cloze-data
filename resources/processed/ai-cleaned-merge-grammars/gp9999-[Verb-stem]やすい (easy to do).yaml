jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: casual
  function: Expresses feasibility, inherent nature, or tendency of an action.
  nuance: 〜やすい implies something is easy or prone to happen. 〜にくい implies difficulty or resistance to
    happening. Often used for objective assessments, but can also convey personal experience.
  grammatical-role: Functions adjectivally to modify nouns or predicatively to describe the ease/difficulty
    of a verb's action.
etymology: 「やすい」 (易い) comes from 易しい (やさしい), meaning "easy" or "gentle," implying "easy to handle" or
  "easily done." 「にくい」 (難い) comes from 難い (かたい/がたい), meaning "hard" or "difficult," implying "difficult
  to do" or "hard to accomplish." These affixes attach to verb stems, extending the meaning of ease or
  difficulty directly to the action itself.
writeup: |-
  〜やすい and 〜にくい are auxiliary adjectives that attach to the stem form of verbs to express the ease or difficulty of performing an action. They behave grammatically just like い-adjectives.

  When using 〜やすい, it indicates that the action is easy to perform, or that something is prone to happen. For example, a pen that writes smoothly is "書きやすい" (kaki-yasui, easy to write with). A mistake that happens often might be described as "間違いやすい" (machigai-yasui, easy to make a mistake, or prone to mistakes). It can also describe a tendency, like someone who is "怒りやすい" (okori-yasui, easily angered).

  Conversely, 〜にくい signifies that an action is difficult to perform, or that something is resistant to happening. A dish that is hard to eat might be "食べにくい" (tabe-nikui, difficult to eat). A problem that is hard to solve is "解きにくい" (toki-nikui, difficult to solve). It can also indicate resistance or an unpleasant nature, such as a texture that is "飲みにくい" (nomi-nikui, difficult to drink, or unpleasant to drink).

  These expressions often describe inherent qualities or objective properties of the subject or object involved in the action. They are widely used in both casual and formal Japanese.

  - term: Verb[dictionary] + ことができる
    meaning: can do, be able to do
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「〜ことができる」 indicates the ability or permission to do something. 「〜やすい」 and 「〜にくい」 describe
      the ease or difficulty of an action, often an inherent quality. For example, 「この本は読{みやすい}です」 (This
      book is easy to read) describes the book's readability, whereas 「この本は読む{ことができる}」 (I can read this
      book) describes one's ability to read it.
    grammar_point: することができる (can・be able to)
  - term: Verb[stem] + がたい
    meaning: hard to do, difficult to do (often emotionally or morally)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜がたい」 also expresses difficulty, but it often carries a stronger nuance of emotional or moral
      difficulty, or that something is almost impossible or extremely hard. It is more formal and less
      common than 「〜にくい」. For example, 「信じ{がたい}話」 (a hard-to-believe story) versus 「読{みにくい}字」 (hard-to-read
      handwriting). 「〜がたい」 suggests that the action is difficult due to internal resistance or a high
      degree of impossibility, while 「〜にくい」 can refer to practical or objective difficulty.
    grammar_point: がたい (hard to do)
  - term: Verb[stem] + づらい
    meaning: difficult to do, hard to do (often physically or emotionally unpleasant)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜づらい」 is very similar to 「〜にくい」, but it tends to be used when the difficulty causes some
      form of unpleasantness or discomfort for the doer, either physically or mentally. For example, 「この椅子は座{りづらい}」
      (This chair is difficult/uncomfortable to sit on). While 「〜にくい」 can also imply discomfort, 「〜づらい」
      emphasizes the unpleasant aspect more directly.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[stem] + づらい (difficult to do, unpleasant)
  - term: Verb[stem] + そう
    meaning: looks like, seems like (from appearance)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「〜そう」 (looks like) expresses that something appears easy or difficult based on observation.
      「〜やすい」 and 「〜にくい」 state that something is easy or difficult. For example, 「この問題は簡単そうですね」 (This problem
      looks easy, doesn't it?) vs. 「この問題は解き{やすい}です」 (This problem is easy to solve).
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]・[い-Adjective-stem]・[な-Adjective]そうだ (it seems・looks like)'
post_false_friends_writeup: While 〜やすい and 〜にくい describe the inherent ease or difficulty of an action,
  other expressions convey similar ideas with different nuances. 〜ることができる refers to physical ability or
  permission. 〜がたい expresses a high degree of difficulty, often emotional or moral, making an action almost
  impossible. 〜づらい emphasizes that the difficulty causes discomfort or unpleasantness. Lastly, 〜そう indicates
  a superficial judgment based on appearance rather than an inherent quality. Understanding these distinctions
  is crucial for accurate and natural expression.

  the nuance of ease, difficulty, or inclination.
