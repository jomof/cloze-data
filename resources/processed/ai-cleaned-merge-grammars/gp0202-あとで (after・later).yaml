jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Used to describe an action or event that occurs subsequent to another action or event.
  function: Connects two events in a temporal sequence.
  nuance: Implies that the second event occurs sometime after the first, not necessarily immediately.
    Can also simply mean 'later' in a general sense.
  grammatical-role: adverbial phrase
  temporal-flow: Indicates a sequence where one event precedes another, with a potential time gap.
  spatial-flow: Implies a progression through time rather than space.
etymology: 「あとで」 is formed from the noun 「後 (ato)」, meaning 'behind' or 'after', and the particle 「で (de)」,
  which indicates a state or a point in time/space. Historically, 「後」 refers to the physical 'back' or
  'rear' of something. Its temporal meaning of 'after' likely evolved from the idea of something following
  behind another in sequence. The particle 「で」 serves to specify the condition or time at which the action
  in the main clause takes place, effectively meaning 'at the point of being after' or 'in the state of
  what follows'.
writeup: 「あとで」 means "after" or "later" and is used to connect two events or actions, indicating that
  the second event occurs subsequent to the first. It can be attached to the plain past tense of a verb
  (e.g., 食べたあとで - *after eating*) or a noun followed by the particle 「の」 (e.g., 仕事のあとで - *after work*).
  A key nuance of 「あとで」 is that the second action doesn't necessarily happen immediately after the first.
  There can be a flexible time gap between the two events. This distinguishes it from expressions like
  「～てから」, which often implies a more immediate or direct succession. Additionally, 「あとで」 can be used adverbially
  at the beginning of a sentence (or standing alone) to mean "later" in a general sense, referring to
  an unspecified future time relative to the present moment. For example, 「あとで電話します」 means "I'll call
  you later."

  - term: まえに
    meaning: Before, In front of
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「あとで」 which indicates something happens *after*, 「まえに」 indicates something happens
      *before*.
    grammar_point: まえに (before・in front)
  - term: てから
    meaning: Once...is done, Once...happens, After doing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「てから」 often implies a more direct and immediate sequence of events than 「あとで」. While both
      indicate sequence, 「てから」 can emphasize the completion of the prior action as a prerequisite for
      the next.
    grammar_point: てから (after and since)
  - term: たら
    meaning: When, From when, Just when, If
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たら」 indicates a condition or a hypothetical situation and isn't as direct as 「あとで」 in denoting
      a simple temporal sequence of events. It focuses on the result of a completed action as a trigger
      for the next.
    grammar_point: たら (if・when・after)
  - term: 上で
    meaning: After, Upon
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「上で」 often carries a nuance of preparation or making a decision after considering something,
      implying a deliberate step or prerequisite, whereas 「あとで」 is a more general statement about sequence
      without this implication.
    grammar_point: 上で (after doing)
  - term: 後ほど
    meaning: Later (more formal)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「後ほど」 is a more formal and polite way to say "later" compared to 「あとで」. While both indicate
      a future time, 「後ほど」 is typically used in business or respectful contexts, suggesting a slightly
      less immediate but certain follow-up.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:後ほど (later, more formal)
  - term: たばかり
    meaning: Just did
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たばかり」 emphasizes that an action has *just* been completed, implying a very short interval
      or immediate past, whereas 「あとで」 simply denotes a temporal sequence with a potentially longer or
      unspecified gap.
    grammar_point: たばかり (just did)
  - term: ているあいだに
    meaning: While something is happening
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「あとで」 specifies an action occurring *after* another, while 「ているあいだに」 describes an action occurring
      *during* another ongoing action, emphasizing simultaneity or an event occurring within a continuous
      period.
    grammar_point: ているあいだに (while something is happening)
  - term: てからというもの
    meaning: Lasting change since
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both indicate a sequence, 「てからというもの」 specifically implies that a significant change
      or lasting state has occurred *since* the first event and has continued, often with a strong cause-and-effect
      feel for the subsequent situation. 「あとで」 is a simple "after" without this lasting consequence or
      emphasis.
    grammar_point: てからというもの (lasting change since)
  - term: 以来
    meaning: Since, Ever since
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「以来」 means "since then" and implies a continuous state or action that has been ongoing *from*
      a specific point in time up to the present, unlike 「あとで」 which simply indicates a subsequent event
      without implying continuation.
    grammar_point: 以来 (since・ever since)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「あとで」, 「てから」, 「たら」, 「上で」, 「後ほど」, 「たばかり」, 「ているあいだに」, 「てからというもの」, and
  「以来」 all relate to events happening in sequence or at a particular time, it is crucial to distinguish
  their nuances. Use 「あとで」 for general "after" statements, indicating a subsequent event without necessarily
  implying immediate succession. Use 「てから」 for closer sequences or to emphasize the completion of a previous
  action as a prerequisite for the next. Use 「たら」 for hypothetical or conditional situations. Use 「上で」
  when something is done or decided based on careful consideration or completion of a prior step. Use
  「後ほど」 for a more formal or polite expression of "later." 「たばかり」 emphasizes the very recent completion
  of an action. 「ているあいだに」 indicates an event happening *during* another. 「てからというもの」 implies a lasting
  change *since* a particular event. 「以来」 denotes continuation *from* a past point in time.

          a simple 'after'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ご飯 を 食べ た 上 で、少し だけ 一緒 に いよう か？
        english: After eating (and considering something), shall we spend a little time together?
        hint: This implies deliberation or a decision made after eating, which is not the nuance here.
          We're looking for a simple temporal connection.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ご飯 が 終わっ て、少し だけ 一緒 に いよう か？
        english: After the meal is over, shall we spend a little time together?
        hint: This focuses on the completion of the meal, while the original is a broader temporal connection.
          We're looking for a broader 'after'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ご飯 を 食べ て すぐ に、少し だけ 一緒 に いよう か？
        english: Immediately after eating, shall we spend a little time together?
        hint: This emphasizes immediate action, while the original allows for a slight time gap. We're
          looking for an expression that allows for a time gap.
    scene: A woman inviting her male partner to relax together after a meal.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The ending 「～ようか」 is a soft invitation, commonly used in casual and intimate settings. While
      not exclusively female, when a woman uses it towards a male partner in an intimate context, it can
      convey a gentle, inviting tone. The choice of 「いようか」 (let's be/stay) instead of 「いましょうか」 (polite)
      is typical in close relationships.
post_example_writeup: The flexibility of 「あとで」 is its key feature. It allows for a natural flow of conversation
  when discussing subsequent events without needing to specify the exact timing or the reason for the
  delay. This makes it very versatile in everyday Japanese. Pay close attention to context when deciding
  between 「あとで」 and other similar expressions like 「てから」 or 「たら」.
