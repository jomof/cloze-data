pronunciation:
  katakana: キニイル
  romaji: ki ni iru
formation:
  '[Object/Thing が] + [Person に (optional)] + 気に入る': Used when an object or thing enters a person's favor
    or spirit, making them pleased with it.
  '[Person は] + [Object/Thing が] + 気に入る': Used when the person is the topic, and the object/thing is what
    they've come to like or are pleased with.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The expression combines 「気 (ki)」, meaning 'spirit, mind, feeling, mood,' with the particle
  「に (ni)」, indicating a target or direction, and the verb 「入る (hairu)」, meaning 'to enter.' Thus, 「気に入る
  (ki ni iru)」 literally translates to 'to enter one's spirit/mind,' conveying the nuance of something
  being accepted or welcomed into one's favor, hence 'to become fond of' or 'to take a liking to'.
writeup: |-
  「気に入る (ki ni iru)」 is a common Japanese expression used to convey that someone has developed a liking or fondness for something or someone. It implies a process where something has 'entered' one's favor or spirit, leading to approval or pleasure. It's about finding satisfaction in a specific thing or situation, often implying a choice or decision after consideration. For example, if you're trying on clothes, looking at a new apartment, or being introduced to a new idea, 「気に入る」 is the natural expression to use when you find it agreeable.

  This phrase is often used when you encounter something new, or something that you've been evaluating, and it meets your approval or brings you satisfaction. It's distinct from simply saying 「好きだ (suki da)」, which expresses a general or static liking. While 「好きだ」 indicates a state of liking something in general (e.g., 'I like apples' - 「リンゴが好きだ」), 「気に入る」 emphasizes the *action* or *process* of coming to like something specific or being pleased with it in a particular instance (e.g., 'I liked this specific apple' - 「このリンゴが気に入った」).

  Therefore, 「気に入る」 often carries a nuance of 'to be pleased with,' 'to approve of,' or 'to find something appealing.' The subject of 「気に入る」 is typically the thing or person that is liked (marked with が), and the person experiencing the liking is often marked with に (when explicitly stated) or functions as the topic with は.
false_friends:
  - term: 好きだ
    meaning: to like (static preference)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「好きだ」 expresses a static, general liking or preference. It describes an enduring state. 「気に入る」
      describes the *process* of developing a liking for something, or a specific instance of finding
      something appealing after a certain experience or consideration. For example, "I like dogs" (「犬が好きだ」)
      is a general preference, while "I liked this dog I just met" (「この犬が気に入った」) implies a specific encounter.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:'[Noun]が好きだ (to like)'
  - term: 好む
    meaning: to prefer; to like (formal, transitive)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「好む」 is a more formal and transitive verb for liking or preferring. It's often used in writing,
      formal speeches, or when describing general preferences or tastes in a more elevated tone. 「気に入る」
      is more commonly used in everyday conversation and refers to a specific item or instance that has
      gained one's approval or favor.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:好む (to prefer・to like)
  - term: 良いと思う
    meaning: to think it's good; to consider it good
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「良いと思う」 expresses an opinion that something is good, possibly from an objective or evaluative
      standpoint. While 「気に入る」 also involves evaluation, it specifically conveys a personal feeling of
      approval or fondness that goes beyond mere objective goodness. One might 「良いと思う」 (think something
      is good) without it necessarily 「気に入る」 (entering their personal favor).
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:良いと思う (to think something is good)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing 「気に入る」 with 「好きだ」 or 「好む」, remember that 「気に入る」 highlights
  the moment or process something becomes appealing to you. It's about finding satisfaction in a specific
  thing or situation, often implying a choice or decision after consideration. 「好きだ」 is a broader, more
  general statement of preference, while 「好む」 is its more formal counterpart. When evaluating an item
  or experience, and you decide you like it, 「気に入る」 is often the precise term to use. 「良いと思う」 simply states
  an opinion of goodness, which may or may not translate to a personal fondness.

  to an ongoing state of satisfaction.
