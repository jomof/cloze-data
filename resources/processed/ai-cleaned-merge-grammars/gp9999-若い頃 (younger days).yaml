  romaji: wakai koro
formation:
  い-Adjective[若い] + 頃: Refers to a past period when one was young.
  若い + 時: Can also be used with 時, meaning 'young time' or 'when young'.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The phrase combines the い-adjective 若い (wakai), meaning 'young,' with the noun 頃 (koro), which
  refers to a 'time' or 'period.' Together, they literally mean 'young time' or 'young period,' denoting
  a specific stage in one's past life. The concept of 頃 for 'time' can also be seen in expressions like
  いつ頃 (itsugoro - around when) or あの頃 (anokoro - that time).
writeup: |-
  「若い頃」(wakai koro) is a common phrase used to refer to the period of one's youth or younger days. It is generally used to speak about a time in the past when the speaker or the subject was young, typically from adolescence through early adulthood. This phrase often carries a nostalgic or reflective tone, as it naturally contrasts with the present.

  While grammatically straightforward, combining the adjective 若い (young) with the noun 頃 (time/period), its usage implies a completed phase of life. It's frequently used when recounting memories, comparing past self to present self, or describing events that occurred during that specific life stage.

  It is a gender-neutral term and can be used by speakers of any age when reminiscing about their past.

  - term: 青春
    meaning: youth, springtime of life
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「青春」(seishun) carries a strong emotional and often nostalgic nuance, emphasizing the vitality,
      passion, and idealism of one's youth. It's more poetic and evokes a sense of 'the best years of
      one's life.' In contrast, 「若い頃」is a neutral term simply referring to the period when one was young,
      without necessarily implying a heightened emotional state or peak of life.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:青春 (youth・springtime of life)
  - term: 子供の頃
    meaning: childhood
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「子供の頃」(kodomo no koro) specifically refers to the period of one's childhood (typically before
      adolescence), when one was literally a 'child.' 「若い頃」refers to a slightly later period, generally
      encompassing adolescence and early adulthood, when one is 'young' but no longer a 'child' in the
      strict sense.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:子供の頃 (childhood)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「若い頃」, 「青春」, and 「子供の頃」all refer to past periods of life, they highlight
  different aspects. 「若い頃」is a neutral descriptor of a time when one was young. 「青春」emphasizes the vibrant,
  emotional peak of youth, often used in a more idealized sense. 「子供の頃」is strictly about one's time as
  a child.
