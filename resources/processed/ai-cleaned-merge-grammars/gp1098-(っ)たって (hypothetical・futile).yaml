details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used in conversation to express a hypothetical or futile situation.
  function: Implies that the speaker believes the action is unlikely to succeed or is pointless.
  nuance: Often used to express a sense of futility or to downplay the significance of a statement. It
    is a contracted form of 「と言ったって」 or 「としても」. It often expresses frustration that something won't work,
    even if it seems like it should.
etymology: （っ）たって derives from the combination of 「と」 (a particle indicating content or condition), 「言った」
  (the past tense of 「言う」, meaning "to say"), and 「って」 (a colloquial particle emphasizing the preceding
  word or phrase). The construction implies something is said or assumed to be true, but the speaker doubts
  its significance or practicality.
writeup: （っ）たって is a conversational grammar point used to express that even if a certain condition is
  true, it doesn't change the outcome or the speaker's opinion. It's often used to express a sense of
  futility or to downplay the significance of a statement. It is a contracted form of 「と言ったって」 or 「としても」.
  You will often hear it used to express frustration that something won't work, even if it seems like
  it should. This grammar is informal and typically used in casual conversations.
false_friends:
  - term: と言っても
    meaning: although I say. even if I say
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both (っ)たって and と言っても express a sense of qualification, (っ)たって often implies a sense
      of futility or resignation that と言っても does not always carry. (っ)たって is a colloquial contraction
      of と言っても.
    grammar_point: と言っても (having said that)
  - term: としても
    meaning: even if. granting that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: としても is more formal and less emphatic than (っ)たって, which is a contraction. The key difference
      is the implied futility in (っ)たって, suggesting the condition doesn't change the ultimate outcome.
    grammar_point: としても (even if assumed)
  - term: ～ても
    meaning: even if. even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～ても」 expresses a general concession or condition. While it can overlap in meaning with 「(っ)たって」,
      「(っ)たって」 carries a stronger nuance of futility, resignation, or a sense that something is pointless
      despite the condition, which 「～ても」 does not inherently imply.
    grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
  - term: たところで
    meaning: even if. even though. no matter how much
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both (っ)たって and たところで express futility, たところで directly emphasizes the negative or useless
      outcome of an action, implying that doing it is pointless. (っ)たって, on the other hand, often dismisses
      a stated condition or argument as irrelevant to the outcome, implying 'even if you say X, Y'.
    grammar_point: たところで (even if futile)
post_false_friends_writeup: While both と言っても and としても share a similar meaning with (っ)たって, (っ)たって carries
  a stronger connotation of futility or resignation. と言っても is a more general way of making a qualification
  or concession, while としても simply acknowledges a possibility without necessarily expressing a sense of
  futility. 「～ても」 also expresses a general concession, but lacks the strong emphasis on futility found
  in (っ)たって. Additionally, たところで focuses on the direct uselessness of an action, implying it will lead
  to no positive result, whereas (っ)たって dismisses the premise or argument itself as irrelevant to the
  actual outcome.
examples:
  - english: Even if you try to do your best from tomorrow, it's meaningless if you don't start today.
    japanese:
      - 明日 から 頑張ろう {ったって}、今日 から 始め ない と 意味 ない よ。
      - 明日 から 頑張ろう {ったって}、今日 から 始め なきゃ 意味 が ない ん だ。
      - 明日 から 頑張ろう {ったって}、今 やら なきゃ 意味 無い ぜ。
    english_literally: Even if you say you'll do your best from tomorrow, if you don't start from today,
      it's meaningless, you know.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 から 頑張ろう と し て も、今日 から 始め ない と 意味 ない よ。
        english: Even if you try to do your best from tomorrow, it's meaningless if you don't start today.
        hint: 「としても」 is more formal and general, without the strong futility or resignation implied by
          「(っ)たって」. We're looking for a casual, more emphatic expression of futility.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 から 頑張っ て も、今日 から 始め ない と 意味 ない よ。
        english: Even if you do your best from tomorrow, it's meaningless if you don't start today.
        hint: 「～ても」 expresses a general concession. While similar, it lacks the specific nuance of futility
          or resignation that 「(っ)たって」 conveys, especially when referring to something you *try* to do.
    scene: A friend is procrastinating on a task, always saying they'll start tomorrow, but never actually
      begins.
    register: casual
    setting: instructional
    nuance: The casual 「～よ」 at the end emphasizes the speaker's direct advice, implying that while the
      listener's intent 「頑張ろう」 is noted, it is ultimately futile without present action. This is a common
      phrase to gently push someone towards action.
    etymology: The phrase 「頑張ろう」 is the volitional form of 「頑張る」 (to do one's best/persevere). The construction
      expresses a future intent or proposal, which then gets negated by the futility implied by 「(っ)たって」.
  - english: Even if he objects, this plan cannot be changed.
    japanese:
      - 彼 が 反対 する {ったって}、この 計画 は 変更 でき ない ん だ。
      - 彼 が 反対 する {ったって}、この 計画 は 変わら ない よ。
      - 彼 が 反対 する {ったって}、どうせ 決定 事項 です から。
    english_literally: Even if he objects, this plan cannot be changed.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が 反対 し て も、この 計画 は 変更 でき ない ん だ。
        english: Even if he objects, this plan cannot be changed.
        hint: 「～ても」 indicates a general 'even if'. 「(っ)たって」 adds a stronger sense of dismissal or futility,
          emphasizing that his objection is not going to change anything. We're looking for that stronger
          dismissal.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が 反対 する と 言っ て も、この 計画 は 変更 でき ない ん だ。
        english: Even if he objects, this plan cannot be changed.
        hint: 「と言っても」 is a more direct way of saying 'even if one says' but doesn't carry the same casual,
          somewhat exasperated futility as 「(っ)たって」. We want the casual, dismissive tone.
    scene: Colleagues are discussing a project, and one expresses concern about a difficult team member
      who is known to oppose new ideas.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The use of 「～ん だ」 indicates the speaker's explanation or emphasis on an underlying truth,
      reinforcing the finality of the decision. This phrasing is common in professional settings when
      a decision has been made and is non-negotiable.
    etymology: The auxiliary 「ん だ」 is a colloquial contraction of 「の だ」, which adds explanatory or emphatic
      nuance, often indicating a shared understanding or a reason for a statement.
  - english: Even if I was late, it's a problem if you don't listen to my reason.
    japanese:
      - 遅刻 し た {ったって}、理由 を 聞い て もらえ ない と 困る よ。
      - 遅刻 し た {ったって}、言い訳 くらい 聞い て くれ ない と。
      - 遅刻 し た {ったって}、一方 的 に 責める の は 違う と 思う な。
    english_literally: Even if I was late, it's troublesome if you don't listen to my reason, you know.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 遅刻 し て も、理由 を 聞い て もらえ ない と 困る よ。
        english: Even if I was late, it's a problem if you don't listen to my reason.
        hint: While 「～ても」 works generally for 'even if', 「(っ)たって」 here implies a mild frustration or a
          sense that 'being late' is being dismissed without considering the reason, giving it a stronger
          emotional undertone. We're looking for that frustrated nuance.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 遅刻 し た に し て も、理由 を 聞い て もらえ ない と 困る よ。
        english: Even if I was late, it's a problem if you don't listen to my reason.
        hint: 「にしても」 acknowledges a fact but is more formal and less conversational than 「(っ)たって」. It
          doesn't carry the same personal, slightly exasperated nuance. We need the casual, personal tone.
    scene: A student trying to explain to a strict teacher why they were late for class, feeling frustrated
      that they are being shut down.
    register: casual
    setting: apologetic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The phrase 「～と 困る」 expresses a dilemma or trouble caused by the listener's action (or inaction).
      The casual 「～よ」 suggests a personal appeal or complaint, common among younger speakers expressing
      frustration.
    etymology: 「～てもらう」 is a passive voice construction meaning 'to receive the favor of someone doing
      something'. In this case, 「聞いてもらえない」 means 'cannot receive the favor of being listened to', indicating
      frustration at the lack of consideration.
  - english: Even if this job is difficult, we can't just give up, can we?
    japanese:
      - この 仕事 は 難しい {ったって}、諦める わけ に は いか ない だろう。
      - この 仕事 が 難しい {ったって}、放り出す わけ に は いか ない よ ね。
      - た と え 難しく {ったって}、投げ出す わけ に は いか ない さ。
    english_literally: Even if this job is difficult, it's not the reason to give up, is it?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 仕事 は 難しく て も、諦める わけ に は いか ない だろう。
        english: Even if this job is difficult, we can't just give up, can we?
        hint: 「～ても」 expresses a simple concession. 「(っ)たって」 adds a nuance of acknowledging the difficulty
          but immediately dismissing it as a reason to stop, implying a stronger resolve despite the challenge.
          We're looking for that resolute nuance.
      - competing_japanese:
          - た と え この 仕事 が 難しく て も、諦める わけ に は いか ない だろう。
        english: Even if this job were difficult, we can't just give up, can we?
        hint: 「たとえ～ても」 emphasizes a hypothetical or extreme condition, but it doesn't carry the colloquial,
          slightly exasperated acknowledgement of a fact followed by a strong dismissal like 「(っ)たって」.
          We need the conversational tone.
    scene: A team facing a challenging project with many obstacles, and the team leader motivates them
      to persevere.
    register: formal
    setting: inspirational
    nuance: The phrase 「～わけ には いかない」 indicates that something is impossible or unacceptable, often due
      to social obligation or internal resolve. The use of 「～だろう」 softens the directness slightly, inviting
      agreement rather than issuing a blunt command, suitable for a leader.
    etymology: 「わけ には いかない」 literally translates to 'it is not a reason to go'. It implies that there
      is no valid reason or justification to do something, often due to moral, social, or logical constraints.
  - english: Even if it was fun back then, the situation is different now, you know.
    japanese:
      - あの 時 は 楽しかっ た {ったって}、今 と は 違う 状況 だ から ね。
      - 昔 は 楽しかっ た {ったって}、もう 今 は 無理 な ん だ よ。
      - 昔 は 楽しかっ た {ったって}、もう 同じ 経験 は でき ない さ。
    english_literally: Even if it was fun back then, because the situation is different now, you know.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 時 は 楽しく て も、今 と は 違う 状況 だ から ね。
        english: Even if it was fun back then, the situation is different now, you know.
        hint: 「～ても」 offers a general concession. 「(っ)たって」 here highlights the speaker's resignation that
          despite how fun it was, it's futile to try to recreate it exactly because circumstances have
          changed. We want that sense of resignation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 時 は 楽しかっ た けれど、今 と は 違う 状況 だ から ね。
        english: It was fun back then, but the situation is different now, you know.
        hint: 「～けれど」 is a simple conjunction meaning 'but' or 'although'. While it contrasts, it lacks
          the specific nuance of 'even if that were true, it's still futile/different' that 「(っ)たって」 conveys.
          We need the 'even if' meaning.
    scene: Friends reminiscing about old times, suggesting they recreate a past event, but one friend
      points out that circumstances have changed.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The ending 「～から ね」 is a common casual way to explain a reason or give a gentle reminder. The
      contrast between past enjoyment 「楽しかった」 and current reality 「違う 状況」 highlights the speaker's resignation
      that the past cannot be perfectly recreated, a common reflection for older individuals.
    etymology: The conjunction 「だから」 is a causal linker meaning 'therefore' or 'because'. In casual speech,
      it often contracts to 「だから ね」 or 「から ね」, which adds a nuance of mild explanation or seeking agreement,
      making the statement sound less assertive.
  - english: Even if he's kind, there might be a hidden agenda.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 親切 {だ って}、裏 が ある か も しれ ない よ。
      - 彼 が 親切 {だ って}、信用 し すぎる の は 危ない よ。
      - 彼 が 親切 {だ って}、警戒 する に 越し た こと は ない さ。
    english_literally: Even if he is kind, there might be a hidden agenda, you know.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 親切 で も、裏 が ある か も しれ ない よ。
        english: Even if he's kind, there might be a hidden agenda.
        hint: 「～ても」 provides a general 'even if' for adjectives and nouns. 「(っ)たって」 here suggests a stronger,
          more suspicious 'even if that's true, I still doubt it', conveying a dismissive tone towards
          the apparent kindness. We're looking for that dismissive, cautious tone.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 親切 と 言っ て も、裏 が ある か も しれ ない よ。
        english: Even if he's kind (as people say), there might be a hidden agenda.
        hint: 「と言っても」 implies 'even if it is said that'. While similar, 「(っ)たって」 is more direct and less
          formal, and carries a nuance of personal doubt or suspicion more strongly than merely stating
          a common opinion. We need the more personal, casual doubt.
    scene: Two people discussing a new acquaintance who seems almost too good to be true, leading to suspicion.
    register: casual
    setting: cautious
    nuance: The phrase 「裏 が ある」 (lit. "there's a back") means there's a hidden motive or agenda, conveying
      suspicion. The casual 「～よ」 and 「～かも しれない」 express a speculative warning, fitting for a casual conversation
      about a potentially untrust trustworthy person.
    etymology: The expression 「裏 が ある」 is an idiom meaning 'there is a hidden motive/agenda/trick'. 「裏」
      literally means 'back' or 'reverse side', and the idiom implies that there's something hidden behind
      the surface appearance.
  - english: Even if someone is a doctor, they're human, so they're not perfect.
    japanese:
      - 医者 {だ って}、人間 だ から 完璧 じゃ ない よ。
      - 医者 {だ って}、ミス も する ん だ よ。
      - 医者 {だ って}、間違う こと も ある ん だ から。
    english_literally: Even if someone is a doctor, because they are human, they are not perfect, you
      know.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 医者 で も、人間 だ から 完璧 じゃ ない よ。
        english: Even if someone is a doctor, they're human, so they're not perfect.
        hint: 「～ても」 provides a general concession. 「(っ)たって」 here emphasizes the futility of expecting
          perfection, highlighting that being a doctor doesn't exempt one from human fallibility. We want
          that emphasis on the futility of expectation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 医者 と は いえ、人間 だ から 完璧 じゃ ない よ。
        english: Though one may be a doctor, they're human, so they're not perfect.
        hint: 「とはいえ」 means 'though that said' or 'it is true that... but'. It offers a concession but
          is more formal and less direct than 「(っ)たって」, which carries a more casual, dismissive tone toward
          the idea of perfection. We need the conversational, dismissive nuance.
    scene: Someone is overly critical of a doctor's mistake, and another person reminds them that doctors
      are also fallible humans.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The casual 「～よ」 adds a friendly, advising tone. The common phrase 「人間 だ から」 (because they're
      human) reinforces the universal truth. This example demonstrates how 「(っ)たって」 can be used to temper
      overly high expectations by pointing out a fundamental, unchangeable reality.
    etymology: The phrase 「完璧 じゃ ない」 means 'not perfect'. 「完璧」 is a noun meaning 'perfection', and 「じゃ
      ない」 is the casual negative form of the copula 「です/だ」. This construction is a common way to express
      imperfection or lack of something.
  - english: Even if you try to convince him, he probably won't listen.
    japanese:
      - 彼 を 説得 しよう {ったって}、多分 聞き入れ ない だろう な。
      - 彼 を 説得 しよう {と し たって}、無駄 だ と 思う よ。
      - あいつ を 説得 しよう {ったって}、聞く 耳 持た ない だろう な。

          - 彼 を 説得 しよう と し て も、多分 聞き入れ ない だろう な。
        english: Even if you try to convince him, he probably won't listen.
        hint: 「～としても」 is generally used for 'even if' but lacks the strong sense of futility or a dismissed
          effort that 「(っ)たって」 conveys. We're looking for that resignation about a futile attempt.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 を 説得 し て も、多分 聞き入れ ない だろう な。
        english: Even if you convince him, he probably won't listen.
        hint: 「～ても」 expresses a simple concession. 「(っ)たって」 specifically implies that the *effort* of
          trying is useless, not just the outcome. We need to emphasize the futility of the attempt itself.
    scene: Two friends discussing a stubborn third friend who refuses to change his mind.
    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic
    conjugation: volitional (～よう)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「だろう な」 at the end, coupled with 「説得しよう ったって」, emphasizes the speaker's resignation
      and low expectation of success. The phrase 「聞き入れない」 implies a strong refusal to accept advice or
      persuasion, common when dealing with someone stubborn.
    etymology: 「聞き入れる」 means to listen and accept, often implying to accede to someone's request or advice.
      It combines 「聞く」 (to hear/listen) and 「入れる」 (to put in/accept).
  - english: Even if it was a big mistake, we have to learn from it and move forward.
    japanese:
      - 大きな 失敗 {だっ た って}、そこ から 学ん で 進む しか ない。
      - どんな に 大きな 失敗 {だっ た って}、教訓 に する べき だ。
      - あれ が 大きな 失敗 {だっ た って}、前向き に 捉える しか ない だろ。

        english: Even if it was a big mistake, we have to learn from it and move forward.
        hint: 「～でも」 is a general 'even if' for nouns. 「(っ)たって」 here carries a stronger nuance of acknowledging
          the negative event but immediately dismissing its power to stop progress, emphasizing resilience.
          We want that resilient nuance.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 大きな 失敗 だ と は いえ、そこ から 学ん で 進む しか ない。
        english: Though it was a big mistake, we have to learn from it and move forward.
        hint: 「とはいえ」 means 'though that said' or 'it is true that... but'. It's more formal and less direct
          than 「(っ)たって」, which directly acknowledges the condition and then emphatically brushes it aside
          as insufficient reason to stop. We need the direct, emphatic tone.
    scene: A mentor advising a mentee who is discouraged by a significant setback.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: inspirational
    nuance: The phrase 「～しか ない」 expresses that there is no other option, highlighting the necessity of
      moving forward. The speaker uses 「だったって」 to acknowledge the past negative event while immediately
      pivoting to a constructive attitude, showing resilience.
    etymology: 「前向きに捉える」 means to perceive something positively or to take a forward-looking view. 「前向き」
      (maemuki) means 'forward-looking' or 'positive', and 「捉える」 (toraeru) means 'to grasp' or 'to perceive'.
  - english: Even if it's cheap, is it really good quality?
    japanese:
      - 安い {ったって}、本当 に 品質 は 大丈夫 な の？
      - 安い {ったって}、すぐ 壊れ たら 困る ん だ けど。

          - 安く て も、本当 に 品質 は 大丈夫 な の？
        english: Even if it's cheap, is it really good quality?
        hint: 「～ても」 is a general 'even if' for i-adjectives. 「(っ)たって」 here adds a tone of skepticism or
          doubt, implying that being cheap doesn't necessarily mean it's worth buying. We're looking for
          that skeptical tone.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 安い と は いえ、本当 に 品質 は 大丈夫 な の？
        english: Though it's cheap, is the quality really alright?
        hint: 「とはいえ」 acknowledges a fact but is more formal and less conversational than 「(っ)たって」, which
          conveys a more direct and often frustrated or doubtful tone about the underlying assumption.
          We need the casual, doubtful nuance.
    scene: Two friends shopping for electronics, and one expresses skepticism about a very cheap item.
    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The interrogative 「なの？」 emphasizes a strong doubt or suspicion despite the stated condition
      of being cheap. This is a common way to express skepticism about something that seems too good to
      be true.
    etymology: 「品質」 (hinshitsu) means quality. It is a compound word formed from 「品」 (hin), meaning 'goods'
      or 'articles', and 「質」 (shitsu), meaning 'quality' or 'substance'.
  - english: Even if it's just a game, if you don't play seriously, it's not fun.

        english: Even if it's a game, if you don't play seriously, it's not fun.
        hint: 「～でも」 can mean 'even for'. 「(っ)たって」 emphasizes a dismissal of the 'it's just a game' excuse,
          implying that despite its nature, seriousness is still required for enjoyment. We want the nuance
          of dismissing the premise.
    scene: A parent telling their child to take their game more seriously.
    register: casual
    setting: instructional
    nuance: The direct address and the use of 「～ない と 面白く ない」 (if not, it's not fun) emphasize the conditional
      necessity of seriousness. The informal 「よ」 makes it a gentle but firm piece of advice.
    etymology: The phrase 「真剣 に やる」 means to do something seriously. 「真剣」 (shinken) refers to seriousness
      or earnestness.
  - english: Even if you don't go, the result won't change.
    japanese:
      - 行か ない {ったって}、結果 は 変わら ない よ。
      - 行か ない {ったって}、もう どう に も なら ない さ。
      - 行か ない {ったって}、もう 遅い ん だ から。
    english_literally: Even if you don't go, the result won't change, you know.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 行か なく て も、結果 は 変わら ない よ。
        english: Even if you don't go, the result won't change.
        hint: 「～なくても」 means 'even if not'. 「(っ)たって」 implies a dismissal of not going as an alternative
          that would change the outcome, emphasizing the futility of inaction. We want the sense of futility
          despite an alternative choice.
    scene: A friend trying to persuade another who is reluctant to attend an event, emphasizing that their
      absence won't alter the situation.
    register: casual
    setting: persuasive
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「～ない よ」 provides a direct but soft assertion. 「結果 は 変わら ない」 (the result won't change)
      combined with 「(っ)たって」 powerfully conveys that the action (or inaction) being discussed is irrelevant
      to the predetermined outcome, expressing a sense of resignation.
    etymology: The combination of 「変わる」 (kawaru, to change) with a negative form (e.g., 「変わらない」) is a
      common way to express immutability. 「結果」 (kekka) means 'result' or 'consequence'.
post_example_writeup: Understanding the nuances of 「(っ)たって」 requires careful attention to context, particularly
  the speaker's underlying sentiment. It's often used when expressing a sense of resignation, frustration,
  or a strong dismissal of a given condition or statement. While it shares some semantic territory with
  other concessive forms, its colloquial nature and strong implication of futility set it apart.
