    "etymology": "The phrase 「おまけに」 comes from the noun 「おまけ」, meaning \"extra,\" \"bonus,\" or \"freebie,\" combined with the particle 「に」. It carries the nuance of something being added on to something else, either positively or negatively.",
    "writeup": "「おまけに」 is a conjunction used to connect two clauses, (A) and (B), indicating that (B) is added to (A). It stems from the noun 「おまけ」, which refers to a \"discount\" or \"freebie.\" While 「おまけ」 is typically used for positive additions, 「おまけに」 can convey \"in addition,\" \"on top of that,\" or \"what's more,\" regardless of whether the initial topic is positive or negative. However, both (A) and (B) must be either both good or both bad. It emphasizes that (B) acts as a 'bonus,' either in a good or bad way, highlighting that (A) is already sufficient on its own.",
