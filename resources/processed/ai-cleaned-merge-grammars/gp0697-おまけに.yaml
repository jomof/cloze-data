        "function": "Adds an additional point or consequence that acts as a 'bonus' or 'extra' to a previously stated situation.",
        "nuance": "Implies that the initial situation is sufficient on its own, and the added information (Clause B) further enhances or worsens it, similar to 'icing on the cake' or 'insult to injury'. The tone of Clause A and Clause B must align (both positive or both negative)."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase おまけに comes from the noun おまけ, which means \"an extra, a bonus, or a freebie.\" に is a particle indicating direction or purpose. Together, they create a phrase that adds something extra to a situation, whether positive or negative.",
    "writeup": "おまけに functions as a conjunction to link two clauses, Clause A and Clause B, indicating that Clause B is an additional point to Clause A. Its origin lies in the noun おまけ, meaning \"a discount\" or \"a freebie,\" which implies something given in addition to a primary purchase.\n\nWhile the noun おまけ primarily conveys positive additional items, おまけに as a phrase can express \"in addition,\" \"on top of that,\" or \"what's more,\" irrespective of whether the overall situation is positive or negative. A crucial aspect of using おまけに is that Clause A and Clause B must maintain a consistent tone; both must be either positive or both negative. You will not find a mix.\n\nFormed by combining おまけ with the particle に, this phrase typically appears at the beginning of a new sentence or at the start of the second clause within a two-part sentence. The core nuance of おまけに is that Clause A, by itself, is already significant or sufficient. Clause B then acts as an 'extra'—either adding 'icing on the cake' for positive scenarios or 'insult to injury' for negative ones. This distinguishes it from more neutral connectors that simply add information.",
