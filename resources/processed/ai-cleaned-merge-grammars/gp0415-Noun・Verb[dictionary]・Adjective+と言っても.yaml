    "etymology": "The grammar point 「と言っても」 is formed from 「と言う」 (to say) and 「ても」 (even if). The combination creates a nuance of setting up an expectation, then tempering it. 「と言う」 functions here to introduce the preceding statement as a quotation or a generally accepted idea, while 「ても」 adds the sense of \"even if\" or \"even though,\" indicating a contrast or reservation.",
    "writeup": "「Noun・Verb[dictionary]・Adjective + {と言っても}」 means \"Although I say...\" or \"Even though I say...\". It's used to present information but then qualify it, often to reduce expectations or provide a more accurate picture. The speaker highlights something, but then draws attention to a contrasting point. Essentially, it sets up a statement then immediately provides a caveat. This can be used with nouns, verbs in dictionary form, and adjectives. When used with な-adjectives and nouns, 「だ」 is sometimes included but often omitted.",
