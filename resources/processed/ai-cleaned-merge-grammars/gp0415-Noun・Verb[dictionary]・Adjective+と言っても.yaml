    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from 「と言う」 (to say) and 「ても」 (even if). Therefore, it literally means \"even if I say.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「と言っても」 combines 「と言う」 (to say) and 「ても」 (even if). It translates to \"even if I say (A)\" or \"although I say (A).\" It's used when the speaker wants to emphasize a point (A) but then clarify it with another point (B). This draws the listener's attention to (B) to provide further context or explanation. It can follow almost any word in any tense because of the case-marking particle 「と」. When used after nouns or na-adjectives, 「だ」 can be added, but it's often omitted. If no speaker is identified with 「が」, 「と言っても」 could mean \"although some might say (A)\" or \"even though it is said that (A).\"",
