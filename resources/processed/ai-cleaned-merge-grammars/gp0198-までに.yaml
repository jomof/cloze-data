        "function": "Indicates a time limit or target for completion.",
        "nuance": "The particle に acts to mark the preceding time or event as a distinct target or deadline for the completion of an action. This contrasts with まで (made), which signifies continuation up to a point. While まで focuses on the duration leading up to a point, までに emphasizes that the action must be completed at or prior to that point.",

    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point までに (madeni) is a combination of two particles: まで (made), meaning \"until\" or \"as far as,\" and に (ni), which functions as a target or directional marker. Historically, まで originally meant \"as far as\" in terms of a temporal limit. When に is added, it specifies that this limit is a target for completion, thus shifting the nuance from mere continuation to a deadline. This grammatical evolution reflects the need to precisely distinguish between an action that continues *up to* a point and an action that must be *completed by* a specific point.",
    "writeup": "までに (madeni) is a crucial temporal particle combination in Japanese that signifies a **deadline** or a specific time **by which** an action must be completed. It is formed by attaching the case-marking particle に (ni) to the adverbial particle まで (made).\n\nThe key distinction lies in the role of に. While まで (made) on its own can mean \"until\" or \"up to\" a certain point, implying a continuous action or state leading to that point, までに adds the nuance of a *target* or *limit* for the *completion* of an action. Therefore, までに always implies that the action happens as a single event, or reaches completion, at or before the specified time.\n\n**Formation:**\n*   **Noun (time) + までに**: For example, 「明日までに」 (by tomorrow), 「5時までに」 (by 5 o'clock).\n*   **Verb (non-past informal) + までに**: For example, 「終わるまでに」 (by the time it finishes), 「来るまでに」 (by the time someone comes).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **まで vs. までに**: This is the most common point of confusion. Consider the following:\n    *   「明日まで本を読む。」 (I will read books *until* tomorrow.) – Implies continuous reading that stops tomorrow.\n    *   「明日までに本を読む。」 (I will read a book *by* tomorrow.) – Implies completing the reading of a book by tomorrow.\n*   **Ambiguity with broad events**: For general timeframes like 「夏までに」 (by summer), there can sometimes be ambiguity. It could mean \"by the start of summer\" or \"before the end of summer.\" To avoid this, it's often clearer to specify: 「夏が始まるまでに」 (by the time summer starts) or 「夏が終わるまでに」 (by the time summer ends).\n\nUnderstanding までに is essential for expressing deadlines and temporal constraints accurately in Japanese.",

For example, 「寝る前に歯を磨く」 (brush teeth *before* going to bed) specifies a sequence, not a deadline for brushing teeth."
