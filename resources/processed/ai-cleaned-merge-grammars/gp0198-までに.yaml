    "etymology": "までに is a combination of まで (made), meaning \"until\" or \"as far as,\" and に (ni), a particle that often indicates a target or destination. Essentially, it marks a point in time \"by which\" something must be completed.",
    "writeup": "までに indicates a deadline or time limit. It is similar to まで when まで means \"until,\" butまでに means \"by,\" not \"until.\"\n\nまでに is attached to the end of a noun or a verb in the non-past form.\n\nTo understand the difference between まで and までに, remember that に marks a 'target' or 'destination'.  までに literally means '(A) as far as (に marks the target), (B)'.\n\nOriginally, まで meant \"as far as\" in regard to the passing of a particular event. However, in modern Japanese, most people will assume that the speaker means \"by the beginning of (A).\" Due to this, sentences that have a very broad event, such as 夏までに could be interpreted as \"by the start of summer\" or \"before the end of summer,\" depending on who you are talking to. In these cases, it would be better to add a more specific time frame.",
