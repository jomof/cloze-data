    "etymology": "The expression 「と同じくらい」 is composed of 「と」(a particle indicating comparison), 「同じ」(meaning \"same\"), and 「くらい」(meaning \"about\" or \"approximately\"). Thus, it literally translates to \"about the same as.\"",
    "writeup": "The expression 「と同じくらい」 is used to indicate that something is \"about the same as\" something else. It's a combination of the particle 「と」, the noun 「同じ」 (same), and the adverbial particle 「くらい」. To use 「と同じくらい」, attach it to a noun that you want to highlight as a prime example. Whatever is comparable to it comes later in the sentence. If you want to express that an action is performed in 'almost the same way' as (A), 「に」 may replace 「の」 after 「くらい」.",
