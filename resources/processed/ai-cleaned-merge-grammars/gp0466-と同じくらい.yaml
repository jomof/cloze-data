    "etymology": "This grammar point is a combination of 「と」 (a particle indicating comparison or quotation), 「同じ」 (onaji, meaning 'same'), and 「くらい」 (kurai, meaning 'about, approximately'). Thus, 「と同じくらい」 literally means 'about the same as'.",
    "writeup": "「と同じくらい」 (to onaji kurai) is used to indicate that something is approximately the same as something else. It emphasizes similarity in terms of size, age, speed, price, or any other measurable quality. The basic structure is: **[Noun] + と同じくらい + [Comparable Noun/Phrase]**. This grammar point expresses that something is 'about the same as' or 'no less than' something else.\n\n*   You can use 「の」 or 「に」 after 「くらい」 to connect it to what follows. 「の」 is used to compare nouns, while 「に」 is used to compare actions or manners.",
