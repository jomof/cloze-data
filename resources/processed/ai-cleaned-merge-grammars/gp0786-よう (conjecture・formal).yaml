details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used in writing and formal speech only. Expresses the speaker's conjecture or certainty
    about a potential or existing state. Often used with non-controllable verbs or to express what is
    natural or expected.
  grammatical-role: modal auxiliary
  logical-flow: inference
  temporal-flow: present/future conjecture
etymology: The grammar point 「よう」 originates from the classical Japanese auxiliary verb 「む」 (mu), which
  expressed conjecture, intention, or purpose. Over time, it evolved and converged with the volitional
  form of verbs (e.g., 行かむ → 行こう). Its connection to 「言う(いう)」 (iu) (to say) is a common misunderstanding;
  while 「言う」 expresses direct verbalization, 「よう」 in this context has primarily functioned as a modal
  auxiliary for conjecture and suggestion.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「よう」 expresses conjecture, high probability, or what is natural to expect. It is frequently used in written language and formal speech, lending a more formal and literary tone compared to its modern counterpart 「だろう」. Here are its primary usages:

  *   **Verb (plain form) + よう / であろう**: This is used with verbs (including potential, negative, and past forms) to indicate likelihood or possibility. For example, 「読めよう」 (yomeyou) implies that something can probably be read or understood, often in a general or objective sense. 「であろう」 often carries a slightly stronger sense of certainty or a more detached, analytical tone.

  *   **I-Adjective (stem) + かろう / (Plain Form) + であろう**: 「かろう」 is a classical and literary form of conjecture for i-adjectives, as seen in 「苦しかろう」. A more regular formal expression is to attach 「であろう」 to the plain form of the i-adjective, like 「苦しいであろう」.

  *   **Noun / な-Adjective (stem) + であろう / (である)よう**: This form is used with nouns and な-adjectives to express a likely or certain state of being. For instance, 「便利であろう」 (benri de arou) suggests that something is probably or must be convenient, often presented as an objective assessment. 「であるよう」 is another formal option, emphasizing the state or condition.

  **Important Considerations**:

  *   「よう」 is significantly more formal and literary than 「だろう」. It is rarely heard in casual conversation in modern Japanese, making it primarily a feature of written communication, academic discourse, or very formal speeches.
  *   It often conveys a sense of logical conclusion or inherent truth, rather than a mere guess. This makes it suitable when discussing general principles or outcomes that are presented as self-evident.
  *   While it shares semantic overlap with 「だろう」, the choice between them largely depends on the desired register and formality. In contemporary spoken Japanese, 「だろう」 is overwhelmingly more common for expressing conjecture.
false_friends:
  - term: だろう
    meaning: probably, I think, isn't it?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だろう」 is functionally similar to 「よう」 in expressing conjecture, but it is much more common
      in casual conversation and less formal writing. It can also carry an interrogative nuance, seeking
      confirmation, which 「よう」 typically does not.
    grammar_point: だろう・でしょう (probably・right?)
  - term: でしょう
    meaning: probably, I think, right?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「でしょう」 is the polite form of 「だろう」. While 「よう」 is formal and often literary, 「でしょう」 is polite
      and commonly used in spoken language and polite writing for expressing conjecture, seeking confirmation,
      or softening statements.
    grammar_point: だろう・でしょう (probably・right?)
  - term: に違いない
    meaning: must be, I'm sure that...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に違いない」 expresses a stronger degree of certainty or conviction than 「よう」. While 「よう」 suggests
      likelihood or probability, 「に違いない」 implies that there is little to no doubt about the conclusion.
    grammar_point: に違いない (no doubt)
  - term: はずだ
    meaning: it should be, it is expected that...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「はずだ」 indicates an expectation or strong probability based on known facts, reasons, or common
      knowledge. While 「よう」 expresses general conjecture, 「はずだ」 implies a more grounded expectation.
    grammar_point: '[Clause]はずだ・はずがない (is expected to be・cannot be)'
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「よう」, 「だろう」, 「でしょう」, 「に違いない」, and 「はずだ」 all express some form of likelihood
  or conjecture, they differ significantly in their nuance, formality, and the degree of certainty they
  convey. 「よう」 is the most formal and literary, primarily found in written or highly formal spoken contexts,
  conveying a logical or objective conclusion. 「だろう」 is its casual counterpart, frequently used in everyday
  conversation. 「でしょう」 is the polite form of 「だろう」, suitable for polite conversation and writing. 「に違いない」
  expresses a much stronger certainty, implying little to no doubt. Finally, 「はずだ」 denotes an expectation
  based on known information or reasons. Choosing the correct expression depends heavily on the context,
  desired level of formality, and the speaker's confidence in the conjecture.

          for a formal expression of likelihood, not a casual one like 「だろう」, which would be too informal
          for this setting and speaker role. 「よう」 conveys a more objective and certain deduction about

          rather than the natural characteristic that allows for a broader, objective assertion with 「よう」.

          for inherent uncertainty, as 「に違い ない」 would imply an absolute certainty that might be imprudent
          in a legal setting, where outcomes are never 100% guaranteed. 「よう」 allows for a high degree
          of confidence without being overly absolute.
