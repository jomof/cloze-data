    "etymology": "The phrase 「～ようとする」 combines the volitional form of a verb (～よう) which expresses a speaker's intention or will, with the verb 「とする」 meaning \"to try to do\" or \"to be about to do\". The particle 「と」 marks the preceding clause as a direct quotation or a thought/intention. The final particle 「が」 (or its variations like 「けれど」/「けど」/「たら」) acts as a conjunction, indicating a contrast, an unexpected result, or an obstacle. Thus, the entire construction emphasizes an action that was intended or on the verge of happening, but was subsequently interrupted or prevented. The past tense of する (した) indicates that the attempt or being about to do something has already occurred.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「Verb[volitional-よう] + としたが」 is used to describe a situation where someone was **about to** do something, or **tried to** do something, but an unexpected event or circumstance prevented the action from being completed. It conveys a sense of an interrupted or unrealized action.\n\nThis structure strongly implies that the interruption was **unanticipated** or unforeseen, thereby thwarting the intended action. It often describes a specific moment of initiation or intent that was then met with an obstacle. The clause after 「が」 typically provides the reason why the action could not be carried out.\n\nWhile 「～ようとする」 itself expresses intention or an attempt, the addition of 「が」 or similar concessive particles introduces a contrast, highlighting that the intended action did not come to fruition due to some interference.",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「Verb[volitional] + としたが」, 「Verb[volitional] + とする」 does not necessarily imply an interruption or unrealized action. It simply expresses the intent or attempt without commenting on its outcome or if it was completed successfully or not.",
