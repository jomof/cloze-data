    "etymology": "The grammar point combines 「ある」 (aru), meaning \"to exist\" (for inanimate objects), with a noun. The 「が」 (ga) particle marks the subject of the verb 「ある」.",
    "writeup": "This grammatical pattern is used to modify a noun, indicating that it possesses something or is associated with something. The structure is \"(A) がある (B)\", meaning \"(B) has / is equipped with (A)\". This is known as a relative clause, functioning similarly to an adjective to describe the noun.\n\nUnlike English, Japanese does not require relative pronouns such as \"who,\" \"which,\" or \"that\"; the noun directly follows \"がある.\"\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   In a relative clause, the noun being described (B) is the main topic or subject. Therefore, 「は」 is generally not used in place of 「が」. However, 「の」 can sometimes be used instead of 「が」, as showing a relationship between (A) and (B) is one of the main functions of 「の」.",
