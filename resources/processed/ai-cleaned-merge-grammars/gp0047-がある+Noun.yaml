    "etymology": "The grammar point combines 「ある」 (aru), meaning \"to exist\" (for inanimate objects), with a noun. The 「が」 (ga) particle marks the subject of the verb 「ある」.",
    "writeup": "This grammar pattern describes a noun by indicating that it possesses or is associated with something. The structure is '(A) がある (B)' = '(B) has/with (A)'. This creates a relative clause, which functions like an adjective modifying the noun. In Japanese, unlike English, relative clauses don't require pronouns like \"who,\" \"which,\" or \"that.\" The noun directly follows 「がある」.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   In a relative clause, the noun being described (B) is the main topic/subject. Therefore, 「は」 is generally not used in place of 「が」. 「の」 can be used instead of 「が」 to show a relationship between (A) and (B).",
