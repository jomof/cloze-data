    "etymology": "The particle 「しか」 implies a limitation or restriction. When combined with a negative verb 「ない」, it creates the nuance of 'nothing but' or 'only'. The number specifies the quantity being limited.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「しか」 is similar to 「だけ」 in that both can express \"only.\" However, 「しか」 **must** be used with a negative verb. Therefore, 「しか〜ない」 translates to \"there's only (A)\" or \"there's nothing but (A).\" This grammar point is used with numbers to indicate a limited quantity. It often carries a nuance of insufficiency, regret, or a negative sentiment regarding the smallness of the quantity.",
