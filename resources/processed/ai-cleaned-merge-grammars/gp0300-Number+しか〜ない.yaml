    "etymology": "The particle しか originally comes from the verb 然る (しかる), meaning \"to be so\" or \"to be that way.\" It evolved to indicate a limited or restricted state, hence its use to express \"only\" or \"nothing but.\"",
    "writeup": "The adverbial particle 「しか」 is often compared to 「だけ」, as both express \"only.\" However, 「しか」 can **only** be used in negative statements. Because of this, 「しか〜ない」 is regularly translated as \"there's only (A)\" or \"there's nothing but (A).\" 「しか〜ない」 may be used to express numbers or nouns; this lesson focuses on numbers. To use this construction, place the number you want to express as being \"all that exists\" before 「しか」, then follow 「しか」 with a verb in its 「ない」 or 「ありません」 form.\n\nImportant Consideration:\nThe main difference between 「しか」 and 「だけ」 is that 「だけ」 suggests (A) was \"chosen\" from among a group where several other choices exist. 「しか」, on the other hand, implies that there are no other choices, and (A) is the only possibility/thing that exists.",
