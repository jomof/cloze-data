jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: general
  function: expresses spontaneous visibility or appearance
  nuance: implies passive observation, not active effort to see
  counterpoint: 見られる (potential form of 見る) implies active effort or ability to see
  grammatical-role: intransitive verb
  temporal-flow: can be used for present, past, or future visibility
  spatial-flow: describes what is visible from a certain location or direction
etymology: 見える is derived from the verb 見る (miru), meaning "to see." Over time, it evolved into an intransitive
  verb, indicating that something is visible without active intention. It also gained a usage to describe
  appearance or seeming.
writeup: "The grammar point 見える (mieru) is an intransitive verb used to describe something that is **visible**\
  \ or **can be seen spontaneously** without conscious effort. It inherently expresses a state of being\
  \ seen, much like 聞こえる (kikoeru) expresses a state of being audible.\n\nWhen using 見える to describe something\
  \ that is visible, the object that is seen is typically marked with the particle が. For instance, 「富士山\
  \ が 見える」 (Fuji-san ga mieru) means \"Mount Fuji is visible\" or \"Mount Fuji can be seen.\"\n\n見える can\
  \ also be used to describe **how something appears or looks**. In this case, it is often preceded by\
  \ an adverbial modifier. For example, an い-adjective will change to its く-form (e.g., 小さい → 小さく), and\
  \ a な-adjective or noun will be followed by に (e.g., きれいな → きれいに, 学生 → 学生に). For instance, 「小さく 見える」\
  \ (chiisaku mieru) means \"it looks small,\" and 「学生に 見える」 (gakusei ni mieru) means \"he/she looks like\
  \ a student.\"\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\nThe primary distinction between 見える and 見られる (mirareru),\
  \ the potential form of 見る (miru), lies in the **intentionality of seeing**. \n\n*   **見える** implies\
  \ that something simply comes into your field of vision, often without active concentration. It's about\
  \ what is *unavoidably visible* if you are in the right position.\n*   **見られる** on the other hand, implies\
  \ the *ability* to see something, often requiring effort, focus, or specific conditions to be met. For\
  \ example, if you are looking for a rare bird, you might say 「鳥 が 見られる」 (tori ga mirareru) meaning \"\
  I can see the bird\" (implying you successfully spotted it).\n\nAdditionally, 見える can refer to the **sense\
  \ of sight itself**, indicating whether a person has the faculty of vision or not. For example, 「目 が\
  \ 見えない」 (me ga mienai) means \"cannot see\" or \"is blind.\"\n\nWhile 見える was historically a potential\
  \ form of 見る, it has evolved into a distinct intransitive verb in modern Japanese, focusing on the state\
  \ of visibility rather than the action of seeing."
false_friends:
  - term: 見られる
    meaning: to be able to see; can see (potential of 見る)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 見られる implies an active ability or permission to see, often requiring effort or specific conditions.
      For example, 「努力すれば道が見られる」 (If you try, you can see the path). In contrast, 見える describes a passive
      state of being visible without active intention.
    grammar_point: Verb[(ら)れる] (potential)
  - term: とみえる
    meaning: it seems; it appears (deduction based on observation)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: とみえる (e.g., 「疲れているとみえる」 'he seems tired') expresses a speaker's inference or deduction about
      a situation based on observation, rather than simply stating something is visible. It functions
      as a sentence-final expression indicating a conclusion. 見える focuses on direct visual appearance.
    grammar_point: とみえる (seems from observation)
  - term: らしい
    meaning: appears to be; seems (based on hearsay or logical inference)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: らしい conveys a sense of conjecture or inference based on what is heard or observed, often with
      a subtle nuance of vagueness or indirectness. It implies the speaker's judgment about something's
      nature. In contrast, 見える describes a direct visual appearance or a spontaneous state of visibility.
    grammar_point: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)'
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between 見える, 見られる, とみえる, and らしい, remember that 見える describes
  what is passively visible or how something appears visually without intentional effort. 見られる, the potential
  form of 見る, indicates an active ability to see something. とみえる implies a deduction or inference about
  a situation based on observation, often used as a sentence-final conclusion. らしい, on the other hand,
  expresses a conjecture or inference based on information or general impression, carrying a sense of
  likelihood rather than direct visual evidence.
examples:
  - english: Mount Fuji is visible from the window.
    japanese:
      - 窓 から 富士 山 が {見え ます}。
      - 窓 から 富士 山 が {見える}。
    english_literally: From the window, Mount Fuji is visible.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 窓 から 富士 山 が {見 られ ます}。
        english: Mount Fuji can be seen from the window (implying ability).
        hint: 「見られます」 indicates an active ability to see something. We're looking for an expression that
          describes something passively visible.
    scene: You are staying in a hotel room with a great view and want to tell someone about it.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: The use of 「見えます」 politely conveys that Mount Fuji is simply there, in one's field of vision,
      without any active effort to look at it.
    etymology: The particle 「から」 indicates the origin or point from which something is seen, in this case,
      'from the window'. 「が」 marks the subject of the intransitive verb 見える, indicating what is visible.
  - english: There's a small building visible in the distance, but I wonder what it is.
    japanese:
      - 遠く に 小さな 建物 が {見える} けど、あれ は 何 だろう。

          - 遠く に 小さな 建物 が {見つけ られる} けど、あれ は 何 だろう。
        english: A small building can be spotted in the distance, but I wonder what it is.
        hint: 「見つけられる」 implies an active act of spotting or finding something. We're looking for something
          that is simply in sight.
    scene: You are on a train journey and notice something unclear out the window, asking your travel
      companion.
    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The casual ending 「けど」 (but) connects two clauses, expressing a mild doubt or question about
      the visible building. 「何だろう」 (I wonder what it is) is a common casual male expression for pondering
      something.
    etymology: The use of 「～だろう」 comes from 「であろう」 which is a volitional form of the copula 「だ」, used
      to express conjecture or uncertainty. 「遠く に」 indicates location or direction, here meaning 'in the
      distance'.
  - english: Does this outfit make me look fat?

        english: Does this outfit make me feel fat?
        hint: 「感じる」 refers to one's own subjective feeling. We're looking for how something appears visually
          to someone.
    scene: A woman tries on a new outfit before an event and asks her friend for an honest opinion.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The casual ending 「かな」 suggests a personal, slightly unsure inquiry, typical in close conversations.
      The female speaker's concern over appearance is a common nuance for female speakers. 「私 に は」 emphasizes
      the perspective of 'to me' or 'in my eyes'.
    etymology: The 「て」 form of the verb 「太る」 (futoru, to get fat) combined with 「見える」 forms a construction
      meaning 'looks/appears to be [state]'. This is common for describing appearance with adjectives.
  - english: That job looks difficult, but it's actually easy.

        english: That job seems difficult, but it's actually easy.
        hint: 「～そうだ」 often indicates something appears to be a certain way based on observation or hearsay.
          We're looking for how it visually presents itself.
    scene: You are giving advice to a friend who is hesitant about taking on a new task.
    register: casual
    setting: supportive
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The use of 「難しく 見える」 (looks difficult) implies a visual impression rather than a proven fact.
      The sentence-final particle 「よ」 adds emphasis and conveys certainty or advice from the speaker.
    etymology: 「難しく」 is the adverbial form of the い-adjective 「難しい」 (muzukashii, difficult), commonly
      used to modify verbs like 見える to describe how something 'appears' or 'looks'.
  - english: If you darken the room, the stars should be clearly visible.

        english: If you darken the room, the stars should clearly be able to be seen.
        hint: 「見られる」 refers to the ability to see. We're looking for something that indicates the stars
          will become apparent to the eye.
    scene: You are explaining to a child how to best see stars at night.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「見える はず です」 expresses a strong expectation or likelihood, indicating that under the specified
      conditions (darkening the room), the stars will naturally become visible. The polite 「です」 makes
      it suitable for instructing a child.
    etymology: 「はず です」 is a grammatical construction indicating expectation or certainty, originating
      from 「筈」, a noun meaning 'expectation' or 'schedule'. 「はっきりと」 is an adverb meaning 'clearly', derived
      from 「はっきり」, an onomatopoeic word suggesting clarity.

        english: He is so youthful that you can't believe he's old.

          that describes someone's visual appearance.
    scene: You are complimenting an acquaintance's youthful appearance to another friend.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「年寄り に 見えない」 (doesn't look like an old person) is a specific negative usage of 見える describing
      appearance. The combination with 「くらい」 (to the extent that) emphasizes the degree of his youthfulness.
      The final 「ね」 seeks agreement and fosters a friendly atmosphere, common in female conversation.
    etymology: The particle 「に」 here indicates the state or appearance something takes, meaning 'as' or
      'like'. 「くらい」 (often written in hiragana) indicates degree or extent, originally from 「位」 meaning
      'rank' or 'position'.
  - english: Due to an old accident, he cannot see with his left eye.

          - 昔 の 事故 の せい で、彼 は 左目 を {見る こと が でき ませ ん}。
        english: Because of an old accident, he cannot look with his left eye.
        hint: 「見る こと が でき ませ ん」 implies an inability to actively look at something. We're looking for
          a statement about the involuntary state of vision itself.
    scene: You are explaining someone's visual impairment to a sympathetic listener.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    nuance: 「見えません」 here refers to the physical inability to see, emphasizing a permanent state rather
      than a temporary action. 「～の せい で」 (due to) explicitly indicates the cause of his impaired vision,
      conveying a factual and slightly sympathetic tone.
    etymology: 「せい」 (lit. 'fault' or 'reason') in 「～の せい で」 indicates a cause, often for something negative.
      It's a common phrase for attributing responsibility or reason.
  - english: In this darkness, the characters become difficult to see.

      - この 暗 さ で は、文字 が {見え にくく} なり ます。
      - この 暗 さ で は、文字 が {見え にくく} なる。
    english_literally: In this darkness, characters become hard to be seen.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 暗 さ で は、文字 が {読み づらく} なり ます。
        english: In this darkness, the characters become hard to read.
        hint: 「読みづらい」 specifically refers to the difficulty of reading. We're looking for a general difficulty
          in being visible or discernible.
    scene: You are advising someone trying to read in poor lighting.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「見え にくく なり ます」 (becomes difficult to see) uses the suffix 「～にくい」, which indicates difficulty
      in performing an action or experiencing a state. It highlights the passive challenge of discerning
      characters in low light conditions.
    etymology: The suffix 「～にくい」 is affixed to the stem of a verb to indicate difficulty, while 「～くなる」
      is a common verb ending that expresses a change of state. 「暗さ」 is a noun derived from the adjective
      「暗い」 (kurai, dark), meaning 'darkness'.
  - english: Your face looks pale. Are you okay?
    japanese:
      - 顔色 が 青く {見え ます} が、大丈夫 です か。

    english_literally: Complexion looks pale, but, are you okay?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 顔色 が 青い {そう です} が、大丈夫 です か。
        english: It seems your complexion is pale, are you okay?
        hint: 「～そうだ」 often indicates something appears a certain way based on general observation or hearsay.
          We're looking for a direct visual appearance.
    scene: You notice a friend or colleague looks unwell and you want to express concern.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: serious
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: 「青く 見えます」 uses the adverbial form of 「青い」 (aoi, blue/pale) with 見える to describe a visual state.
      The particle 「が」 here acts as a soft connector before the polite question 「大丈夫 です か」, expressing
      concern.
    etymology: 「顔色」 (kaoiro) literally means 'face color', referring to one's complexion or pallor. The
      adverbial form 「青く」 is essential for modifying 見える to describe how the color appears.
  - english: From here, the entire city can be seen.
    japanese:
      - ここ から は、街 全体 が {見え ます}。
      - ここ から は、街 全体 が {見える}。
    english_literally: From here, the entire city is visible.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ここ から は、街 全体 を {見る こと が でき ます}。
        english: From here, you can see the entire city.
        hint: 「見る こと が でき ます」 emphasizes the active ability to see. We're looking for a statement about
          the passive state of being visible from a certain point.
    scene: You are standing at a high viewpoint, like an observation deck, and describing the panoramic
      view.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: 「ここ から は」 specifies the location and uses the topic particle 「は」 to highlight the vantage
      point. 「街 全体 が 見えます」 conveys that the city is spontaneously and comprehensively visible, without
      any special effort from the observer.
    etymology: 「街」 (machi) refers to a town or city. 「全体」 (zentai) means 'whole' or 'entirety'. The combination
      emphasizes the completeness of what is visible. 「ここ から」 indicates the starting point of observation.
  - english: The truth is starting to become visible.
    japanese:
      - 真実 が {見え} 始め て い ます。
      - 真実 が {見え} 始め て いる。
    english_literally: The truth has started to become visible.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 真実 が {分かり} 始め て い ます。
        english: The truth is starting to be understood.
        hint: 「分かる」 refers to understanding or knowing something. We're looking for the sense of something
          visually emerging or becoming clear.
    scene: After a long investigation, you are discussing the emerging facts with a colleague.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: serious
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「見え 始め て い ます」 (is starting to become visible) uses the `Verb[masu-stem]+はじめる` construction
      to indicate the beginning of a process. Here, it metaphorically means the truth is gradually becoming
      clear, like an object slowly emerging from fog. It suggests an ongoing revelation.
    etymology: 「始める」 (hajimeru) means 'to begin' or 'to start'. When combined with the ます-stem of another
      verb, it indicates the beginning of that action or state. This usage of 見える extends beyond literal
      sight to abstract concepts.
  - english: I can see a light at the end of the tunnel.
    japanese:
      - トンネル の 先 に 光 が {見え ます}。
      - トンネル の 先 に 光 が {見える}。
    english_literally: At the end of the tunnel, a light is visible.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - トンネル の 先 に 光 を {見つける こと が でき ます}。
        english: I can find a light at the end of the tunnel.
        hint: 「見つける」 implies actively searching and finding. We're looking for something that simply comes
          into view without effort.
    scene: You are encouraging someone who is going through a difficult period, using a common idiom.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: inspirational
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: This is an idiomatic use of 見える, indicating hope or a clear path forward after a period of
      difficulty. The spontaneous visibility of the light suggests a natural emergence of hope, rather
      than an effort to find it.
    etymology: 「トンネル の 先」 (tonneru no saki) literally means 'the tip/end of the tunnel'. This phrase is
      a direct translation of a common English idiom, but it functions naturally in Japanese to convey
      the same metaphorical meaning of hope appearing after a struggle.
post_example_writeup: 'The examples highlight how 見える is used both for spontaneous visibility of objects
  and to describe how something appears. The distinction from 見られる is crucial: 見える focuses on the inherent
  state of visibility, while 見られる emphasizes the ability or permission to actively see something.'
