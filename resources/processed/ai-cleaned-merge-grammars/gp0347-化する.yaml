        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "general",
        "function": "Used to denote a process of change or transformation, often implying a systematic or formal shift. Commonly used in technical, business, or academic contexts.",
        "nuance": "Implies a complete or significant transformation into a new state or form, rather than a simple modification. Often carries a sense of official or planned change.",
        "colocation": "Frequently used with nouns related to processes, states, or systems, such as 自動 (automation), デジタル (digital), 商品 (commercialization), 高齢 (aging), 活性 (revitalization), 国際 (internationalization), 具体 (concretion), 複雑 (complexity), 物質 (materialization)."
    },
    "etymology": "「化」 comes from the verb 「化ける」(bakeru), meaning \"to transform\" or \"to take the form of.\" By attaching 「化」 to a noun and adding 「する」, you create a verb that describes the process of transformation into that noun, emphasizing the act of becoming or turning into something. This suffix has a long history in Japanese, often borrowed from Chinese, and is widely used to form compound verbs denoting transformation.",
    "writeup": "The suffix **化** (か), pronounced 'ka', in Japanese means \"to change\" or \"to transform.\" When paired with **する** (suru), as in **化する**, it forms a verb meaning \"to transform into (A),\" where (A) is the noun to which **化** is attached. This grammatical structure is frequently translated into English using suffixes such as \"-ification\" or \"-ization,\" or phrases like \"to become\" or \"to make into.\"\n\nFor example, **デジタル化する** (dejitaru-ka suru) means \"to digitize\" or \"to make digital,\" and **商品化する** (shōhin-ka suru) means \"to commercialize\" or \"to make into a product.\" This construction is particularly common in technical, business, and academic discourse, where precise terminology for processes of transformation is required.\n\nWhile **化する** often implies a formal or systematic change, it can also describe natural processes. For instance, **高齢化する** (kōrei-ka suru) means \"to age\" (in reference to a population), denoting a societal demographic shift. The nuance of **化する** lies in its emphasis on the complete or significant transformation of something into a new state or form.\n\nIn some contexts, especially when **化する** modifies another noun, you might encounter it as **化した** (kashita) or with the particle **の** (no) attached, forming a noun phrase, such as **商品化した製品** (shōhin-ka shita seihin - commercialized product). This signifies that the noun has undergone the transformation. In very formal or scientific writing, the **する** verb (and sometimes even the **の** particle) might be omitted, with **化** directly attached to a noun to imply a transformed state, although this usage is less common in everyday conversation.",
