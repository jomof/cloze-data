etymology: 'The particle なんて is believed to have originated as a contraction of などと (nado to), where など
  means ''such as'' or ''and so on,'' and と is the quotative particle. This linguistic evolution explains
  its dual function: introducing casual examples (''something like this'') and expressing surprise or
  disbelief (''to think something like this!''), as if quoting an unbelievable thought.'
writeup: The particle なんて is a versatile and frequently used colloquial expression in Japanese, primarily
  serving to introduce an example casually, express mild surprise or disbelief, or form a rhetorical inquiry.
  It attaches to nouns, verbs (plain forms), and adjectives (plain forms). When なんて follows a noun, it
  often implies 'something like [Noun]' or 'things like [Noun],' used in a casual listing or illustrative
  manner. It can also suggest a degree of surprise or mild astonishment about the noun itself. When attached
  to a plain form of a verb or adjective, なんて typically conveys surprise, disbelief, or a rhetorical question
  about the action or state described. It can function similarly to an exclamation, suggesting 'How [Verb/Adjective]!'
  or 'I can't believe [Verb/Adjective]!' なんて adds a conversational and often emotional tone to the sentence,
  softening direct statements or questions. It can make a question sound more inquisitive or a statement
  more expressive of personal reaction, rather than a factual declaration. It is predominantly used in
  casual settings and between close acquaintances.
false_friends:
  - term: など
    meaning: etc., such as, and so on
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While など shares the meaning of 'such as' or 'things like,' it is generally more formal and
      less emotionally charged than なんて. なんて carries a more casual, sometimes surprised or rhetorical,
      nuance.
    grammar_point: 〜など・〜なんか (listing examples)
  - term: 〜なんて・〜なんか
    meaning: showing contempt・making light of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Although sharing the same form, なんて in this context expresses a strong sense of dismissal,
      contempt, or making light of something. This contrasts with なんて for inquiry or mild surprise, which
      is less negative in tone.
    grammar_point: 〜なんて・〜なんか (showing contempt・making light of)
  - term: って
    meaning: casual quotation marker; topic marker
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: って is a general casual marker for quoting or raising a topic. While なんて can also introduce
      a topic or thought casually, it often carries a stronger emotional nuance of surprise, disbelief,
      or rhetorical inquiry that って typically lacks.
    grammar_point: って (casual quotation・reason・topic)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing なんて from など, remember that なんて is more colloquial and
  often conveys a speaker's emotional reaction, whereas など is more neutral and formal for listing examples.
  Pay attention to the context and the speaker's tone. The nuance of contempt or making light of something
  with なんて is usually clear from the surrounding sentence and situation, often implying something is trivial
  or ridiculous. While って can also be casual, なんて introduces a stronger element of surprise or rhetorical
  questioning.
examples:
  - english: You finished it all by yourself? What a big meal!
    japanese:
      - 一人 で 全部 食べ ちゃっ た の？{なんて} 大食い な ん だろう！
      - 一人 で 全部 食べ ちゃっ た ん です か？{なんて} 大食い な ん でしょう！
      - 一人 で 全部 食っ た の か？{なんて} 大食い な ん だ よ！
      - 一人 で 全部 食べ た の？{なんて} 大食い！
    english_literally: You ate it all by yourself? What a big eater!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 一人 で 全部 食べ ちゃっ た の？とても 大食い です ね！
        english: You finished it all by yourself? You're a very big eater!
        hint: 「とても」 expresses 'very' or 'extremely' but lacks the nuance of surprise or exclamation that
          なんて conveys. We're looking for an expression that shows astonishment.
    scene: A friend (female) is surprised at how much food her male friend ate.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker, a female, uses `なんて` to express genuine surprise and a slight exclamation about
      her male friend's eating capacity. The phrase 「なんて大食いなんだろう」 emphasizes the unexpected scale of his
      eating, often used colloquially when impressed or surprised by someone's ability.
  - english: To think he would quit without saying anything. I can't believe it.
    japanese:
      - 彼 が 何 も 言わ ず に 辞める {なんて}。
      - 彼 が 何 も 言わ ず に 辞める {なんて} ね！
      - 彼 が 何 も 言わ ず に 辞める {なんて}、あり え ない！
    english_literally: That he would quit without saying anything.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が 何 も 言わ ず に 辞める こと。
        english: The fact that he would quit without saying anything.
        hint: The use of 「こと」 nominalizes the phrase but loses the strong emotional impact of disbelief
          or surprise that なんて conveys. We're looking for an expression that implies 'to think that...'
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が 何 も 言わ ず に 辞める と は。
        english: That he would quit without saying anything!
        hint: 「とは」 can express surprise, but なんて is more informal and carries a broader emotional range,
          often implying a personal reaction of disbelief, which 「とは」 does not always fully capture. We're
          looking for a more casual and emotionally nuanced expression.
    scene: Male colleagues discussing someone who suddenly left their job without notice.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: Here, `なんて` expresses the speaker's disbelief or rhetorical thought about the surprising action.
      For a male speaker, this can convey a sense of exasperation or frustration, as if saying "I can't
      believe he would do something like that."
  - english: This cat is so cute! How cute!
    japanese:
      - この 猫、{なんて} 可愛い ん だろう！
      - この 猫、{なんて} 可愛い！
      - この 猫、{なんて} 可愛い の！
      - この 猫、{なんて} 可愛い ん でしょう ね！
    english_literally: This cat, how cute!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 猫、とても 可愛い です ね！
        english: This cat is very cute!
        hint: 「とても」 means 'very' and emphasizes degree, but it lacks the exclamatory 'How cute!' nuance
          that なんて provides when expressing strong admiration or surprise. We're looking for an expression
          of strong emotional reaction.
    scene: A young person (gender neutral) seeing an extremely cute cat.
    register: casual
    setting: excited
    nuance: '`なんて` emphasizes the degree of cuteness, functioning as an exclamation similar to "How cute!".
      This usage is common across genders and ages when expressing strong positive emotion.'
  - english: You're telling me he's still single? How unlucky!
    japanese:
      - 彼 が まだ 独身 {なんて}、{なんて} 不運 な ん だろう ね。
      - 彼 が まだ 独身 {なんて}、{なんて} 不運 な の！
      - 彼 が まだ 独身 {なんて}、信じ られ ない わ！
      - 彼 が まだ 独身 {なんて}、まじ で 不運 だ わ。
    english_literally: That he's still single, how unlucky.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が まだ 独身 だ と 聞い て、残念 だ ね。
        english: I heard he's still single, that's a shame.
        hint: This phrase focuses on hearing information and expresses sympathy, but it doesn't convey
          the speaker's personal surprise or exclamatory disbelief about the situation itself, which なんて
          does. We're looking for an expression of personal astonishment.
    scene: Two female friends gossiping about a mutual acquaintance.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The first `なんて` expresses surprise ("To think he's still single"). The second `なんて` acts as
      an exclamation ("How unlucky!"), emphasizing the unfortunate situation. This type of slightly gossipy,
      exclamatory tone is common in casual female conversation.
  - english: Things like 'I'm busy' are just excuses.
    japanese:
      - 忙しい {なんて}、ただ の 言い訳 だ よ。
      - 忙しい {なんて}、言い訳 に 過ぎ ない よ。
      - 忙しい {なんて}、言い訳 に しか なら ない。
      - 忙しい {など} は、単なる 言い訳 です。
    english_literally: '''I''m busy'' something like that, is just an excuse.'
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 忙しい と か、ただ の 言い訳 だ よ。
        english: '''I''m busy'' or something like that, is just an excuse.'
        hint: 「とか」 can list examples, but なんて carries a slightly more dismissive or surprised nuance in
          this context, implying a judgment about the example. We're looking for a phrase that lightly
          dismisses the statement.
    scene: A male manager talking to a junior male colleague who is making excuses.
    register: casual
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: '`なんて` introduces "忙しい" as a casual example of an excuse, with a slight nuance of dismissiveness.
      The phrase `〜だよ` at the end, coupled with a male speaker, gives it a direct, mildly admonishing
      tone.'
  - english: How about something like ramen for lunch?
    japanese:
      - お 昼ご飯、ラーメン {なんて} どう？
      - お 昼ご飯、ラーメン は どう？
      - お 昼ご飯、ラーメン {なんて} いかが です か？
      - ラーメン {なんて}、どう？
    english_literally: Lunch, ramen something like that, how about?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - お 昼ご飯、ラーメン は どう？
        english: How about ramen for lunch?
        hint: Omitting なんて makes the suggestion more direct and less casual or tentative. なんて softens
          the suggestion, implying 'something like' or 'just an idea.' We're looking for a casual, softer
          suggestion.
    scene: Friends deciding what to eat for lunch.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: '`なんて` here acts as a soft suggestion, implying "something like ramen" as an option. This
      is a very common and neutral usage in casual conversation.'
  - english: I can't believe he said something so rude!
    japanese:
      - 彼 が そんな 失礼 な こと を 言う {なんて}！
      - 彼 が そんな 失礼 な こと を 言う {なんて}、信じ られ ない！
      - 彼 が そんな 失礼 な こと 言う {なんて} な！
      - 彼 が そんな 失礼 な こと を 言う {なんて} ね。
    english_literally: That he says such rude things!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が そんな 失礼 な こと を 言っ た と は！
        english: He said something so rude!
        hint: 「とは」 can also express surprise or disbelief, but なんて in this context conveys a more immediate
          and often stronger emotional reaction of shock or indignation in casual speech. We're looking
          for a more spontaneous, exclamatory expression.
    scene: A person (older, gender neutral) expressing shock after overhearing a rude comment from a younger
      person.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: '`なんて` conveys strong disbelief and disapproval of the action. An older speaker might use
      this to express a sense of disappointment or shock at the perceived lack of manners.'
  - english: I saw a ghost yesterday, something like that!
    japanese:
      - 昨日、幽霊 {なんて} 見 た ん だ よ！
      - 昨日、幽霊 {なんて} 見 た ん だ！
      - 昨日、幽霊 {なんて} 見 ちゃっ た ん だ よ！
      - 昨日、幽霊 {なんて} まさか 見 た ん だ よ！
    english_literally: Yesterday, I saw something like a ghost!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昨日、幽霊 みたい な もの を 見 た ん だ よ！
        english: Yesterday, I saw something ghost-like!
        hint: 「みたいなもの」 literally means 'something like,' but it lacks the dramatic, 'can you believe it?!'
          flair that なんて adds, making the event sound more extraordinary. We're looking for an expression
          that makes the event sound more unbelievable or exciting.
    scene: A child telling an exaggerated story to their friends.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: '`なんて` is used to make the statement more dramatic or to imply that it''s an unbelievable
      or extraordinary thing that happened. The particle `〜んだよ` reinforces the child''s attempt to impress
      or convey a personal experience.'
  - english: I can't believe you hid it here!
    japanese:
      - こんな 所 に 隠し て た {なんて}！
      - こんな 所 に 隠す {なんて}！
      - こんな 所 に 隠し て た {なんて} ね！
      - こんな 所 に 隠し て た {なんて}、びっくり！
    english_literally: That you hid it in a place like this!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - こんな 所 に 隠し て い た と は！
        english: You hid it in a place like this!
        hint: While 「とは」 can convey surprise, なんて is more commonly used in casual, exclamatory contexts
          to express a feeling of exasperation or genuine surprise, particularly in personal reactions.
          We're looking for a more informal, emotionally charged expression of disbelief.
    scene: A mother (female) discovering an object hidden by her child.
    register: casual
    setting: excited
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: Expresses surprise and a bit of exasperation at the unexpected location. A mother might use
      this when finding something in an obvious or silly hiding spot, often to herself or an imagined
      audience.
  - english: It's cold today, isn't it? What do you call this cold weather?
    japanese:
      - 今日 は 寒い {なんて} 言っ て た っけ？
      - 寒い {なんて} 言っ て た っけ？
      - 今日 は 寒い {なんて}、誰 か 言っ て た か な？
      - 今日 は 寒い {なんて} 言っ た 記憶 が ある けど？
    english_literally: Today, was I saying 'it's cold' or something?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 寒い と 言っ て た っけ？
        english: Was I saying it was cold today?
        hint: Omitting なんて makes it a simple recall question without the implied nuance of 'or something
          like that,' or a slight dismissive tone about the content of the memory. We're looking for an
          expression that adds a light, uncertain, or self-correcting nuance.
    scene: Someone trying to recall what they said or thought about the weather.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: '`なんて` here is used in a self-correction or reflective inquiry, akin to "or something like
      that." The `〜っけ` particle is also key here, indicating the speaker is trying to recall information.'
