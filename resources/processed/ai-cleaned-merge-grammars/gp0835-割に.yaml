    "etymology": "「割 (wari)」 means proportion or ratio. 「に (ni)」 is a particle indicating a circumstance or condition. Therefore, 「割に」 literally means \"in proportion to\" or \"considering the proportion,\" implying a comparison against expectations.",
    "writeup": "「割に (warini)」 functions as an adverb, expressing a sense of unexpectedness or disproportion. It's similar to \"although,\" \"despite,\" or \"comparatively\" in English. It's used to highlight something that doesn't quite match what one would expect based on a certain factor. Unlike 「割と」, 「割に」 is **not** a standalone expression. It always compares something against expectations.",
