    "etymology": "The term 「割(わり)」 means \"proportion\" or \"ratio.\" The 「に」 particle indicates direction or purpose. Therefore, 「割に」 literally translates to \"in proportion to,\" but is used to express that something is disproportionate or unexpected relative to something else.",
    "writeup": "「割に」 is an adverbial phrase used to express a sense of disproportion or unexpectedness. It conveys that something is *not* as one would expect, considering a particular factor or condition. It's similar to saying \"although,\" \"despite,\" or \"rather...for\" in English.\n\nThis phrase highlights a contrast or contradiction, comparing something to expectations within its category rather than explicitly comparing it to another distinct item. It can appear at the beginning of a sentence or after the word/phrase it modifies.\n\nWhen connecting to a noun, use 「の」. When connecting to a な-adjective, use 「な」. For い-adjectives and verbs, use their plain forms directly before 「割に」.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid mixing 「割に」 with similar expressions, remember that 「割に」 specifically highlights a disproportionate relationship or unexpectedness based on a known factor within the same category. For example, if something is expensive but low quality, 「割に」 is suitable because it contrasts the expected quality with the actual quality. In contrast, 「にしては」 emphasizes the degree of unexpectedness and can set a comparative standard, 「に比べて」 makes explicit comparisons between different entities, 「さえ」 emphasizes an extreme case, 「ものの」 introduces a simple contrasting idea, 「むしろ」 expresses a preference or correction, and 「割と」 is a general adverb for 'comparatively' or 'unexpectedly' without the strong sense of disproportionality tied to a preceding clause.",
