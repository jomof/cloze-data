jlpt: N5
etymology: The adjective 「欲しい」 (hoshii) is believed to have originated from the verb 「欲す (hosu)」, meaning
  "to desire," with the addition of 「-しい (-shii)」 creating its adjectival form. The particle 「が」 marks
  the object of this desire, reflecting how Japanese i-adjectives directly convey states like wanting
  or needing, with the object being the subject of that state.
writeup: |-
  The Japanese adjective 「**欲しい (hoshii)**」 is used to express one's desire to **have** or **possess** a noun or an abstract concept. It functions grammatically like any other い-adjective. The item desired is marked by the particle 「が」, and the person who wants the item is the subject of the sentence, often marked by 「は」 or 「が」.

  While 「欲しい」 primarily conveys the speaker's personal desires, it can appear in quoted speech or questions about others' desires. However, when describing someone else's apparent desires as an observation, the verb 「**欲しがる (hoshigaru)**」 is typically used. For instance, you would say 「彼 は 新しい 車 を 欲し がっ て いる」 (He seems to want a new car) if you are observing his behavior.

  It is crucial to distinguish 「欲しい」 from similar expressions:
  *   **「〜たい」**: This form is used to express a desire to **perform an action** (a verb), not to have a thing. For example, 「寿司 を 食べたい」 means "I want to eat sushi," focusing on the action of eating.
  *   **「〜てほしい」**: This construction is used when you want **another person to perform an action** for you. For example, 「手伝っ て ほしい」 means "I want you to help me."
  *   **「〜ように〜てほしい」**: This is similar to 「〜てほしい」 but specifically emphasizes the *manner* or *way* in which an action should be done, or for a *state* to be achieved. For example, 「早く 帰っ て ほしい」 (I want you to come home quickly).

  「欲しい」 can be made polite by adding 「です」 (e.g., 「欲しいです」). Like all い-adjectives, it conjugates to express negative, past, and conditional forms.

  - term: たい
    meaning: Want to do (action)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「Nounが欲しい」 expresses a desire to have a noun (thing or concept), 「〜たい」 expresses a desire
      to do an action, attaching directly to a verb stem.
    grammar_point: たい (want to do)
  - term: '[i-Adj-stem]がる・[na-Adj]がる'
    meaning: To show signs of feeling; to want (for someone else)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「Nounが欲しい」 expresses the speaker's own desire. 「〜がる」 (and its action-focused variant 「〜たがる」)
      is used to describe someone else's apparent desire or inclination, often based on observation, as
      it's an observable behavior.
    grammar_point: '[い-Adjective-stem]がる・[な-Adjective]がる (to show signs of feeling)'
  - term: '[Verb-て]ほしい'
    meaning: To want someone to do (action)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「Nounが欲しい」 is for wanting a noun. 「〜てほしい」 is used when you want another person to perform
      an action for you.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-て]ほしい (to want someone to do)'
  - term: ように〜てほしい
    meaning: To want someone to act in a certain way; to want something to happen in a certain way
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This expression is similar to 「〜てほしい」 but specifically emphasizes the manner or way in which
      an action should be done, or for a state to be achieved.
    grammar_point: ように〜てほしい (want someone to act in a certain way)
post_false_friends_writeup: To ensure correct usage, remember that 「Nounが欲しい」 is specifically for desiring
  tangible or intangible **things** (nouns). If you wish to express a desire to **perform an action**,
  use 「〜たい」. If you are talking about **someone else's desires** based on your observation, use the 「〜がる」
  form. Lastly, when you want **someone else to do something for you**, use 「〜てほしい」, and if you're specifying
  *how* you want it done, use 「〜ように〜てほしい」.

    scene: A teacher addressing their students at the beginning of a new term, offering support.
    register: formal

    nuance: The conditional 「ほしければ」 emphasizes that the request for help is dependent on the listener's
      desire, making the offer of assistance conditional but open.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, 「Nounが欲しい」 is versatile, applying to both concrete
  items and abstract concepts. While it primarily conveys the speaker's desire, it's also used in questions
  or when quoting someone else's stated desire. Always consider whether the desired item is a noun (use
  「が欲しい」) or an action (use 「〜たい」) for accurate expression.
