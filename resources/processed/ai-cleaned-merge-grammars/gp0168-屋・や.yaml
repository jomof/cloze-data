    "writeup": "The suffix 「屋・や」 is attached to nouns to denote a type of shop, store, or a person's occupation. For example, 「本屋 (hon'ya)」 means \"bookstore,\" and 「魚屋 (sakana'ya)」 means \"fish shop.\" However, it can also be used in a derogatory sense to describe someone who is excessively or single-mindedly focused on a particular activity, like 「政治屋 (seiji'ya)」, meaning a \"mere politician\" or someone overly involved in politics for personal gain. It is important to understand the context to interpret its meaning correctly.",
