    "formation": {
        "[Noun] + 屋": "Indicates a type of shop, occupation, or sometimes a derogatory term."
    },
    "jlpt": "N4",
    "meaning": "Shop; Store; Occupation",
    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "suffix",
        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "Attached to nouns to indicate a type of shop or the profession of someone. Sometimes used in a derogatory way to describe someone overly involved in a particular field, implying a lack of integrity or genuine purpose.",
        "nuance": "While commonly used to denote a shop or a person's occupation, the suffix can carry a negative, disparaging nuance when applied to people in certain contexts, suggesting they are merely 'in it for the business' or are overly focused on a single aspect without broader virtue. This derogatory usage is more common for professions that traditionally imply dedication or public service, such as 'politician' or 'scholar'."
    },
    "etymology": "The kanji 屋 (ya) literally means \"house\" or \"roof.\" Over time, it came to be associated with places of business or shops, as many early businesses were conducted from homes or under a specific roof. It evolved into a suffix indicating the type of establishment or the profession conducted there. The derogatory use is a more recent development, drawing on the idea of someone being 'just a shopkeeper' or 'just a professional' with no deeper meaning or integrity.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「屋・や」 is attached to nouns to denote a type of shop, store, or a person's occupation. For example, 「本屋 (hon'ya)」 means \"bookstore,\" and 「魚屋 (sakana'ya)」 means \"fish shop.\" This usage is widespread and generally neutral.\n\nHowever, 「屋・や」 can also be used in a derogatory sense, implying that someone is excessively or single-mindedly focused on a particular activity, often for personal gain or without genuine depth. For instance, 「政治屋 (seiji'ya)」 refers to a \"mere politician\" or someone overly involved in politics for personal gain, contrasting with 「政治家 (seijika)」 which implies a statesman. Similarly, 「学屋 (gaku'ya)」 might refer to someone who is merely a bookworm or academic without true understanding or contribution. It is crucial to understand the context to interpret its meaning correctly, especially when applied to people.",

                    "mitigation": "The phrase “駅前 の 本 {屋} に 行き ます” implies a more common, everyday establishment, which is the nuance of 本屋 over the more formal 書店. The scene suggests a regular, casual activity, making 本屋 a more natural fit."

            "register": "teineigo (polite)",
            "setting": "informative",
            "nuance": "The use of 「本屋」 (hon'ya) is the most common and natural way to refer to a bookstore in everyday conversation, implying a familiar, often smaller, local shop, as opposed to the more formal 「書店」 (shoten), which can refer to a larger, more commercial book retailer. The polite verb ending 「〜ます」 (masu) maintains a respectful tone."

The term 「魚商人」 (sakana shōnin) is much more formal and less commonly used, making it less appropriate for a casual, appreciative comment from a customer. The scene of a customer praising their local shop reinforces the familiarity and common usage of 魚屋."

            "register": "teineigo (polite)",
            "setting": "friendly",
            "nuance": "Adding 「さん」 (san) to 「魚屋」 (sakana'ya) makes it a respectful and familiar way to refer to the person who runs the fish shop. The phrase 「用意してくれ ます」 (yōi shite kuremasu) expresses gratitude for the effort they put in, highlighting a positive relationship between customer and vendor."

The use of 「医者 と いう より も、 ただ の」 (isha to iu yori mo, tada no), meaning 'less of a doctor and more just a...', clearly sets up the negative comparison, making 「薬屋」 the appropriate choice to convey the sense of someone who just sells drugs, without genuine medical care."

This kind of critical judgment is often expressed in casual settings."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The suffix 「屋・や」 can indeed be tricky. While its primary use is to name shops or occupations, its occasional derogatory application, particularly to individuals, requires careful attention to context. Words like 「政治家」 (politician/statesman) and 「学者」 (scholar) are neutral and often respectful terms. When 「屋」 is affixed to create 「政治屋」 or 「学屋」, it often strips away that respect, implying someone who is merely 'in the business of' politics or academia without genuine dedication or integrity. The key is to recognize the shift from naming a profession or establishment to implicitly criticizing the person's character or motivation within that profession.",
