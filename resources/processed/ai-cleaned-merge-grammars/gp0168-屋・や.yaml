        "part-of-speech": "suffix",
        "usage-context": "Attached to nouns to indicate a type of shop or the profession of someone. Sometimes used in a derogatory way to describe someone overly involved in a particular field, implying a lack of integrity or genuine purpose.",
        "nuance": "While commonly used to denote a shop or a person's occupation, the suffix can carry a negative, disparaging nuance when applied to people in certain contexts, suggesting they are merely 'in it for the business' or are overly focused on a single aspect without broader virtue. This derogatory usage is more common for professions that traditionally imply dedication or public service, such as 'politician' or 'scholar'.",
        "source": "https://bunpro.jp/grammar_points/屋・や"
    },
    "etymology": "The kanji 屋 (ya) literally means \"house\" or \"roof.\" Over time, it came to be associated with places of business or shops, as many early businesses were conducted from homes or under a specific roof. It evolved into a suffix indicating the type of establishment or the profession conducted there. The derogatory use is a more recent development, drawing on the idea of someone being 'just a shopkeeper' or 'just a professional' with no deeper meaning or integrity.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「屋・や」 is attached to nouns to denote a type of shop, store, or a person's occupation. For example, 「本屋 (hon'ya)」 means \"bookstore,\" and 「魚屋 (sakana'ya)」 means \"fish shop.\" This usage is widespread and generally neutral.\n\nHowever, 「屋・や」 can also be used in a derogatory sense, implying that someone is excessively or single-mindedly focused on a particular activity, often for personal gain or without genuine depth. For instance, 「政治屋 (seiji'ya)」 refers to a \"mere politician\" or someone overly involved in politics for personal gain, contrasting with 「政治家 (seijika)」 which implies a statesman. Similarly, 「学屋 (gaku'ya)」 might refer to someone who is merely a bookworm or academic without true understanding or contribution. It is crucial to understand the context to interpret its meaning correctly, especially when applied to people.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The suffix 「屋・や」 can indeed be tricky. While its primary use is to name shops or occupations, its occasional derogatory application, particularly to individuals, requires careful attention to context. Words like 「政治家」 (politician/statesman) and 「学者」 (scholar) are neutral and often respectful terms. When 「屋」 is affixed to create 「政治屋」 or 「学屋」, it often strips away that respect, implying someone who is merely 'in the business of' politics or academia without genuine dedication or integrity. Similarly, when referring to shops, more formal terms like 「書店」 or 「洋菓子店」 exist. The key is to recognize the shift from naming a profession or establishment to implicitly criticizing the person's character or motivation within that profession, or understanding the register and nuance of the shop name.",
