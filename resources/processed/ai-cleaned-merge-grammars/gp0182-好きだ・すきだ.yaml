It's crucial to remember that 「好きだ」 is a **な-adjective**, which affects how it connects to nouns and other grammatical elements. The basic structure is Subject + は + Object + が + 好きだ/です. Using 「を」 instead of 「が」 is a common mistake. Also, 「大好き」 means \"to really like\" or \"to love,\" indicating a strong preference.",
