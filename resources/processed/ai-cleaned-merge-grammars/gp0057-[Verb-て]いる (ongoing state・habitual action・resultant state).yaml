  pronunciation_warning: The 「いる」 part of 「ている」 is often contracted to 「る」 in casual speech. This applies
    to all conjugations, e.g., 「います」 to 「ます」, 「いて」 to 「って」, 「いた」 to 「た」.
formation:
  Verb (て-form) + いる: Expresses an ongoing action, a state of being resulting from an action, or a habitual/repeated
    activity.
  Verb (て-form) + いる + 状態/状況: Used to explicitly state that the resultant state is ongoing, adding emphasis
    to the continuing condition. For example, 「開いている状態」 (a state of being open).
  Verb in te-form + いる/います: Indicates a habitual action or repeated activity.
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: General everyday usage to describe an action in progress, a state resulting from a completed
    action or change, or a habitual/repeated activity.
  function: To indicate an ongoing action, a resultant state where an action has occurred and its effect
    or condition persists, or an action performed habitually or repeatedly over a period.
  nuance: Distinguishes ongoing actions from single events, highlights the current condition resulting
    from a completed action (especially for instantaneous change verbs), and emphasizes the regularity
    or long-term nature of an action.
  grammatical-role: Functions as an auxiliary verb, attaching to the te-form of a main verb to modify
    its aspect from an action to a state or habit. It transforms a transitive or intransitive verb describing
    a change into an expression of the current condition after that change has taken place, or signifies
    an action's repetition.
  temporal-flow: Describes an action currently in progress, a state that began in the past (due to a completed
    action) and continues up to the present moment, or a repeated action that occurs regularly over a
    period in the past, present, or future.
  spatial-flow: Often associated with verbs of movement, indicating the continuous nature of movement
    or the resulting state of a movement (e.g., 「座っている」 - 'is sitting').
etymology: The grammar point 「ている」 is a combination of the 「て」-form of a verb, which indicates a manner
  or state, and the verb 「いる」, meaning 'to exist' or 'to be'. Therefore, literally, 「ている」 means 'to exist
  in the state of doing something'. This etymology reflects its function of describing ongoing actions
  or existing states resulting from actions. Historically, this structure signified "to be in the state
  of having completed an action." Over time, its meaning broadened to encompass actions currently in progress
  and, as seen here, habitual or repetitive actions. The core concept remains that of "existing in a particular
  state"—in this case, the state of repeatedly performing an action. This evolution allows 「ている」 to convey
  ongoing existence, completion leading to a state, or persistent activity, all stemming from the fundamental
  meaning of 「いる」.
writeup: |-
  The 「ている」 form in Japanese is a versatile and fundamental grammatical structure used to express three primary aspects: **ongoing actions**, **resultant states**, and **habitual actions**. Understanding the context and the nature of the main verb is crucial to discerning its precise meaning.

  *   **Ongoing Actions:** This indicates that an action is currently happening. It is often compared to the "~ing" form in English. For example, 「食べている」 means "is eating." This usage focuses on the process of an action as it unfolds.

  *   **Resultant States:** This describes a state that continues to exist as a result of a previously completed action. This applies particularly to verbs that describe an instantaneous action or a change, where the focus is on the state after the action's completion. For instance, 「結婚する」 (to marry) becomes 「結婚している」 (is married – the state of having married). Similarly, 「ドアが開いている」 means "the door is open" (the state resulting from the door having opened), not "the door is opening."

  *   **Habitual Actions:** When combined with words indicating frequency like `いつも` (always), `毎日` (every day), or `よく` (often), 「ている」 can also indicate a continuous or habitual action, rather than a specific action happening at a particular moment. This conveys the sense of "doing [verb] regularly" or "being in the habit of doing [verb]."

  This form is created by attaching 「いる」 to the *te-* form of a verb. While the base form of `いる` is plain, its use in `ている` is adaptable to various registers depending on the ending (e.g., `います` for polite). In casual speech, 「いる」 is often contracted to 「る」, resulting in forms like 「てる」, 「てて」, 「てた」, and 「てます」. Be aware that some verbs, like 「死ぬ」 (to die) and 「知る」 (to get to know), appear in the 「ている」 form to describe a state, which might be translated into the past tense in English. For example, 「死んでいる」 means "is dead" (the state of having died) and 「知っている」 means "knows" (the state of having come to know).

  **Important Considerations:**
  *   For **resultant states**, this form is most commonly used with verbs that denote an instantaneous change, where the action's completion leads to a new, continuing state. Examples include verbs like 開く (to open), 閉まる (to close), 始まる (to begin), 終わる (to end), 結婚する (to marry), 死ぬ (to die), 忘れる (to forget), 太る (to get fat), 痩せる (to get thin), etc.
  *   The primary focus for resultant states is on the *current condition* or state, not the process of change.
  *   For **habitual actions**, to emphasize the nature of the action, you will frequently find 「ている」 used with expressions of time such as **毎日** (every day), **毎晩** (every night), **毎週** (every week), **いつも** (always), or **普段** (usually). This highlights that the action is a consistent part of someone's life or a regular occurrence.

  - term: Verb+て
    meaning: And, Then (Linking events)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While the Verb + て form can link actions sequentially, {ている} specifically describes an ongoing
      action, a resultant state, or a habitual action. It is not merely a connector of events.
    grammar_point: Verb[て] (and then)
  - term: ているところだ
    meaning: In the process of doing ~ right now/at this moment
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: '{ているところだ} emphasizes an action happening at this very moment or about to begin, conveying
      a sense of immediacy that {ている} alone does not always carry. While {ている} can indicate an ongoing
      action, adding ところだ specifies that it''s occurring *right now*.'
    grammar_point: '[Verb-て]いるところだ (in the process of doing)'
  - term: ているあいだに
    meaning: While, During the time that ~
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '{ているあいだに} signifies an action occurring *during* the span of another ongoing activity, whereas
      {ている} simply describes the ongoing action or state itself.'
    grammar_point: あいだ (between・among・while・during)
  - term: てある
    meaning: Something is done, Has been done, Remaining state
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While {ている} can describe a resultant state (e.g., ドアが開いている - the door is open), {てある} specifically
      implies that the action was performed intentionally, and the state exists because of that preparation
      or intentional act (e.g., ドアが開けてある - The door has been opened by someone, for a purpose).
    grammar_point: てある (resultant state)
  - term: つづける
    meaning: To continue
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While {ている} can indicate a continuous or habitual action, {つづける} emphasizes the continuous
      nature of the *action itself* and its progression, rather than the resulting state or simply the
      habit. It implies an action that keeps going without interruption.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]つづける (to continue doing)'
  - term: まま
    meaning: As is; unchanged; while still; leaving something as it is.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '{まま} describes a state where something remains *unchanged* from a previous condition or a
      state in which something is left. Unlike {ている} which emphasizes the result of a completed action
      or an ongoing action/habit, {まま} often implies a lack of action or a continuous, static state without
      necessarily being the *result* of a specific verb''s completion. For example, 「電気をつけたまま寝た」 (I slept
      with the lights left on).'
    grammar_point: まま (as is)
  - term: ものだ
    meaning: Indicates something is natural, expected, or supposed to be a certain way.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While {ている} describes a consistent, repeated behavior or ongoing state, {ものだ} expresses a
      general truth, a strong expectation, or a nostalgic habit from the past that may no longer be current.
      It focuses on the inherent nature of something or a past routine, not a presently active, ongoing
      habit or current state.
    grammar_point: ものだ (general truth expectation)
post_false_friends_writeup: To distinguish 「ている」 from similar expressions, consider the specific nuance.
  If the focus is on a momentary action happening *right now*, 「ているところだ」 is more appropriate. If it's
  about an action occurring *during* another event, use 「ているあいだに」. For a state resulting from an *intentional*
  action or preparation, 「てある」 is used. When emphasizing the continuous *progression* of an action, 「つづける」
  is preferred. If something remains *unchanged* from a prior condition, 「まま」 is the fit. Lastly, 「ものだ」
  expresses general truths or past habits rather than current actions or states.

    nuance: The sentence-final particle 「な」 (pronounced with a rising intonation) is a common male speech
      marker used to express a mild exclamation or observation, often seeking implicit agreement. The
      additional 「はる」 is a regional dialect (Kansai-ben) often used by older male speakers to express

          - 子ども の 時、かぞく と りょこう に {行っ て い まし た}。
        english: When I was a child, I was going on a trip with my family (on that day).
        hint: Without the clear indication of repetition like 「まいしゅう」 (every week), 「行っていました」 could mean
          the action was ongoing at a specific point in the past. This example specifies a repeated, habitual
          action.
    scene: An older man reminisces with his grandchild about his youth.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: storytelling

    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The male speaker uses polite but accessible language when speaking to a younger family member,
      showing respect while sharing personal memories. The politeness of 「行っていました」 is appropriate for
      a more formal or semi-formal storytelling context within a family.

        english: She didn't walk outside every morning before.
        hint: 「あるきませんでした」 simply states a past non-event. 「あるいて{いませんでした}」 specifically implies that a
          past habitual action (walking outside every morning) was not occurring regularly for a period,
          emphasizing the absence of the routine in the past.
      - competing_japanese:
          - かのじょ は その 時 外 を あるい て {い ませ ん でし た}。
        english: She was not walking outside at that time.

        english: If you practice every day, your singing will improve.
        hint: 「すれば」 suggests a general condition. 「していれば」 emphasizes that the *habit* of daily practice
          is the condition for improvement, making the advice about consistent effort rather than a one-time
          act.
      - competing_japanese:
          - もし、今 れんしゅう を {し て いれ ば}、すぐ に じょうず に なる よ。
        english: If you are practicing right now, you will improve quickly.
        hint: 「していれば」 can refer to an action ongoing in the present as a condition. With 「毎日」 (every day),
          it emphasizes the *habit* of daily practice as the condition for improvement.
    scene: A kind music teacher encourages a student who is struggling with their singing.
    register: casual
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「よ」 at the end of the sentence and the kind, encouraging tone suggest an older

      particle 「よ」.

          - もし 毎日 からだ を {うごかし たら}、もっと げんき だっ た だろう ね。
        english: If you had exercised every day, you probably would have been healthier.
        hint: 「うごかしたら」 suggests a single instance of action. 「うごかして{いたら}」 clearly refers to a hypothetical
          habitual action that was not taken in the past, emphasizing the continuous nature of the missed
          practice and its long-term effects. It sets up a counterfactual scenario about a routine.

        english: If you were exercising at that time, you probably would have been healthier.
        hint: 「うごかして{いたら}」 can refer to an action ongoing at a specific point in the past as a hypothetical
          condition. The presence of 「毎日」 (every day) signifies that the condition is about a habitual
          action.
    scene: A coach talks to a former player who expresses regret about not training harder in the past.
    register: casual
    setting: supportive

    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The coach uses 「ね」 at the end to soften the advice and 「だろう」 to indicate a hypothetical outcome,
      common for an older male mentor guiding a younger male player with empathy. The casual register
      is conveyed through the use of 「ね」.

        english: That man wakes up early every day and is healthy.
        hint: 「起きて」 simply links two actions. 「起きていて」 implies a sustained state (waking up early) that
          results in another state (being healthy), emphasizing the continuous consequence of the habitual
          action. It highlights how the routine directly leads to a continuous outcome.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 男 の 人 は 今、はやく {起き て い て}、げんき だ。
        english: That man is waking up early right now, and he's healthy.
        hint: 「起きていて」 can describe an action ongoing at the current moment leading to a state. With 「毎日」
          (every day), it emphasizes the habitual action of waking up early and its continuous effect.
    scene: A friend describes a disciplined person's daily habits and their positive outcome.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
post_example_writeup: The versatility of 「ている」 allows it to express both ongoing actions, continuous states
  resulting from a past action, and habitual actions. Understanding the context and the nature of the
  verb is key to discerning its precise meaning. Pay close attention to the type of verb and the desired
  emphasis to correctly use or interpret this versatile form. Remember that habitual actions often involve
  time expressions such as 「いつも」 (always), 「毎日」 (every day), 「毎晩」 (every night), etc. The key is that
  the action is repeated regularly, making it a habitual part of life.
