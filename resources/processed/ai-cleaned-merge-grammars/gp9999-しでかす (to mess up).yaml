pronunciation:
  katakana: シデカス
  romaji: shidekasu
formation:
  '[Subject が] + [Object を] + しでかす': Used when a subject actively causes a negative outcome to an object.
  '[Subject が] + しでかす': Used when the subject is responsible for a blunder, without a specified direct
    object.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The verb 「しでかす」 (shidekasu) is formed from the verb 「為る」 (suru, to do) in its 連用形 (ren'yōkei,
  continuative form) 「し」, and 「出かす」 (dekasu), which means to do something thoroughly or to bring something
  about. Originally, 「出かす」 could mean to accomplish something, but over time, especially in combination
  with 「し」, it developed a strong connotation of doing something *completely* wrong or *thoroughly* messing
  something up. This suggests that the action is not just a minor mistake, but a significant, often noticeable,
  blunder.
writeup: |-
  The verb 「しでかす」 (shidekasu) is used to describe the act of **making a significant mistake, committing a blunder, or screwing something up**, often with negative consequences. It implies an action that results in an undesirable outcome, frequently due to carelessness, incompetence, or a lack of foresight. While it can translate simply as 'to mess up' or 'to bungle', it often carries a stronger nuance of a substantial or embarrassing error compared to more general terms like 「間違える」 (machigaeru, to make a mistake) or 「失敗する」 (shippai suru, to fail).

  It is typically used for actions that actively *cause* a problem or ruin a situation. For instance, if someone forgets an important document for a meeting, they might be said to have 「しでかした」 (shidekashita). The term suggests a degree of culpability or direct involvement in the negative outcome.

  「しでかす」 is generally used in casual to semi-formal contexts. It implies a direct action leading to a negative result. It can be used by both men and women, and across different age groups, but its slightly direct and impactful nature means it is less likely to be found in highly polite or formal business language where more indirect or humble expressions for mistakes would be preferred.

    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Very close in meaning to 「しでかす」, often used for significant blunders. 「やらかす」 is generally
      more casual, sometimes implies something done mischievously or carelessly with a touch of exasperation
      from the speaker. 「しでかす」 often implies a more serious or objective about the blunder.

    kind: similar expression

      implies the *act* of making the blunder, 「台無しにする」 describes the state of ruin.

post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  While 「しでかす」, 「失敗する」, 「間違える」, 「やらかす」, and 「台無しにする」 all relate to errors or negative outcomes, their nuances differ significantly. 「失敗する」 is a general term for 'to fail' and can apply to anything from not achieving a goal to making a small error. 「間違える」 simply means 'to make a mistake' or 'to be wrong', often referring to an an incorrect answer or action without necessarily implying severe consequences.

  「やらかす」 is very similar to 「しでかす」; both refer to making a significant blunder. However, 「やらかす」 tends to be more informal and can sometimes carry a slightly playful or exasperated tone, as if acknowledging a mischief or a predictable screw-up. 「しでかす」 often suggests a more serious or impactful blunder, an action that truly 'messed things up'.

  Finally, 「台無しにする」 focuses on the *result* of the action – something has been ruined or spoiled. You might 「しでかす」 something (the action) which then causes it to be 「台無しになる」 (the state of being ruined). Understanding these distinctions will help you choose the most appropriate expression.
