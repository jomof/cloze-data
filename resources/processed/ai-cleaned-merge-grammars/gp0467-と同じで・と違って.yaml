    "etymology": "「と同じで」 comes from 「と」 (particle indicating comparison), 「同じ」 (same), and 「で」 (the te-form of the copula 「だ」). 「と違って」 comes from 「と」 (particle indicating comparison) and 「違って」 (the te-form of the verb 「違う」 - to differ).",
    "writeup": "The grammar points 「と同じで」 and 「と違って」 are used to express similarity and dissimilarity, respectively. 「と同じで」 means \"the same as (A)\" or \"like (A),\" while 「と違って」 means \"different from (A)\" or \"unlike (A).\" In both structures, the particle 「と」 marks (A), the item being compared. 「同じ」 is a noun, so it requires the copula 「だ」 (in its te-form, 「で」) to link it to the preceding noun. 「違う」 is a verb, and 「違って」 is its te-form, indicating a state of difference. Both expressions state that (B) exists in a state of 'having sameness' or 'having difference' with (A).",
