        "[Verb/Adjective (plain form)] + のは + [Noun/Adjective]": "Transforms the preceding verb or adjective phrase into a noun phrase that can act as the subject, object, or complement of a sentence."

    "etymology": "The の part nominalizes the verb or adjective that precedes it. The は part marks the newly nominalized phrase as the topic of the sentence, drawing attention to it.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「のは」 functions as a **nominalizer**, transforming a verb phrase or clause into a noun-like element. Think of it as turning a verb into 'the act of' or describing 'the one who' performs an action. 「のは」 highlights the phrase preceding it as the **topic** of the sentence, similar to 「は」 itself. It can be used to emphasize or clarify what the speaker is focusing on. Importantly, 「のは」 cannot be used with the polite forms 「ます」 or 「ません」. It also isn't interchangeable with 「こと」 in set phrases.",
