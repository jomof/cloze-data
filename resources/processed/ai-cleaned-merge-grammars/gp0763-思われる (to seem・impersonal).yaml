jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  register: formal
  usage-context: Indicates a degree of uncertainty or subjectivity in the speaker's assessment, often
    used to soften definitive statements.
  function: To express an opinion, judgment, or impression in a formal or polite way, conveying a sense
    of objectivity or detachment.
  nuance: A more polite and indirect way of expressing one's opinion compared to 「思う」, suitable for formal
    reports, academic writing, or polite conversation where certainty is not absolute or where the speaker
    wishes to avoid strong personal assertion.
  colocation: Often appears with adverbs indicating degree or manner, such as 「強く」 (strongly), 「確かに」 (certainly),
    or 「いかにも」 (truly/as if).
  grammatical-role: Functions as a main verb, taking a subject that is 'thought' or 'appears' in a certain
    way, or as an impersonal expression where the subject is implied or general.
  logical-flow: Presents a conclusion or observation that is logically inferred rather than directly stated,
    allowing for a more nuanced or tentative assertion.
  temporal-flow: Can be used in present (to seem/be thought now) or past tense (to have seemed/be thought),
    indicating the time frame of the observation or common belief.
  spatial-flow: Less directly related to physical space, but can describe how something appears or is
    considered within a conceptual space or context (e.g., in the academic world, in the eyes of the public).
etymology: 「思われる」 is derived from the verb 「思う」 (omou), meaning "to think" or "to feel," and the passive/potential
  auxiliary verb 「れる」 (reru). The combination creates a passive form that conveys the sense of something
  being 'thought' or 'to be considered' in a more objective or impersonal way. It can also be interpreted
  as a potential form, meaning "can be thought," which leads to the nuance of "it seems" or "it appears."
  In classical Japanese, 「思わる」 existed with both passive and spontaneous meanings, which naturally evolved
  into its modern usage of expressing objective appearance or consensus.
writeup: "「思われる」 is a crucial expression used to convey an opinion, judgment, or impression in a formal\
  \ or polite manner. It inherently carries a nuance of uncertainty or subjectivity, making it ideal for\
  \ situations where one wishes to avoid presenting information as an absolute, definitive fact. This\
  \ indirectness serves to soften the tone of a statement, which is particularly valued in Japanese communication,\
  \ especially in writing or formal speech.\n\nWhile 「思う」 is a direct way to express \"I think,\" 「思われる」\
  \ functions more like \"it is thought that...\" or \"it seems that...\" This impersonal quality makes\
  \ it suitable for situations where the speaker or writer is presenting a general observation, a perceived\
  \ consensus, or a conclusion drawn from available information without claiming absolute certainty. It's\
  \ often used in academic papers, business reports, news articles, and formal presentations.\n\nTwo primary\
  \ patterns are common: \n*   **〜ように思われる**: This pattern (Verb/い-Adjective plain form + ように, な-Adjective\
  \ stem + な/だった + ように, Noun + の/だった + ように) suggests an impression or appearance. It's used when something\
  \ 'looks' or 'seems' a certain way based on observation or perception. For example, 「彼 は 忙しい ように 思われる」\
  \ (He seems busy).\n*   **〜と思われる**: This pattern (Plain form sentence + と) is used to express an impersonal\
  \ thought or widely held belief about a statement. It's often employed when stating a conclusion or\
  \ a general understanding, as if the thought naturally arises or is commonly accepted. For instance,\
  \ 「この 計画 は 成功 する と 思われる」 (This plan is thought to succeed).\n\nCompared to 「思う」, 「思われる」 is distinctly\
  \ more formal and indirect. While 「思う」 is versatile and can be used in casual conversation, 「思われる」 elevates\
  \ the politeness and formality of the expression, making it a preferred choice in more formal contexts."
false_friends:
  - term: 思う
    meaning: to think
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「思われる」, 「思う」 is more direct and less formal. It explicitly expresses the speaker's
      personal thoughts or opinions and is suitable for casual as well as some formal settings when expressing
      one's own viewpoint.
    grammar_point: と思う (I think or thought)
  - term: 見える
    meaning: to appear; to be visible
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While both can mean 'to appear,' 「見える」 refers to something being visually apparent or perceptible
      to the senses (e.g., physically seen or heard), whereas 「思われる」 refers to something appearing to
      be true or a certain way in one's mind or based on inference.
    grammar_point: 見える (to be visible・to seem)
  - term: ようだ
    meaning: it seems; it appears (based on observation/evidence)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ようだ」 also expresses appearance or seeming, similar to 「〜ように思われる」. However, 「ようだ」 is generally
      less formal and more conversational than 「思われる」, and it often implies a more direct observation
      or a stronger inference from evidence. 「思われる」 maintains a more detached, impersonal, and often more
      formal tone.
    grammar_point: 〜ようだ・〜みたいだ (seems・like)
  - term: らしい
    meaning: appears to be; it seems; I’ve heard that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「らしい」 indicates that something appears to be true based on available evidence or hearsay.
      While similar to 「思われる」 in conveying an impression, 「らしい」 is typically less formal and more about
      an external observation or report, whereas 「思われる」 often implies a more reasoned, impersonal conclusion
      or a general consensus.
    grammar_point: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)'
  - term: そう
    meaning: looks like; seems like
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「そう」 describes an appearance based on direct sensory observation (often visual). For example,
      「美味しそう」 (looks delicious). 「思われる」, on the other hand, describes a mental impression, a thought,
      or a general consensus, not necessarily a direct visual observation.
    grammar_point: 〜そうだ (appearance)
  - term: とされている
    meaning: is considered; is thought to be
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both 「思われる」 and 「とされている」 can convey "to be thought" or "to be considered". However, 「とされている」
      implies a more established or widely accepted notion, often akin to a consensus or a designated
      status, and is typically used for facts or accepted theories. 「思われる」 is more about an impression
      or a personal, albeit impersonalized, conclusion that might still contain a degree of uncertainty.
    grammar_point: とされている (is considered)
  - term: とみえる
    meaning: It seems that; it appears that; one can conclude that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「思われる」 and 「とみえる」 convey that something 'seems' to be the case, 「とみえる」 implies
      that this conclusion is drawn from direct observation or tangible evidence, making the appearance
      more factual or evidential. 「思われる」 can be a more general, sometimes less evidentially grounded,
      impression or a formally presented thought.
    grammar_point: とみえる (seems from observation)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between 「思われる」, 「思う」, 「見える」, 「ようだ」, 「らしい」, 「そう」, 「とされている」,
  and 「とみえる」, consider the degree of formality and the nature of the perception. Use 「思われる」 when you wish
  to express an opinion or observation politely and impersonally, implying a collective understanding
  or a reasoned conclusion rather than a strong personal assertion. 「思う」 is for direct personal thoughts.
  「見える」 is for sensory perception. 「ようだ」 and 「らしい」 are for expressions of seeming based on observation
  or hearsay, with 「らしい」 often being less formal. 「そう」 is for direct visual appearance. 「とされている」 is for
  established or widely accepted notions. 「とみえる」 is for conclusions drawn from direct, observable evidence.

    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male

      information in a formal office setting without expressing a subjective opinion. This level of formality
      is common in business Japanese.
  - english: This project seems to cost too much.
    japanese:

    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: By using 「思われる」, the speaker frames the high cost as an objective assessment or a widely held
      concern, rather than a personal complaint, fitting a serious business discussion. This allows for
      polite but firm communication.

    register: semi-formal
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male

      a personal thought. This usage is common when reflecting on events in a slightly detached, analytical
      manner.

    japanese:
      - 最近、彼女 は とても 幸せ な {よう に 思わ れ ます}。

          polite conversation.
    scene: Two friends discreetly discussing a mutual acquaintance, maintaining a polite and slightly
      detached observation.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The polite form 「思われます」 softens the statement, making it a gentle observation rather than
      a direct assertion, which is appropriate for a casual yet polite conversation between friends.

    japanese:

    scene: Someone remembering a particularly well-behaved child, expressing a widely held impression.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male

    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male

    nuance: For a meteorologist, using 「思われる」 rather than 「思う」 establishes an objective and authoritative

      which is suitable for public information.

        english: I didn't think yesterday's test was that difficult.

          consensus or common perception, not just your individual opinion.
    scene: Students discussing a recent exam, expressing a nuanced opinion that contrasts with a general
      expectation.
    register: casual
    setting: academic
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The negative past plain form 「思われなかった」 implies that the general consensus or common perception

        english: I heard that he is currently working on an important project.
        hint: 「と聞いている」 emphasizes that you received this information from someone else. We're looking
          for a statement about a general understanding or common assumption within a group, not just
          reported information.
    scene: Colleagues discussing a busy senior team member's current assignments, stating a widely held
      assumption.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    speaker_gender: male

        english: I think the new policy will bring about significant changes.
        hint: 「思う」 expresses a personal belief. We are looking for a statement conveying a general, objective
          assessment or widespread belief, often seen in formal reports or news.
    scene: A news anchor reporting on the potential impacts of a recently announced government policy.

          - パーティー で 彼女 は 少し 不安 {そう だっ た}。
        english: She looked a bit uneasy at the party.
        hint: 「〜そうだった」 directly describes an outward appearance based on visual observation. We are looking
          for a statement that describes an impression or perception about her emotional state, which
          is more internal and less directly observable.
    scene: Two friends casually discussing a mutual acquaintance after a social gathering, sharing their
      observations about her demeanor.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「思われた」 here emphasizes that the uneasiness was an impression or feeling perceived
      by the observer, rather than a purely visual observation (which 「不安そうだった」 might suggest). It indicates
      a slight detachment and reflection on the perceived state. The phrase 「不安そうに」 itself suggests that
      her unease was evident in her demeanor.
  - english: This task seems to be quite difficult for her.
    japanese:
      - この 仕事 は 彼女 に は かなり 難しい {よう に 思わ れる}。

          - この 仕事 は 彼女 に は かなり 難しい {よう だ}。
        english: This task seems quite difficult for her.
        hint: 「〜ようだ」 is less formal and often based on direct observation rather than a more considered,
          impersonal assessment. We're looking for an impersonal observation about the difficulty.
    scene: Colleagues discussing a new team member's struggles with a complex assignment, making an impersonal
      observation about the difficulty.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: This sentence expresses a subtle, impersonal observation about the difficulty of the task
      as perceived generally, suitable for a professional setting where direct criticism might be avoided.
  - english: He seemed to be a different person after the incident.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は あの 事件 の 後、別人 の {よう に 思わ れ た}。
      - 彼 は あの 事件 の 後、別人 の {よう に 思わ れ まし た}。
    english_literally: He after that incident, different person like seemed.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は あの 事件 の 後、別人 の {よう だっ た}。
        english: He looked like a different person after that incident.
        hint: 「〜ようだった」 describes a direct visual appearance. We're looking for an impression or a general
          perception that he *was* a different person, not just that he looked like one.
    scene: Friends reminiscing about a mutual friend's transformation after a significant life event,
      reflecting on the profound change in his persona.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 「別人 の よう に思われた」 indicates that the change was so profound it led to a general impression
      or understanding among observers that he literally became a different person, going beyond mere
      physical appearance to encompass personality or demeanor.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「思われる」 functions in various contexts. It consistently
  maintains an impersonal and objective tone, whether conveying a general impression (〜ように思われる) or a widely
  accepted belief (〜と思われる). Notice how its formality and indirectness make it suitable for professional,
  academic, or reflective discourse, softening assertions and allowing for a nuanced expression of perception
  or consensus.
