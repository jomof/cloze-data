    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from 「ことになる」, which indicates a decision made by someone other than the speaker. It combines the nominalizer 「こと」 with the 「ている」 form of the verb 「なる」 (to become), to express an ongoing expectation or schedule.",
    "writeup": "「ことになっている」 expresses that something is expected or scheduled to happen. It implies that a rule, custom, or plan is in place, and actions are expected to align with it. The key difference from 「ことになる」 is that 「ことになっている」 emphasizes the expectation or scheduled nature of the event, meaning it is \"becoming that (A),\" but it hasn't necessarily happened yet.\n\nThis grammar point can be used with both the dictionary (plain non-past) and negative forms of verbs. When used with the dictionary form, it indicates that an action is expected to occur. When used with the negative form, it indicates that an action is not expected to occur.",
