    "etymology": "The negative past tense is formed by conjugating the verb's final 「う」 sound to its corresponding 「あ」 sound (or 「わ」 if the original kana was 「う」) and adding 「なかった」 or 「ませんでした」. This construction combines the negative 「ない」 with the past tense 「た」 form.",
    "writeup": "To create the negative past form of う-verbs, you must change the last kana of the verb into its corresponding あ-sound kana (or わ if the original kana was う). Following this, you add the negative auxiliary 「ない」, which then conjugates into its past form, 「なかった」. For the polite form, the verb changes to its い-sound kana, followed by 「ませんでした」.\n\nThis negative past form conveys that something \"did not happen\" or \"was not\".\n\nA semi-polite form can also be used, constructed by adding 「です」 after 「なかった」. While not strictly grammatically standard, this form is widely accepted and common in everyday speech.\n\nNote that 「ある」 is an exception to the regular conjugation rules. Its casual past-negative form is simply 「なかった」, not 「あらなかった」. However, its polite past-negative form, 「ありませんでした」, conjugates as expected for polite negative past tense.",
