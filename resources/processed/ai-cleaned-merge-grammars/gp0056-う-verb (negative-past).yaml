    "etymology": "The negative past tense is derived from the negative auxiliary verb ない, which itself originates from older forms like ぬ or ん. By attaching the past tense auxiliary た (which becomes かった when preceded by い, as ない ends in い), the construction なかった emerged. The polite form ませんでした developed from the negative polite form ません combined with the past auxiliary でした. This structure effectively combines the negation of an action with its completion in the past.",
    "writeup": "The negative past form of Godan verbs (also known as u-verbs) is used to express that an action or state did not occur in the past. There are three primary forms:\n\n*   **Casual (～なかった)**: To form this, change the final kana of the Godan verb to its corresponding あ-sound kana (e.g., 飲む (nomu) becomes 飲ま (noma), 立つ (tatsu) becomes 立た (tata)). If the verb ends in う, it changes to わ (e.g., 買う (kau) becomes 買わ (kawa)). Then, attach なかった. For example, 飲む (nomu) becomes 飲まなかった (nomanakatta - didn't drink).\n\n*   **Semi-polite (～なかった です)**: This form builds upon the casual negative past by simply adding です. For instance, 飲まなかった です (nomanakatta desu). While not strictly grammatically standard in classical Japanese, it is widely used and accepted in modern colloquial Japanese, especially when speaking to someone you respect but with whom you have a somewhat close relationship.\n\n*   **Polite (～ませんでした)**: For the polite form, change the final kana of the Godan verb to its corresponding い-sound kana (e.g., 飲む (nomu) becomes 飲み (nomi), 立つ (tatsu) becomes 立ち (tachi)). Then, attach ませんでした. For example, 飲む (nomu) becomes 飲みませんでした (nomimasendeshita - didn't drink).\n\nAn important exception to note is the verb ある (aru), which means \"to exist\" or \"to be\" for inanimate objects. Its casual past-negative form is simply なかった (nakatta), not あらなかった (aranakatta). However, its polite past-negative form follows the regular pattern: ありませんでした (arimasendeshita).",
