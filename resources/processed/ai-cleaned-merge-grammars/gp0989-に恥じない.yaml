        "nuance": "Carries a strong connotation of upholding honor or maintaining a good reputation.

It differs from simply being 'suitable' by emphasizing the active avoidance of bringing shame or discredit.",
        "colocation": "Commonly colocates with words related to reputation, name, title, such as 名 (na), 期待 (kitai), 信頼 (shinrai), 伝統 (dentō), 称号 (shōgō), 理念 (rinen), 使命 (shimei).",
        "grammatical-role": "Modifies a noun or verb phrase, often acting adverbially to describe the manner in which something is performed or exists."
    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from 「恥じる」 (hajiru), an ichidan verb meaning \"to feel ashamed\" or \"to be ashamed.\" The addition of 「ない」 (nai) negates this, creating the core meaning of \"not being ashamed\" or \"not disgracing.\" The particle 「に」 indicates the object or standard that is not being shamed, resulting in the idiomatic expression \"to live up to\" or \"to be worthy of.\"",
    "writeup": "The phrase 「に恥じない」 (ni hajinai) is a formal expression used to convey that someone or something lives up to a particular standard, reputation, or expectation. It signifies that the subject does not disgrace, dishonor, or fall short of what is expected, but rather maintains or even elevates the reputation associated with a given noun.\n\nThis grammar point emphasizes the act of upholding an existing honor or high standard. It is commonly used in contexts where there is a pre-established reputation, a well-known name, a set of principles, or high expectations that must be met. For example, a sports team might play in a way that 「チームの名に恥じない」 (does not disgrace the team's name), or a product might be of a quality that 「ブランドに恥じない」 (lives up to the brand's name).\n\nStructurally, 「に恥じない」 follows a noun that represents the standard or reputation in question. The particle 「に」 marks this noun as the object toward which the action of 'not shaming' is directed. Because of its core meaning of *not disgracing*, 「に恥じない」 is almost exclusively used in positive contexts, where the subject is being praised or affirmed for their commendable actions or qualities.\n\nWhile primarily a formal expression, its usage can vary depending on the context. In a professional or public setting, it communicates a strong sense of responsibility and dedication to maintaining high standards. In more personal contexts, it might express pride in one's actions or a desire to honor a legacy.",

In contrast, 「にふさわしい」 indicates that something is simply *suitable* or *appropriate* for a given situation or role, without the strong implication of avoiding shame. 「に足る」 is a more formal expression used to state that something *possesses enough merit* to be considered worthy, often for abstract concepts like 'trust' or 'respect', focusing on intrinsic value rather than external reputation management. Choosing the correct expression depends on whether the emphasis is on upholding honor (恥じない), fitting a situation (ふさわしい), or possessing sufficient merit (足る).",
