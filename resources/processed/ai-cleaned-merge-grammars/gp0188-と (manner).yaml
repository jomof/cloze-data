jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  function: Marks sounds, states, or manners of actions, often with mimetic words.
  colocation: Used extensively with onomatopoeia (phonomimes), phenomimes (describing states), and psychomimes
    (describing feelings).
etymology: The particle 「と」 originally indicated co-occurrence or accompaniment. Its use expanded to encompass
  the manner or state of an action, retaining the core sense of association or equivalence between the
  action and its description, particularly evident with mimetic words.
writeup: |-
  The particle 「と」 is used to describe the **manner** or **state** in which an action occurs. It connects actions with sounds, states, or appearances, and is most commonly seen paired with various types of mimetic words.

  Japanese is rich in mimetic words, often categorized into two main types:

  *   **Onomatopoeia (擬音語・ぎおんご):** Words that represent sounds, like animal noises, or the sounds of actions and natural phenomena. For example, 「ざあざあ」 (sound of heavy rain) or 「ぶんぶん」 (buzzing or rapid wagging).
  *   **Phenomimes (擬態語・ぎたいご):** Words that describe states, manners, or appearances, rather than actual sounds. These include words that describe visual states like 「きらきら」 (sparkling) or physical states like 「しっとり」 (damply). A sub-category, **Psychomimes (擬情語・ぎじょうご)**, describes feelings or psychological states, such as 「にこにこ」 (cheerfully smiling) or 「おいおい」 (sobbing bitterly).

  When using 「と」 with mimetic words, an important nuance regarding its usage with repeated versus single mimetic words should be noted. While 「と」 can sometimes be omitted when the mimetic word is repeated (e.g., 「にこにこ 笑う」 is acceptable), it is generally required when the mimetic word is not repeated or is used in a specific, emphatic way (e.g., 「バタンと 閉める」 for a single loud bang). These mimetic expressions are a significant part of the Japanese vocabulary, frequently used by native speakers of all ages and not merely childish utterances; they add vividness and expressiveness to the language.

  - term: ～ように
    meaning: like; as if; in the manner of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「と」, which directly marks the way something is done or said (often with onomatopoeia
      or mimetics), 「～ように」 describes something as being *like* or *as if* it were a certain way, focusing
      on comparison rather than direct description of the manner itself. It also has other uses like 'so
      that' or 'in order to'.
    grammar_point: ように・ような (like・as・similar to)
  - term: と (and)
    meaning: and
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While this grammar point's 「と」 marks the manner of an action, the conjunctive 「と」 is used
      to exhaustively list nouns or connect them with the meaning 'and'.
    grammar_point: と (and, connects nouns)
  - term: と (inevitable consequence)
    meaning: if; when; whenever; expresses a natural consequence or a general truth.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: This 「と」 creates a conditional clause where the result is a direct and inevitable outcome.
      It is distinct from its use as a manner marker, which introduces a way of doing something.
    grammar_point: と (conditional, inevitable result)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion between these expressions, remember that 「と」 is used for
  the *direct manner* of an action, especially when describing sounds, states, or appearance with mimetic
  words. 「～ように」, however, introduces a comparison or similarity, meaning 'like' or 'as if', rather than
  directly describing the manner itself. The other particles and expressions using 'と' (like 'and' or
  'if') have distinct grammatical roles that do not convey the meaning of manner.
