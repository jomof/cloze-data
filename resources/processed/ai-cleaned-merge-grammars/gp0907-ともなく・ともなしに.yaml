    "etymology": "This pattern is a combination of the case-marking particle 「と」, the adverbial particle 「も」, and the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective 「ない」. 「ともなしに」 pairs the noun 「なし」 \"without\" with 「に」, instead of using the conjugative form of 「ない」.",
    "writeup": "「ともなく」 and 「ともなしに」 are structures used to indicate that action A was being done absentmindedly when event B happened. It can be translated as \"unconsciously (A) when (B),\" or \"without paying attention to (A), (B).\" This pattern is a combination of the case-marking particle 「と」, the adverbial particle 「も」, and the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective 「ない」. It will be seen after the dictionary form of verbs, and can be thought of as literally meaning something similar to \"even while not intending to (B), while (A), (B).\" 「ともなしに」 is similar, but pairs the noun 「なし」 \"without\" with 「に」, instead of using the conjugative form of 「ない」.\n\n「ともなく」 and 「ともなしに」 will often be seen in sentences that use 「たら」. This puts emphasis on the specific time that something happened while performing another action absentmindedly. Despite translating this way, the action that precedes 「ともなく」 itself will be intentional, but the thing that comes about as a result of performing that action will not be what the doer was aiming to achieve.",
