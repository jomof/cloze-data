        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "Generally applicable across various contexts.",
        "function": "Indicates an action performed without specific intent or full conscious attention, often leading to an unexpected result.",
        "nuance": "Implies a lack of focus on the action itself, rather than a complete absence of consciousness. The action might be intentional, but the manner or outcome is not. It often carries a subtle sense of inevitability or an unforeseen consequence arising from this unfocused state.",
        "source": "Bunpro",
        "counterpoint": "Distinguishes from simply 'not paying attention' by implying the action was still carried out, albeit without a clear purpose or full awareness.",
        "colocation": "Frequently appears with verbs related to perception, listening, watching, thinking, or movement. Often followed by expressions denoting surprise, sudden realization, or unexpected events (e.g., ～たら、～ているうちに、～ところに).",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions adverbially, modifying the verb it precedes to describe the manner of the action.",
        "logical-flow": "Presents a cause-and-effect relationship where the unfocused action is the 'cause' leading to an unforeseen 'effect' or outcome.",
        "temporal-flow": "Often used to describe a continuous action (e.g., while doing X) that leads to an unexpected event or realization."
    },
    "etymology": "The pattern combines the particle 「と」, the adverbial particle 「も」, and the conjunctive form of the い-adjective 「ない」. 「ともなしに」 pairs the noun 「なし」 'without' with 「に」. It suggests doing something without a specific intention or purpose.",
    "writeup": "The grammar points 「ともなく」 and 「ともなしに」 indicate that action (A) was performed absentmindedly while action (B) occurred. It translates to \"unconsciously (A) when (B)\" or \"without paying attention to (A), (B).\" The structure is a combination of the case-marking particle 「と」, the adverbial particle 「も」, and the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective 「ない」. 「ともなしに」 is similar, but pairs the noun 「なし」 ('without') with 「に」 instead of using the conjugative form of 「ない」.\n\nThis pattern often appears with 「たら」, emphasizing the specific timing of an event happening during another absentminded action. While the initial action is intentional, the resulting outcome is not what was intended. The nuance is similar to 'even while not intending to (B), while (A), (B)'.",
