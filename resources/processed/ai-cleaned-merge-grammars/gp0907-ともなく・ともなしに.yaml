    "etymology": "The pattern combines the particle 「と」, the adverbial particle 「も」, and the conjunctive form of the い-adjective 「ない」. 「ともなしに」 pairs the noun 「なし」 'without' with 「に」. It suggests doing something without a specific intention or purpose.",
    "writeup": "The grammar points 「ともなく」 and 「ともなしに」 indicate that action (A) was performed absentmindedly while action (B) occurred. It translates to \"unconsciously (A) when (B)\" or \"without paying attention to (A), (B).\" The structure is a combination of the case-marking particle 「と」, the adverbial particle 「も」, and the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective 「ない」. 「ともなしに」 is similar, but pairs the noun 「なし」 ('without') with 「に」 instead of using the conjugative form of 「ない」.\n\nThis pattern often appears with 「たら」, emphasizing the specific timing of an event happening during another absentminded action. While the initial action is intentional, the resulting outcome is not what was intended. The nuance is similar to 'even while not intending to (B), while (A), (B)'.",
