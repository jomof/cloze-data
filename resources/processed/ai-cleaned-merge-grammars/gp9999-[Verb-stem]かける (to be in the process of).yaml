  romaji: kakeru
formation:
  Verb-stem + かける: Indicates that an action has begun but is incomplete, or that one is on the verge of
    starting an action.
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: suffix
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to describe an action that is partially completed, on the verge of being completed,
    or started but interrupted. It emphasizes the unfinished state.
  function: Indicates partial completion or an incipient action.
  nuance: Often carries a nuance of incompletion, interruption, or being at a critical point (e.g., about
    to fall). Can suggest fragility or a pending state. It is distinct from simply 'starting' an action;
    it highlights the 'half-done' or 'about-to-do' aspect.
etymology: The verb 「かける」(kakeru) has numerous meanings, including "to hang," "to begin," "to span," or
  "to apply." When used as a suffix 「〜かける」, it draws from the sense of "beginning an action" or "doing
  something partially." The core idea behind its grammatical function is the notion of an action being
  in a state of 'being put on' or 'being initiated' but not yet fully concluded, hence the nuance of incompletion
  or being on the verge of completion. This originates from the concept of 'hanging' something, implying
  it is not fully settled or finished.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「〜かける」 is formed by attaching the verb 「かける」 to the **stem form** of another verb. It conveys the meaning that an action has been started but is not yet complete, or that someone is on the verge of doing something. It emphasizes the **incompleteness** or **incipient nature** of the action.

  For example, 「読みかける」 (yomikakeru) means "to start reading (but not finish)" or "to be in the middle of reading." It implies that the reading was interrupted or only partially done. Similarly, 「食べかける」 (tabekakeru) means "to start eating (but not finish)" or "to eat half of something." The key nuance here is that the action is not fully carried out.

  This form can also express being "about to" do something, especially when there's a sense of suddenness or near miss. For instance, 「倒れかける」 (taorekakeru) means "to be about to fall" or "to almost fall." Here, the action of falling has not fully occurred but is imminent or has just begun.

  「〜かける」 is versatile and can be used with various types of verbs to describe actions that are initiated but left unfinished, or actions that are on the cusp of happening. It is commonly seen in both spoken and written Japanese.

  - term: Verb-stemはじめる (to start doing)
    meaning: to start doing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜はじめる」 emphasizes the definitive beginning of an action, implying a new phase or activity
      has commenced. In contrast, 「〜かける」 suggests that an action has been initiated but is incomplete,
      or that one is on the verge of starting, often with a nuance of interruption or partiality. For
      example, 「本 を 読み始めた」 (Hon o yomihajimeta - I started reading a book) simply states the action began,
      while 「本 を 読みかけた」 (Hon o yomikaketa - I started reading a book but didn't finish/was in the middle
      of reading) implies incompletion.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]はじめる (to start doing)'
  - term: Verb-dictionaryところだ (about to do)
    meaning: to be about to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜ところだ」 indicates that an action is just about to happen, is happening, or has just happened.
      When used to mean "about to do," it emphasizes the *imminence* of the action, suggesting it hasn't
      started yet. 「〜かける」, while sometimes translating to "about to," implies the action has already *begun*
      but is incomplete, or one is at the *verge* of it, hinting at a state of being unfinished.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]ところだ (about to do)'
  - term: Verb-stemおわる (to finish doing)
    meaning: to finish doing
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「〜おわる」 indicates the **completion** of an action, meaning the task is fully done. 「〜かける」,
      on the other hand, describes an action that is **incomplete** or only partially done. They are direct
      opposites in terms of the state of the action.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]おわる (to finish doing)'
  - term: Verb-stemつづける (to continue doing)
    meaning: to continue doing
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「〜続ける」 denotes the **continuation** of an action without interruption. 「〜かける」 implies an action
      that is either **just starting** or has been **interrupted** or is **incomplete**, making them conceptual
      opposites.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]つづける (to continue doing)'
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「〜はじめる」 focuses on the initial point of an action's commencement, 「〜かける」
  emphasizes the state of that action being partial or on the brink of happening. Think of 「〜かける」 as describing
  something that is 'half-done' or 'almost done' rather than just 'started'. When you see 「〜かける」, consider
  the possibility of interruption or incompletion. For 'about to do', 「〜ところだ」 typically describes the
  immediate future, whereas 「〜かける」 might describe a physical state of being on the verge of an action,
  like almost falling.

          for the call to be initiated but unfinished.
    scene: A person explains why they couldn't reach someone.
    register: casual
    setting: casual slang
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「かけかけた」 implies that the action of calling was initiated (e.g., dialing started, or the call
      was on the verge of connecting) but was interrupted before completion due to the phone's battery
      dying. It means the call was 'half-placed'.
  - english: She stared at the picture as if about to speak.
    japanese:

        english: She stared at the picture trying to speak.
        hint: 「話そうとしていた」 indicates an intention or attempt to speak. 「話しけんばかりに」 (from 話しかける) describes
          the outward appearance of being on the *verge* of speaking, not necessarily an active attempt.
          We're looking for the 'as if about to' visual cue.
    scene: An art critic observes someone's intense reaction to a painting.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)

    nuance: 「話しけんばかりに」 uses the archaic volitional form plus 「ばかりに」 to mean 'as if on the verge of speaking'.
      While not a direct conjugation of 「〜かける」, it shows the 'about to' nuance. The core 「話しかけ」 implies
      the initial state of speaking, though in this case, it's figurative.
  - english: The train almost left while I was running to catch it.
    japanese:
      - 走っ て いる うち に、電車 は 出 {かけ} て しまっ た。
      - 走っ て いる うち に、電車 は 出 {かけ} て しまい まし た。
    english_literally: While running, the train started to leave.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 走っ て いる うち に、電車 は 出発 し て しまっ た。
        english: While running, the train departed.
        hint: 「出発してしまった」 implies the train fully departed. 「出かけてしまった」 suggests the train began its movement
          (was 'in the process' of leaving) but not necessarily completed its departure, highlighting
          the 'almost' or narrow escape. We're looking for the sense of the train being 'on the verge
          of leaving'.
    scene: A person recounts their stressful commute.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: 「出かけてしまった」 implies the train began its departure (started to move) while the speaker was still
      attempting to reach it, leading to a sense of near-miss or unfortunate timing. The 「〜てしまう」 adds
      a nuance of regret or completion of the unwanted action.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 「〜かける」 is often used to describe an action that
  is interrupted, left incomplete, or is on the verge of occurring. It's a powerful way to express the
  'half-done' state of a verb. Pay close attention to the context, as it can imply anything from a simple
  unfinished action to a dramatic near-miss.
