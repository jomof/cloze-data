jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to express an action that has started but is not finished, or is about to start,
    or is done only partially.
  function: Expresses incompleteness, imminence, or partiality of an action.
  nuance: Often implies an unfinished state or an action that was interrupted. Can also imply a strong
    intention to start an action.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a suffix to a verb stem, forming a compound verb.
etymology: The verb 「掛ける (かける)」 itself has many meanings, including "to hang," "to start," "to put on,"
  etc. In this grammatical context, it stems from the nuance of "starting something" or "putting something
  in motion," and also "leaving something hanging" or "unfinished." The idea of 「[Verb-stem]かける」 captures
  both the initiation and the potential incompleteness of an action.
writeup: The grammar point 「[Verb-stem]かける」 is attached to the ます-stem of a verb to indicate that an action
  has begun but is not yet complete, or that it is on the verge of beginning. It conveys a sense of incompleteness
  or a partial state of an action. This grammar is versatile and can be used in various contexts to express
  nuance related to the initiation or interruption of an action. For instance, when describing an action
  that suddenly starts, like 「雨が降りかける」 (it starts to rain), or an action that is halfway done, like 「本を読みかける」
  (to be in the middle of reading a book). It can also indicate being on the verge of doing something,
  like 「言いかける」 (to be about to say). The implication of incompleteness is key; the action is not fully
  executed or concluded.

  - term: Verb[dictionary]ところだ
    meaning: about to do, just about to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ところだ」 emphasizes the exact moment an action is about to begin or has just finished. 「かける」
      implies the action has begun or is about to, but focuses more on its incomplete or partial state.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]ところだ (about to do)'
  - term: Verb[stem]はじめる
    meaning: to start doing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「はじめる」 simply means "to start an action." While 「かける」 also indicates a start, it often carries
      an additional nuance of the action being incomplete or interrupted. 「はじめる」 does not inherently carry
      this nuance of incompleteness.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]はじめる (to start doing)'
  - term: Verb[stem]だす
    meaning: to suddenly start doing, to burst into (action)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だす」 emphasizes a sudden, often unexpected, initiation of an action. 「かける」 does not necessarily
      imply suddenness, but rather the onset or partial state.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]だす (to suddenly start doing)'
  - term: Verb[stem]おわる
    meaning: to finish doing
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「おわる」 indicates the completion of an action, which is the opposite of the incompleteness or
      partiality implied by 「かける」.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]おわる (to finish doing)'
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「[Verb-stem]かける」 signifies an action's initiation or partial state,
  it's crucial to distinguish it from similar-sounding expressions. 「[Verb-dictionary]ところだ」 specifically
  points to the imminent beginning or the just-completed action, lacking the continuous or interrupted
  nuance of 「かける」. 「[Verb-stem]はじめる」 is a more general "start," without the strong implication of an unfinished
  state. 「[Verb-stem]だす」 uniquely emphasizes the suddenness of an action's commencement. Conversely, 「[Verb-stem]おわる」
  is the direct opposite, denoting completion. Understanding these subtle differences is key to accurately
  conveying the intended meaning in Japanese.

post_example_writeup: Understanding 「かける」 is about capturing the precise moment of an action's initiation
  or its unfinished state. While it can often be translated as "to start," its unique value lies in implying
  a sense of incompletion or being on the verge of something significant.
