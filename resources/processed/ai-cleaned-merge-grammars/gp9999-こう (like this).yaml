etymology: The demonstrative adverb こう (kou) is part of the こ・そ・あ・ど (ko・so・a・do) series of Japanese demonstratives,
  which indicate proximity to the speaker or listener. Specifically, こう is derived from こ (ko), meaning
  'this,' combined with an old particle signifying 'manner' or 'state.' This structure is mirrored in
  そう (sou), ああ (aa), and どう (dou), each referring to a manner or state relative to different points of
  reference. Its origin clearly links it to the immediate context of the speaker or the method being currently
  presented.
writeup: |-
  こう (kou) is an adverbial demonstrative that translates to “like this” or “in this way.” It is used to refer to a manner or state that is either directly demonstrated by the speaker, about to be explained by the speaker, or implicitly understood from the immediate context or shared experience.

  Think of こう as referring to the 'manner' or 'way' that is physically close to the speaker, or that the speaker is introducing to the conversation. It emphasizes the immediacy of the action or state as perceived or presented by the speaker.

  While こう is most commonly used to modify verbs, describing how an action is performed, it can also modify adjectives to express a state or degree that is currently apparent. For instance, こう 暑い (kou atsui) would mean “this hot” or “so hot like this,” emphasizing the current oppressive heat the speaker is experiencing.

  - term: そう (like that)
    meaning: Like that; in that way
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: そう refers to a manner or state that is close to the listener, or something that has already
      been mentioned or is mutually understood by both speaker and listener. Unlike こう, it does not refer
      to something the speaker is currently demonstrating or about to explain.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:こう・そう・ああ・どう (like this・that・that over there・how)
  - term: ああ (like that)
    meaning: Like that (over there); in that way (distant or remembered)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ああ refers to a manner or state that is physically distant from both the speaker and the listener,
      or something that is recalled from memory or a shared past experience. It implies a sense of realization
      or nostalgia when used in reference to past events. It is not about the immediate, present demonstration
      like こう.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:こう・そう・ああ・どう (like this・that・that over there・how)
  - term: どう (how)
    meaning: How; in what way
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: どう is an interrogative adverb asking about the manner or state. It is used to inquire about
      a method or condition, whereas こう, そう, and ああ are answers or statements about a known method or
      condition.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:こう・そう・ああ・どう (like this・that・that over there・how)
post_false_friends_writeup: The set of adverbs こう, そう, ああ, and どう are fundamental for expressing manners
  and states in Japanese, with each indicating a different proximity or interrogative function. Think
  of them as the adverbial counterparts to the demonstrative pronouns これ (this), それ (that), あれ (that over
  there), and どれ (which). Just as これ points to a thing near the speaker, こう refers to a manner or state
  near the speaker or what the speaker is currently demonstrating. Similarly, そう relates to something
  near the listener or previously discussed, and ああ points to something distant or recalled. どう is always
  the question, asking 'how?' Understanding this proximity system is key to correctly distinguishing their
  usage.

        hint: 「そんなに」 emphasizes degree or extent in relation to what has been perceived or mentioned.
          While similar, 「こう」 more directly points to the current, immediate sensation of heat the speaker
          is experiencing and wants to share.

          defining or reflecting on, making it feel more personal and immediate.
    scene: Two long-time friends, after sharing stories, muse about the unpredictable nature of existence.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The phrase 「人生 って」 (jinsei tte) is a casual way to introduce the topic of 'life.' The phrase
      「こう いう もの だ よ ね」 (kou iu mono da yo ne) implies 'it's this kind of thing,' referring to the specific
      experiences or observations being discussed, and seeks agreement with 「よ ね」 (yo ne), making the

        english: When you try it with that method, it's unexpectedly difficult, isn't it?
        hint: 「そのやり方」 (sono yarikata) specifically means 'that method' or 'that way of doing.' While correct,
          「こう」 offers a more immediate, less explicit reference to the current experimental approach.
    scene: Two colleagues are attempting a new, seemingly simple, task together and find it more challenging
