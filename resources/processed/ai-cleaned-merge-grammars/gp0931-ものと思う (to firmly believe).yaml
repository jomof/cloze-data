jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Stiff/Rigid; mainly used in written language or formal speeches.
  grammatical-role: Acts as a predicate that indicates the speaker's strong conviction or expectation
    regarding a fact or situation.
  logical-flow: Presents the speaker's perspective as a firm, almost undeniable truth, leading to an implication
    of certainty or a basis for action.
  temporal-flow: Applicable to present, past, and future beliefs or expectations, with the strength of
    conviction applying across time.
etymology: 「物 (mono)」 means 'thing' or 'matter.' In this context, it adds a sense of concreteness or certainty
  to the thought. 「と」 is a particle indicating the content of thought or speech. 「思う (omou)」 means 'to
  think.' Together, they create a sense of thinking of something as a concrete fact. The nuance of 「もの」
  here is akin to a 'definite thing' or 'established fact,' which strengthens the verb 'to think' into
  'to believe firmly' or 'to take for granted.'
writeup: The grammar point 「ものと思う」 is used to express a strong conviction or expectation. It is formed
  by connecting the attributive form of a verb, adjective, or noun (including 「だ」, 「です」, or 「である」) with
  「ものと思う」. The literal meaning is 'to think of something as a concrete matter.' This phrase elevates a
  mere opinion or thought to a belief that is treated as a solid, undeniable fact, at least from the speaker's
  perspective. It conveys a strong sense of certainty, often implying that the speaker has good reason
  for their conviction, or that the belief is deeply ingrained. While it can be used in spoken Japanese,
  especially in formal contexts like speeches or declarations, it is more commonly found in written language
  due to its somewhat rigid and assertive nuance.
false_friends:
  - term: 〜と思う
    meaning: I think that...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜と思う」expresses a general thought or opinion, while 「ものと思う」conveys a stronger sense of conviction
      or expectation, treating the thought as a more concrete reality.
    grammar_point: と思う (I think or thought)
  - term: 〜と考える
    meaning: to consider that...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「ものと思う」, 「〜と考える」 suggests deliberation or a logical conclusion rather than a strong,
      conviction-like belief that something is a concrete fact.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:と考える (to consider, to think deliberately)
  - term: 〜と確信する
    meaning: to be certain that...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜と確信する」 expresses absolute certainty or conviction, whereas 「ものと思う」 implies a very strong
      belief or expectation that something is true, but may allow for a slight degree of uncertainty or
      acknowledge that it's the speaker's strong perspective.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:と確信する (to be certain, to be convinced)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「ものと思う」, 「〜と思う」, 「〜と考える」, and 「〜と確信する」 all relate to expressing thoughts
  or beliefs, they differ significantly in the level of conviction and nuance. 「ものと思う」 asserts a strong,
  almost factual belief, treating the thought as a concrete reality. 「〜と思う」 is a general expression of
  opinion, less forceful. 「〜と考える」 implies more deliberation or a logical process of thought. 「〜と確信する」,
  on the other hand, conveys an absolute certainty, leaving no room for doubt. Choosing the correct expression
  depends on the precise degree of certainty and the nature of the belief one wishes to convey.

      phrasing highlights a deep-seated conviction that the individual considers a concrete fact. The
      casual register and male speaker imply this is a reflective statement about someone's internal state.
      There isn't specific Japanese in this sentence that is gender-exclusive, but the overall tone fits
      a general observation about a male individual, perhaps spoken by a male.

    conjugation: volitional (～よう)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The slightly self-directed, determined nuance of 'I will endeavor to believe/think of it as
      a given' is captured by 「ものと思おう」. It implies a personal commitment to establish a belief as a truth
      for oneself, treating it as an established reality. The use of the volitional form 「思おう」 here suggests
      a strong personal resolve. While not explicitly gendered Japanese, the reflective and self-improvement
      context can be used by anyone. The speaker being female here does not introduce any specific gendered
      language, but rather reflects a common introspective sentiment.

    setting: informative
    conjugation: passive (～られる/～かれる)
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「ものと思う」 is used to express convictions or firm beliefs
  across various contexts and tenses. Notice how its usage elevates the statement from a simple thought
  to a concept treated as a concrete reality, whether it's a personal conviction, an assumption that leads
  to action, or a widely held belief. The nuances of formality, speaker's intent, and the firmness of
  the belief are key in choosing this grammar point over simpler expressions of thought.
