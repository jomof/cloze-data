    "etymology": "The conjunctive particle 「なり」 stems from the classical auxiliary verb 「なり」, which itself originated from the combination of the particle 「に」 (ni, indicating location or state) and the verb 「あり」 (ari, to be/exist). This auxiliary verb would attach to the attributive form of verbs or adjectives to signify a state or condition. In its conjunctive use, it evolved to express an immediate transition or consequence, highlighting the instantaneous nature of the progression. It literally means something like \"being in the state of [first action], then [second action].\"",
    "writeup": "The particle 「なり」 expresses that something happens immediately after something else, conveying the meaning of \"as soon as (A), then (B)\" or \"the moment (A) happens, then (B)\". It connects two events that occur in very quick succession, highlighting the instantaneous nature of the cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nThis grammar point is typically used with verbs in their dictionary form (辞書形). The second part of the sentence (B) often describes something surprising, unexpected, or a strong reaction driven by emotion or will. While it can describe various types of actions, it is almost exclusively used to describe the actions of others, rather than the speaker themselves.\n\nWhile 「なり」 can be perceived as slightly old-fashioned or formal, it adds a certain literary flair and dramatic emphasis to the immediacy of events. It is most commonly found in written contexts or more formal spoken Japanese.",
