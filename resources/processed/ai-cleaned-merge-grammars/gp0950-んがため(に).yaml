        "function": "Indicates the explicit purpose or intent behind an action.",
        "nuance": "Carries a strong sense of purpose and determination. The 'ん' is a remnant of the classical volitional/conjectural auxiliary 'む', implying a firm intention on the part of the subject. It is often used for significant or profound goals.",
        "source": "Classical Japanese grammar",
        "colocation": "Often followed by に or の. If followed by a noun, の is used (e.g., Vんがための noun). If followed by a verb or clause, に is used (e.g., Vんがために V)."
    },
    "etymology": "「んがため」 stems from 「むがため」. The 「む」 is a classical auxiliary verb signifying intent or strong will, similar to modern 「う」 or 「よう」. Over time, 「む」 often phonetically shifted to 「ん」 in certain contexts. 「が」 is a possessive particle, and 「ため」 means 'sake' or 'purpose'. Thus, the phrase literally means 'for the sake of [one's] intention' or 'for the purpose of [one's] will', conveying a resolute pursuit of a goal. This structure evokes a sense of formal, sometimes literary, dedication to an objective.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「んがため(に)」 is employed to articulate that an action is performed \"for the explicit purpose of\" or \"with a specific goal in mind.\" It is a highly formal and somewhat archaic expression, predominantly encountered in written literature, official documents, or dignified speeches rather than daily conversation. The core of this pattern lies in 「ん」, which is derived from the classical auxiliary verb 「む」. This 「む」 signifies intent, strong will, or conjecture, akin to the modern Japanese volitional endings 「う」 and 「よう」. When used in 「んがため(に)」, it is attached to the 未然形 (irrealis or imperfective stem) of the preceding verb.\n\nThis structure strongly implies the speaker's (or subject's) resolute will to achieve the stated goal. Consequently, the verb preceding 「んがため(に)」 must describe an action that is controllable by the subject. It cannot be used for involuntary actions or states of being.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   **Formality and Usage**: This pattern lends a weighty and determined tone to the statement. Its use is limited to formal contexts, making it unsuitable for casual interactions. Its formality often elevates the significance of the goal being described.\n*   **Connection to する**: For verbs ending in 「する」, the older 未然形 「せ」 is used instead of the more common modern 「し」. Thus, you will see 「せんがため」 (e.g., 成功させんがため) rather than 「しんがため」.\n*   **Particle Usage**: The particle 「に」 is commonly used after 「んがため」 when it modifies a verb or a clause, indicating the purpose of an action. For example, 「目的を達成せんがために努力する」 (to strive in order to achieve the goal). When it modifies a noun, 「の」 is used, creating a phrase like 「目的を達成せんがための努力」 (effort for the purpose of achieving the goal).",
