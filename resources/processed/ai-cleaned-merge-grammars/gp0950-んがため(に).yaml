    "etymology": "「んがため」 comes from 「むがため」. 「む」 is a classical auxiliary verb indicating intent, similar to 「う」 or 「よう」. 「が」 is a particle, and 「ため」 means 'sake' or 'purpose'. Together, they express a strong will or intention to achieve a goal.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「んがため」 is used to express that something is done \"for the purpose of\" or \"with [something] as the goal\". It carries a formal and somewhat archaic tone. 「ん」 comes from an abbreviation of 「む」, a classical auxiliary verb used to show intent, similar to 「う」 and 「よう」 in modern Japanese. It is followed by 「が」, and then the noun 「ため」, which means \"sake\" or \"purpose\". 「ん」 connects to the 未然形 (ない form stem) of verbs.\n\n「んがため」 implies the speaker's strong will to achieve a goal. The verb that 「ん」 is attached to must be something that can be controlled by the speaker.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   Like most classical structures that interact with 「する」, the older form 「せ」 is used as the base, rather than 「し」.  For example, 「せんがため」 instead of 「しんがため」.\n*   This grammar point is considered formal and somewhat literary. You'll encounter it more often in written materials than in everyday conversation.",
