    "etymology": "「んがため」comes from an abbreviation of 「む」, a classical auxiliary verb indicating intent, followed by 「が」, and the noun 「ため」 meaning \"sake\" or \"purpose\".",
    "writeup": "「んがため(に)」 is a formal grammar pattern used to express that something is done \"for the purpose of\" A, or \"with A as the goal\". 「ん」 comes from an abbreviation of 「む」, a classical auxiliary verb indicating intent or strong will, similarly to 「う」and 「よう」 in modern Japanese. It is then followed by 「が」, and the noun 「ため」 meaning \"sake\" or \"purpose\". 「ん」 connects to the indeterminate form (ない-stem) of verbs.\n\nEither 「の」 or 「に」 usually follows 「んがため」, depending on whether it is followed directly by a noun or a statement linking to a verb.\n\nThe meaning of 「む」 is retained in 「ん」, so this grammar structure implies the speaker's will to achieve the goal of A. As 「む」 expresses intent, the verb that 「ん」 attaches to must be controllable by the speaker.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n*   **Formality:** This grammar point is highly formal and often found in written or very formal speech.\n    *   **「する」Exception:** Like most classical structures that interact with 「する」, the more old-fashioned 「せん」 is used as the base, rather than 「し」.",
