    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「も」 adds emphasis to the quantity, highlighting that even that much is enough. The conditional 「ば」 form sets up the condition under which the sufficiency applies.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「も~ば」 indicates that a certain amount of something is sufficient to achieve a particular outcome. It combines 「も」, which emphasizes the quantity, with the conditional 「ば」 form of a verb to express that \"if there is as much as X, then Y will be sufficient/possible.\"\n\n*   It is often used with numbers and counters to specify a quantity. For example, 「３日もあれば」 means \"if there are as many as 3 days.\"\n*   The level of formality can vary based on the verb and overall sentence structure.",
