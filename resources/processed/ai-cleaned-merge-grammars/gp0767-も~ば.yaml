    "writeup": "The grammar point 「も~ば」 indicates that a certain amount of something is sufficient to achieve a particular outcome. It combines 「も」, which emphasizes the quantity, with the conditional 「ば」 form of a verb to express that \"if there is as much as X, then Y will be sufficient/possible.\"\n\nIt is often used with numbers and counters to specify a quantity. For example, 「３日もあれば」 means \"if there are as many as 3 days.\"\n\nThe level of formality can vary based on the verb and overall sentence structure. It is a versatile expression for conveying adequacy.",

While both convey sufficiency, 「さえ～ば」 focuses on the *minimum required condition*, often implying nothing else is needed. 「も~ば」 highlights the *extent* of what is available and that it is enough."

On the other hand, 「さえ~ば」 means \"if only there is this much, it's sufficient,\" placing an exclusive emphasis on the minimum necessary condition. For example, 「1000円もあれば」 implies a positive nuance of \"1000 yen is enough,\" whereas 「1000円さえあれば」 emphasizes that \"if only I have 1000 yen, I don't need anything else,\" stressing the singularity of that condition.",
