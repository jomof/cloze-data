jlpt: N5
etymology: 'The Japanese demonstrative system, known as the ''Ko-So-A-Do'' series, is deeply rooted in
  spatial deixis. 「あれ」, belonging to the ''A'' series, indicates a referent that is distant from both
  the speaker (ko-series: here/this) and the listener (so-series: there/that). Historically, this system
  developed to clearly distinguish proximity to the speaker, proximity to the listener, and distance from
  both. The ''A'' series (あれ, あの, あそこ, あちら, etc.) consistently points to something spatially or psychologically
  removed from the immediate interaction of the speaker and listener. This consistent spatial logic underpins
  its usage for both tangible objects far away and abstract concepts that are ''distant'' or ''out of
  reach'' in a conversational context.'
writeup: 「あれ」 is a demonstrative pronoun that points to something or someone that is far away from both
  the speaker and the listener. It is part of the fundamental こ・そ・あ・ど (ko-so-a-do) series of demonstratives,
  where 「こ-」 (kore, kono, koko) indicates proximity to the speaker, 「そ-」 (sore, sono, soko) indicates
  proximity to the listener, and 「あ-」 (are, ano, asoko) indicates distance from both. 「ど-」 (dore, dono,
  doko) is used for questions. This word is versatile and can refer to physical objects, people, or even
  abstract concepts or events that are not immediately present in the conversation. When referring to
  a tangible item, imagine pointing to something across a large room or across the street. In informal
  conversation, 「あれ」 can also be used as a filler word when someone is trying to recall a word or phrase,
  much like "that thingy" or "you know" in English. It can also be used to refer to a topic or person
  that is generally known to both parties but is not being explicitly named, often with a conspiratorial
  or intimate nuance. For example, if two friends are talking about a mutual acquaintance without saying
  their name directly, they might use 「あれ」.

    meaning: this (near speaker)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「これ」 refers to something physically close to the speaker. 「あれ」 refers to something physically
      distant from both.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:これ・それ・あれ・どれ (demonstrative pronouns)
  - term: それ

    nuance: 「それ」 refers to something physically close to the listener. 「あれ」 refers to something physically
      distant from both.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:これ・それ・あれ・どれ (demonstrative pronouns)
  - term: どれ
    meaning: which one
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どれ」 is an interrogative pronoun asking "which one?" among several options. 「あれ」 is a declarative
      pronoun pointing to a specific distant item.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:これ・それ・あれ・どれ (demonstrative pronouns)
  - term: あの
    meaning: that (far from both, modifies noun)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「あの」 is an adjectival demonstrative that modifies a noun (e.g., あの人 - "that person"). 「あれ」
      is a pronoun that stands alone (e.g., あれは本です - "That is a book."). They both refer to distant objects.
    grammar_point: この (this)
  - term: あそこ
    meaning: over there (far from both, location)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「あそこ」 refers specifically to a distant location ("over there"). 「あれ」 refers to a distant object,
      person, or concept.
    grammar_point: ここ (here)
  - term: あちら
    meaning: that way (polite direction/person)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「あちら」 is the polite form of 「あそこ」, referring to a distant direction or a polite way to refer
      to a person/group. 「あれ」 refers to a distant object or concept.
    grammar_point: あちら (that way over there, formal)
post_false_friends_writeup: When using the Ko-So-A-Do series, remember that 「あれ」 refers to items or concepts
  distant from both the speaker and the listener. Distinguish it from 「これ」 (near speaker) and 「それ」 (near
  listener). Crucially, 「あれ」 is a pronoun and stands alone, unlike 「あの」 which modifies a noun (e.g., 「あの本」
  - that book). Similarly, 「あそこ」 refers to a distant place, while 「あれ」 refers to a distant thing or idea.
  Understanding the subtle spatial and functional distinctions will help you choose the correct demonstrative.

        english: That from last week, what was it called again?

          - 誰 だ っけ、赤い 帽子 の 人...
        english: Who was it, the person with the red hat...

      the person's name or exact details.

      - competing_japanese:
          - ああ、違い ます。
        english: Oh, that's wrong.

          - そう いえ ば、例 の 件 は どう なっ た？
        english: Speaking of which, what happened with that particular matter?

      using a vague reference.
    register: semi-formal

      understood, allowing for a more concise (though vague) reference in a professional setting.

        english: That is probably the most difficult thing.
        hint: 「それ」 would be used if the difficult thing was recently discussed or is closer in conversational
          proximity. We're looking for 「あれ」 to imply a more distant or abstract concept.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 問題 が 多分 一番 難しい こと だ。
        english: This problem is probably the most difficult thing.
        hint: Using a specific noun like 問題 (problem) makes the reference clear. We're looking for the

      explicitly naming it.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: 「あれ」 is used to refer to a complex, abstract concept or situation that is understood by both
      parties, indicating it as the main point of difficulty. The formal 「だ」 fits the academic discussion.

          - これ は あなた の です か？

          - 見 て、あの 雲、すごい！
        english: Look, that cloud is amazing!
        hint: Using 「あの」 + noun (雲 - cloud) is more specific. We're looking for the use of 「あれ」 as a general
          demonstrative for a distant object.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 見 て、あそこ、すごい！
        english: Look, over there, it's amazing!
        hint: 「あそこ」 refers to a place. We're looking for 「あれ」 referring to a specific thing (like a cloud
          formation) within that distant area.
    scene: Two friends are watching a cloud formation from a distance, and one points out an impressive
      sight.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: Used in an exclamatory way to point out something remarkable that is far away. The truncated,
      casual speech ("すごい" instead of "すごいです") emphasizes the immediate reaction.

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 何？また 変 な 音 が する。
        english: What? A strange sound again.
        hint: Using 「何」 (what) is a direct question. We're looking for 「あれ」 as an exclamation of realization
          or slight confusion.
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 音 は 何？
        english: What is that sound?
        hint: 「その音」 is used if the sound is closer or more directly related to the listener. We're looking
          for a sound that is distant or ambiguous enough to warrant 「あれ」.
    scene: You are at home and hear a recurring, strange noise coming from a distant part of the house,
      prompting a moment of realization.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「あれ」 is used here as an interjection expressing mild surprise or realization, often followed
      by a thought or observation. It refers to something intangible (the sound) that is 'there' but not
      immediately identifiable.
  - english: That's a secret.
    japanese:
      - '{あれ} は 秘密 です。'

    english_literally: That (thing) is a secret.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - それ は 秘密 です。
        english: That is a secret.
        hint: 「それ」 implies the secret was just mentioned or is closer in context. We're looking for 「あれ」
          to maintain a slight distance or vagueness about the topic.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 に は 言え ませ ん。
        english: I cannot tell you.
        hint: This phrase directly states inability to disclose. We're looking for a response that labels
          the information itself as a secret using 「あれ」.
    scene: Someone asks about a sensitive topic, and you respond by saying it's a secret, implicitly referring
      to the topic with "are."
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「あれ」 subtly refers to the undisclosed information, maintaining politeness in a slightly evasive
      response.
