jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: suffix
  register: casual
  usage-context: general
  nuance: げ is more subjective (based on the speaker's opinion) than そう, and is considered to be very
    low confidence. It indicates that the speaker is sensing something rather than making a direct observation.
etymology: The suffix 「げ」 originates from the kanji 「気」 (ki), which means "spirit," "mind," or "feeling."
  The suffix 「げ」 retains a sense of sensing or feeling something, but in a more subtle or indirect way.
  Instead of directly stating a feeling, it indicates that something *gives off the feeling* of something.
writeup: The suffix 「げ」, sometimes written as 「気」, expresses that something "gives off the feeling of
  (A)" or "seems like (A)." It's frequently used with emotions and feelings, where certainty is difficult.
  It can follow the stem form of い-adjectives, the stem of な-adjectives, or nouns, creating a new な-adjective
  meaning "(A) seeming." This can be followed by 「な」 or 「に」 depending on whether it modifies a noun or
  verb. 「げ」 is more subjective than 「そう」, indicating lower confidence, because the speaker is "sensing"
  something. Because it expresses something that the speaker is sensing, it can be difficult to explain
  to others how to use it.

  - term: そうに・そうな
    meaning: Seem, look like, sound
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「げ」, 「そうに／そうな」 is often used with more direct sensory information. It expresses a judgment
      based on what one sees or hears, not just a feeling.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem・Adj-stem]〜そうだ (it seems・looks like)'
  - term: ような気がする
    meaning: Have a feeling that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「げ」, 「ような気がする」 is a more direct expression of one's own feeling or intuition, rather
      than an observation of an apparent emotion in someone else.
    grammar_point: ような気がする (have a feeling)
  - term: み
    meaning: ~ness, used to indicate conditions or nature
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「げ」, 「み」 is used to describe a quality or characteristic, not to suggest that something
      appears a certain way. It's about inherent nature, not perceived appearance.
    grammar_point: み (suffix inherent quality)
  - term: ぎみ
    meaning: Looking, feeling a little, touch of, tending to, slightly
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「げ」, 「ぎみ」 is used to express that something is leaning toward a certain condition or
      state, but not necessarily expressing an emotion or feeling in the same way.
    grammar_point: ぎみ (slight tendency or feeling)
  - term: っぽい
    meaning: ish; characteristic of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「げ」, 「っぽい」 implies something has a tendency or characteristic quality. 「げ」 focuses
      more on the apparent feeling or emotion.
    grammar_point: っぽい (ish; characteristic of)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「げ」 is best used to describe how someone
  *appears* to be feeling, rather than stating how you *know* they feel. Choose 「げ」 when you're inferring
  someone's emotional state based on their behavior or expression. 「そう」 is more direct, based on sensory
  input. The others are qualities of something.
