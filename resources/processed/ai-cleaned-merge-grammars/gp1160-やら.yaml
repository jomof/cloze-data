        "usage-context": "Used to express uncertainty or doubt about something, often a question directed towards oneself. It can be used with verbs, adjectives, and nouns in their plain form. When used with な-adjectives or nouns, だ is typically omitted in casual speech, especially in the 'やら' and 'ことやら' forms.",
        "function": "To indicate a feeling of not knowing or being unsure about something.",

    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「やら」 is thought to have evolved from a combination of the interrogative particle 「や」 and the conjunctive or expressive particle 「ら」. The original 「や」 was used to pose questions, and the addition of 「ら」 likely contributed to the nuance of listing possibilities or expressing indefiniteness, leading to its current use for self-addressed wonder or uncertainty. Its interrogative root connects it to other question-forming particles.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「やら」 is used at the end of a sentence to express a question or doubt to oneself, conveying a sense of \"I wonder...\" or uncertainty. It is predominantly used in informal speech, often when the speaker is internally pondering a situation or outcome, not seeking an answer from others.\n\nThere are generally three main patterns for using 「やら」, each with slight nuances:\n\n*   **~のやら**: This is the most common form, directly translating to \"I wonder if...\" or \"I wonder what/where/when...\". It attaches to the plain form of verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives (using な/である/だった/であった), and nouns (using な/である/だった/であった). It expresses a general sense of not knowing or being unsure.\n\n*   **~ことやら**: This form also means \"I wonder if...\" but carries a stronger nuance of concern, worry, or even hopelessness about the situation. It often implies a negative outlook or a feeling of helplessness regarding an uncertain future. It attaches to the plain form of verbs and い-adjectives, and to な-adjectives and nouns using 形式名詞 (formal nouns) like である/だった/であった, with だ being omitted.\n\n*   **~やら**: This form is used more broadly to express uncertainty or a lack of clear distinction between multiple possibilities, often translated as \"whether...or...\" or \"who knows...\". It attaches to the plain form of verbs and い-adjectives. For な-adjectives and nouns, the だ is typically omitted, attaching directly to the stem or past form. It can be used when listing alternatives or expressing a general state of not fully comprehending something.\n\nWhile 「やら」 indicates an internal monologue, it is still frequently spoken aloud in casual settings, reflecting the speaker's thoughts to their immediate audience.",
