    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ほうが~より」 is used to make comparisons. It indicates that one thing is more (adjective) than another, or one action is done more (adverb) than another. There are no explicit comparative forms of adjectives or adverbs in Japanese; this structure fulfills that role. The 「より」 part can be omitted if the context makes the comparison clear. \n\nFor example, you can compare people, objects, or actions. It can be used in a variety of situations, from casual conversation to more formal discussions.",
