    "writeup": "A rhetorical question in Japanese, as in other languages, is a question posed not to elicit an answer, but to make a statement or express an opinion forcefully. It's a versatile tool used to convey a range of emotions, from surprise and disbelief to indignation and sarcasm.\n\n**Key characteristics:**\n\n*   **No expected answer:** The speaker isn't genuinely seeking information.\n*   **Emphasis:** Rhetorical questions emphasize a point or opinion.\n*   **Emotional impact:** They can convey strong emotions.\n*   **Context-dependent:** The interpretation heavily relies on context and tone.\n\n**Common patterns:**\n\n*   Using question words like 「どうして」 (why), 「誰が」 (who), 「何が」 (what) to express disbelief or challenge an idea.\n*   Adding question markers like 「か」, 「の」, 「だろうか」 to statements to turn them into rhetorical questions.\n*   Using negative questions to imply a positive statement (e.g., 「～ないだろうか」 – wouldn’t it be…?).\n\nUnderstanding rhetorical questions is essential for grasping the nuances of Japanese communication, as they can significantly alter the meaning and impact of a statement.",
