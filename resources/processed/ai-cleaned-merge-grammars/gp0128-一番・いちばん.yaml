        "usage-context": "When comparing items, the scope within which the comparison is being made should be specified (e.g., “in my family,” “among these books”).",

    "etymology": "一番 literally translates to “number one”. It evolved from simply denoting the first item in a sequence to signifying the highest degree or best quality of something.",
    "writeup": "**一番 (ichiban)** means “most”, “best”, or “number one.” It is used to express the superlative degree, indicating that something surpasses all others in a particular quality or aspect. It can be placed before an adjective to modify it (e.g., 一番大きい - the biggest) or used adverbially to modify a verb (e.g., 一番早く走る - run the fastest). When comparing items, specifying the scope of the comparison is important. For example, 「家族 の 中 で 一番」 means “the most in my family.” However, 一番 cannot be directly affixed to a noun (e.g., *一番先生 is incorrect for “the best teacher”). Instead, it must precede an adjective, such as 「一番 いい 先生」. In cases where the meaning is clear, especially with adverbs like よく (“well,” “frequently”), the adverbial form may be omitted. This grammatical point is commonly used across all registers, though the surrounding sentence structure may vary.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "Remember, 「一番」 is about degree or ranking, meaning ‘the most’ or ‘number one’ in terms of quality, quantity, or intensity. In contrast, 「最初に」 is about sequence, meaning ‘first’ in terms of time or order. Do not confuse the two; one expresses supremacy, the other expresses priority.",
