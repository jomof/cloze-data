    "etymology": "The grammar point 「たりとも」 is derived from the auxiliary verb 「たり」, which indicates examples, and the conjunction particle 「とも」, which expresses approximate limitations. Therefore, the literal meaning is close to \"even limited to (A) as an example, not (B)\", with the \"not (B)\" part coming from the negative structure in the sentence.",
    "writeup": "「たりとも」 is a grammar pattern primarily used in negative sentences to emphasize that something is not an exception. It typically follows number words or nouns. It conveys the meaning of \"not even one (A)\" or \"not a single (A).\" The structure is quite formal and not commonly used in everyday conversation.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   A common expression using this pattern is 「何人たりとも」 (nannin taritomo), meaning \"no matter who it is, without exception.\"",

            "etymology": "「ユンボ」 (yunbo) is a loanword from the French word \"jumbo\" and refers to a backhoe.",
            "nuance": "「押し入れようとしたが」 emphasizes their combined effort, and 「動かなかったから」 highlights the futility, leading to the final solution 「ユンボで押し込みました」, a casual retelling of an event.",
