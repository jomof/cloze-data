    },
    "etymology": "たりとも comes from the combination of 「たり」 (from the verb 「足る」, meaning 'to be sufficient') and the particle 「とも」 (meaning 'together with', 'also', 'even'). The 「たり」 here indicates a minimum quantity or example, and 「とも」 emphasizes that even this minimum is not met in the negative context.",
    "writeup": "たりとも is a grammar pattern primarily used in negative sentences to emphasize that something is **not** an exception. It typically follows number words or nouns, conveying the sense of \"not even one\" or \"not a single.\" For example, 「一円たりとも」 means \"not even one yen.\"\n\nStrictly speaking, 「たりとも」 is a combination of the auxiliary verb 「たり」 ('presenting examples') and the conjunction particle 「とも」 ('presenting approximate limitations'). A more literal translation might be \"even limited to (A) as an example, not (B),\" where \"not (B)\" comes from the negative structure in the second half of the sentence.\n\nThis expression is quite formal and not commonly used in everyday conversation. However, the set phrase 「何人たりとも」 ('no matter who it is, no exceptions') is relatively more frequent.",
