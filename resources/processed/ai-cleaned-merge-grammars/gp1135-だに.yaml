        "Verb (dictionary form) + だに": "Expresses a feeling or thought triggered by merely performing the verb. This often implies a strong emotion, such as fear, disgust, or embarrassment, but can also convey envy or admiration.",

        "function": "Emphasizes that a minimal action or thought is sufficient to evoke a strong feeling, or highlights a complete lack of action or consideration.",
        "nuance": "「だに」 imparts a strong, often literary, tone. When used with verbs, it intensifies the emotional impact of the act of merely doing or thinking something. When paired with 「～しない」, it underscores an absolute absence of action, often implying negligence or extreme indifference. It is far more formal and less common in daily conversation than similar expressions.",
        "source": "resources/original/dojg/all/だに.yaml",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a correlative particle, linking the preceding minimal action or thought to a subsequent emotional or behavioral outcome."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「だに」 is believed to have originated from classical Japanese. While its exact etymology is debated, one theory suggests it evolved from a combination of 「だ」 (a form of the copula) and 「に」 (a particle indicating location or direction). Over time, it developed its unique function of emphasizing an extreme condition or the minimal threshold for something to occur. Its usage is rooted in older literary forms and retains a formal, sometimes archaic, flavor.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「だに」 is a sophisticated grammatical element primarily found in formal writing and elevated speech. It serves two main functions: either to express that merely thinking about or performing an action is enough to trigger a profound emotional response, or to emphasize a complete absence of an action, even a very minor one.When combined with a verb in its dictionary form (e.g., 「思うだに」, 「考えるだに」), 「だに」 signifies that 'just' or 'merely' engaging in that action is sufficient to produce a strong feeling. This feeling is often negative, such as fear (恐ろしい), embarrassment (恥ずかしい), or disgust (嫌悪感), but it can also convey strong envy (羨ましい) or admiration. It highlights the intensity of the emotion relative to the simplicity of the trigger.Conversely, when 「だに」 is used in the negative form 「～だにしない」, it emphasizes that the subject 'doesn't even' perform a certain action. This construction implies an absolute lack of action or consideration, often suggesting indifference, neglect, or an unexpected omission. For example, 「注意だにしない」 means 'doesn't even pay attention' or 'doesn't even warn'. This usage stresses the extreme degree of inaction. Because of its formal and somewhat archaic nature, 「だに」 is generally not used in casual conversation.",

            "term": "だけでも",
            "meaning": "just by doing/thinking X; even if only X",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「だけでも」 is more common and less formal than 「だに」. While both can express 'just by doing X', 「だに」 often implies a more profound or overwhelming emotional response, or a more absolute lack of action in negative constructions. 「だけでも」 simply states a minimal condition or result without the strong emotional or literary overtone."

            "term": "さえ",
            "meaning": "even; moreover",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「さえ」 also means 'even', but it typically emphasizes an extreme example or surprise, indicating that something applies *even to* a case that might be unexpected. 「だに」, on the other hand, focuses on the *minimal* action or thought sufficient to trigger a strong feeling, or the absolute absence of *any* action (in negative forms), often carrying a more literary or dramatic nuance."

            "term": "すら",
            "meaning": "even; (not) even",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「すら」 is similar to 「さえ」 in meaning 'even', but it is generally more formal and often used to express a negative or critical nuance, implying an extreme or surprising lack. While both can be used in negative contexts (e.g., 「すらしない」 vs. 「だにしない」), 「だに」 often carries a more archaic or literary feel, particularly emphasizing a fundamental or shocking absence of action or consideration."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To differentiate between 「だに」 and its close counterparts, consider the level of formality and the depth of emphasis. 「だに」 elevates the expression, adding a literary and dramatic quality to the idea of 'just' or 'not even'. If you want to convey a profound emotional reaction to a minimal stimulus, or an absolute, almost scandalous, lack of action or consideration, 「だに」 is often the most impactful choice. For more straightforward statements of 'even' or 'just by', 「さえ」, 「すら」, or 「だけでも」 are more commonly used and less formal.",
