        "function": "Emphasizes that a minimal action or thought is sufficient to evoke a strong feeling, or highlights a complete lack of action or consideration.",
        "nuance": "「だに」 imparts a strong, often literary, tone. When used with verbs, it intensifies the emotional impact of the act of merely doing or thinking something. When paired with 「～しない」, it underscores an absolute absence of action, often implying negligence or extreme indifference. It is far more formal and less common in daily conversation than similar expressions.",
        "source": "resources/original/dojg/all/だに.yaml",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a correlative particle, linking the preceding minimal action or thought to a subsequent emotional or behavioral outcome."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「だに」 is believed to have originated from classical Japanese. While its exact etymology is debated, one theory suggests it evolved from a combination of 「だ」 (a form of the copula) and 「に」 (a particle indicating location or direction). Over time, it developed its unique function of emphasizing an extreme condition or the minimal threshold for something to occur. Its usage is rooted in older literary forms and retains a formal, sometimes archaic, flavor.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「だに」 is a sophisticated grammatical element primarily found in formal writing and elevated speech. It serves two main functions: either to express that merely thinking about or performing an action is enough to trigger a profound emotional response, or to emphasize a complete absence of an action, even a very minor one.\n\nWhen combined with a verb in its dictionary form (e.g., 「思うだに」, 「考えるだに」), 「だに」 signifies that 'just' or 'merely' engaging in that action is sufficient to produce a strong feeling. This feeling is often negative, such as fear (恐ろしい), embarrassment (恥ずかしい), or disgust (嫌悪感), but it can also convey strong envy (羨ましい) or admiration. It highlights the intensity of the emotion relative to the simplicity of the trigger.\n\nConversely, when 「だに」 is used in the negative form 「～だにしない」, it emphasizes that the subject 'doesn't even' perform a certain action. This construction implies an absolute lack of action or consideration, often suggesting indifference, neglect, or an unexpected omission. For example, 「注意だにしない」 means 'doesn't even pay attention' or 'doesn't even warn'. This usage stresses the extreme degree of inaction. Because of its formal and somewhat archaic nature, 「だに」 is generally not used in casual conversation.",
