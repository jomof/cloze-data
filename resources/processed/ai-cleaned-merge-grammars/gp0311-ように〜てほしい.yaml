    "etymology": "This grammar point is a combination of 「ように」(meaning \"like, in order to\") and 「てほしい」(meaning \"want someone to do something\").",
    "writeup": "「ように〜てほしい」 combines the auxiliary verb 「ようだ」 with the 「てほしい」 structure, indicating that you or someone else wants someone to do something. 「ようだ」 takes the adverbial form 「ように」 when linked to a verb later in the sentence. This expression highlights that you want someone to do something \"in the way of (A)\" or \"so that (A)\" happens. When 「ように」 follows a noun, 「の」 is required. Either 「に」 or 「が」 may mark the thing that the speaker wants to happen, with 「に」 often marking people and 「が」 marking events or objects. Note that 「が」 and 「に」 may be switched to avoid repetition or confusion about the subject of the sentence.",

Focus on the presence of both the 「ように」 indicating manner or means, and the 「てほしい」 indicating a desire for action. When you want to state a simple desire, use 「がほしい」 or 「てほしい」. When you want to indicate an effort, use 「ようにする」. When you want to describe instructions, use 「ようにいう」. Only use 「ように〜てほしい」 when expressing a desire for someone to act in a specific way to achieve a particular goal or state."
