        "function": "Connects a preceding statement (often a quote or reported content) to a subsequent noun, specifying the nature of that content (e.g., a report, a notice, an opinion).",
        "nuance": "Carries a more formal or official tone than similar expressions like 「という」, often used in written communication, news, or formal announcements. It directly attributes the preceding content to the specific noun that follows it, such as 「報告」 (report), 「見解」 (view), or 「通知」 (notice)."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「との」 is a compound form, combining the quotative particle 「と」 and the nominative/attributive particle 「の」. Historically, 「と」 has marked direct or indirect speech, thoughts, and content. 「の」, in this context, functions to nominalize the preceding clause, making it an attribute of the following noun. Thus, 「との」 effectively means \"of that which was said/thought\" or \"that which is said to be,\" creating a strong and formal link between the reported content and the noun describing the communication.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「との」 is a compound particle formed by the quotative particle 「と」 and the case-marking particle 「の」. This construction serves to present the preceding statement as the content of the following noun. It is frequently encountered in formal writing, news reports, official announcements, and academic contexts. While 「と」 can simply indicate a direct quote, the addition of 「の」 creates a more attributive relationship, emphasizing that the preceding information *is* the content of the subsequent noun. This makes it particularly suitable for linking reported speech, opinions, or facts to nouns that describe types of communication or information, such as: \n*   **報告** (ほうこく - report)\n*   **見解** (けんかい - view, opinion)\n*   **通知** (つうち - notice)\n*   **知らせ** (しらせ - news, announcement)\n*   **意向** (いこう - intention)\n*   **指摘** (してき - pointing out)\n*   **依頼** (いらい - request)\n\nFor nouns and な-adjectives, the copula 「だ」 may precede 「との」, but it is often omitted, especially in concise or formal contexts. The omission of 「だ」 maintains a higher level of formality. This grammar point provides a concise and direct way to convey authoritative information, making it a staple in advanced Japanese communication.",

In contrast, 「という」 is broader; it can define something, specify a name or title, or introduce a general statement, and doesn't always require a subsequent noun that clarifies the type of communication.
