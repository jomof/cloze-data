    "etymology": "「はともかく」 makes use of the adverbial-particle 「は」 and the adverb 「兎も角」 which means \"to set aside\" or \"at any rate\". The adverb 「兎も角」 is thought to have come from the Buddhist expression 「兎角亀毛 (とかくきもう)」, meaning \"horns on rabbits, fur on turtles,\" referring to things that do not exist. Although this particular meaning is not widely accepted as being strongly related to the modern meaning of 「兎も角」, some relation can be drawn between it and English phrases such as \"(A) is neither here nor there\" in reference to something that is nonexistent or of little importance.",
    "writeup": "「はともかく」 is used when the speaker wants to shift the topic from (A) to (B), or to mention (B) as something additional on top of (A). It's primarily seen following nouns. Often, (A) is something the speaker considers not worth dwelling on, with (B) being the more important point. It is roughly equivalent to 'setting aside,' 'regardless of,' or 'leaving aside'. This expression sees general usage across various registers and ages, without specific gender or regional associations.",
