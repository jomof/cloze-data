    "etymology": "たい is believed to have originated from the verb 「足る (たりる)」 (tariru), meaning \"to be sufficient\" or \"to be enough.\" Over time, it evolved to express a sense of wanting something to be 'enough' or 'sufficient' in the context of one's desires.",
    "writeup": "たい is an auxiliary verb that expresses a desire to do something. It attaches to the ます-stem of a verb (the same form you use before ます). たい itself conjugates like an い-adjective. Therefore, you can use forms like たくない (negative), たかった (past), and たくなかった (negative past). When expressing the object of your desire, you can use either the を or が particle, with が often implying a stronger desire. It is **important** to remember that たい primarily expresses your own desires or asks about others' desires. Avoid using it to guess what others want, except in direct questions. Also, use 〜てほしい when you want someone *else* to do something for you, and 〜ませんか when inviting someone to do something with you.",
