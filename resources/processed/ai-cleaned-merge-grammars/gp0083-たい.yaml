        "grammatical-role": "Functions similarly to an adjective, modifying the action it describes.",
        "logical-flow": "Describes the speaker's internal state regarding an action."
    },
    "etymology": "The auxiliary adjective 「たい」 is believed to have evolved from classical Japanese forms expressing desire or inclination. While its precise origin is complex, it is often linked to the verb 「足る (たりる)」 (tariru), meaning \"to be sufficient\" or \"to be enough.\" This connection suggests an underlying nuance of wanting something to be 'enough' or 'sufficient' to satisfy a desire. Over time, its usage became grammaticalized to specifically indicate a personal wish or aspiration to perform an action, differentiating it from expressions of wanting objects.",
    "writeup": "The auxiliary adjective 「たい」 is used to express one's desire to perform an action, translating to \"want to do\" or \"would like to do.\" It attaches directly to the **ます-stem** of a verb. For example, from 食べます (tabemasu), the ます-stem is 食べ (tabe), so 食べたい (tabetai) means \"want to eat.\"\n\n「たい」 conjugates exactly like an **い-adjective**. This means its negative form is 「たくない」, its past form is 「たかった」, and its negative past form is 「たくなかった」. Polite forms include 「たいです」, 「たくないです」, 「たかったです」, and 「たくなかったです」.\n\n### Usage with Particles を and が\n\nWhen expressing the object of the desired action, both the 「を」 particle and the 「が」 particle can be used. For instance, you can say 「寿司を食べたい (sushi o tabetai)」 or 「寿司が食べたい (sushi ga tabetai)」. While both are grammatically correct, using 「が」 often implies a **stronger, more specific desire** for that particular object, highlighting it as the focus of the wanting. The 「を」 particle tends to indicate a more general desire to perform the action.\n\n### Speaker and Context\n\n「たい」 is primarily used for expressing **the speaker's own desires**. In declarative sentences, it almost exclusively refers to the first person. For example, 「私は日本に行きたい (Watashi wa Nihon ni ikitai)」 means \"I want to go to Japan.\"\n\nWhen asking about someone else's desires (second person), 「たい」 is used in **interrogative sentences**. For example, 「あなたは何がしたいですか？ (Anata wa nani ga shitai desu ka?)」 means \"What do you want to do?\"\n\nIt is generally **not used to guess or state what a third person wants** without direct evidence or questioning. For third-person desires that are observable or inferred, the auxiliary verb 「たがる」 (tagaru) or 「がる」 (garu) is typically used (e.g., 「彼は日本に行きたがっている (Kare wa Nihon ni ikitagatte iru)」 - \"He seems to want to go to Japan.\"). However, it can be used for the third person if it's a direct quote or something the speaker knows for a fact (e.g., 「彼が日本に行きたいと言いました (Kare ga Nihon ni ikitai to iimashita)」 - \"He said he wants to go to Japan.\").\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n*   **Not for Commands/Requests**: Do not use 「たい」 to tell someone else what you want them to do. For that, use expressions like 「〜てほしい」 (te hoshii), meaning \"I want you to do...\"\n*   **Not for Invitations**: While 「〜ませんか」 (masen ka) or 「〜ましょうか」 (mashō ka) are common for invitations, 「たい」 is generally not used for inviting someone to do something *with* you. For example, instead of 「映画を見たいですか？ (Eiga o mitai desu ka?)」 (Do you want to see a movie? - sounds like asking about their personal desire), you would typically say 「映画を見ませんか？ (Eiga o mimasen ka?)」 (Why don't we see a movie?) to invite them.\n\nUnderstanding these nuances is key to using 「たい」 naturally and appropriately in Japanese.",
