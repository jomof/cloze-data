        "logical-flow": "Describes the speaker's internal state regarding an action performing an action and then feeling the desired outcome or state. It highlights the internal drive towards achieving the action's result or experience. This is a core expression of volition aligned with the speaker's internal state, not an external command or observation. It differs from simply stating what one needs (必要だ) or intends (するつもりだ) by emphasizing the emotional aspect of longing or wishing for the action. The grammar point's structure, attaching to the ます-stem of a verb, underscores that the desire is intrinsically linked to the action itself, making it a verb-centric expression of wanting rather than a noun-centric one. This subtle yet significant difference guides its appropriate usage in expressing personal aspiration rather than a detached intention or requirement. Thus, the flow begins with the internal desire, moves to the action, and concludes with the satisfaction of that desire, whether achieved or merely imagined. This grammatical construction directly reflects the human psychological process of desire-driven action, where the internal state leads to the contemplated action. The 'internal state' aspect is crucial, as 「たい」 inherently implies a subjective feeling, making it suitable for expressing one's own desires or asking about another's, but less so for objectively stating a third person's desire, for which 「たがる」 or 「がる」 are preferred, as they describe observable behavior. This distinction emphasizes the subjective, first-person nature of 「たい」 and its role in conveying personal volition versus external observation or command. The grammatical structure allows for a fluid expression of desire, adapting to various contexts and tenses by behaving like an い-adjective, thereby enabling nuanced expressions of wanting to do something, or not wanting to, or having wanted to, all stemming from the same core internal state of desire. Therefore, the logical flow is: Internal Desire → Action → (Potential) Fulfillment/Non-Fulfillment, with the speaker's personal volition at the core of the expression. This highlights the intrinsic connection between the desire and the action, forming a complete semantic unit that conveys personal aspiration clearly and directly."
    },
    "etymology": "The auxiliary adjective 「たい」 is believed to have evolved from classical Japanese forms expressing desire or inclination. While its precise origin is complex, it is often linked to the verb 「足る (たりる)」 (tariru), meaning \"to be sufficient\" or \"to be enough.\" This connection suggests an underlying nuance of wanting something to be 'enough' or 'sufficient' to satisfy a desire. Over time, its usage became grammaticalized to specifically indicate a personal wish or aspiration to perform an action, differentiating it from expressions of wanting objects.",
    "writeup": "The auxiliary adjective 「たい」 is used to express one's desire to perform an action, translating to \"want to do\" or \"would like to do.\" It attaches directly to the **ます-stem** of a verb. For example, from 食べます (tabemasu), the ます-stem is 食べ (tabe), so 食べたい (tabetai) means \"want to eat.\"\n\n「たい」 conjugates exactly like an **い-adjective**. This means its negative form is 「たくない」, its past form is 「たかった」, and its negative past form is 「たくなかった」. Polite forms include 「たいです」, 「たくないです」, 「たかったです」, and 「たくなかったです」.\n\n### Usage with Particles を and が\n\nWhen expressing the object of the desired action, both the 「を」 particle and the 「が」 particle can be used. For instance, you can say 「寿司を食べたい (sushi o tabetai)」 or 「寿司が食べたい (sushi ga tabetai)」. While both are grammatically correct, using 「が」 often implies a **stronger, more specific desire** for that particular object, highlighting it as the focus of the wanting. The 「を」 particle tends to indicate a more general desire to perform the action.\n\n### Speaker and Context\n\n「たい」 is primarily used for expressing **the speaker's own desires**. In declarative sentences, it almost exclusively refers to the first person. For example, 「私は日本に行きたい (Watashi wa Nihon ni ikitai)」 means \"I want to go to Japan.\"\n\nWhen asking about someone else's desires (second person), 「たい」 is used in **interrogative sentences**. For example, 「あなたは何がしたいですか？ (Anata wa nani ga shitai desu ka?)」 means \"What do you want to do?\"\n\nIt is generally **not used to guess or state what a third person wants** without direct evidence or questioning. For third-person desires that are observable or inferred, the auxiliary verb 「たがる」 (tagaru) or 「がる」 (garu) is typically used (e.g., 「彼は日本に行きたがっている (Kare wa Nihon ni ikitagatte iru)」 - \"He seems to want to go to Japan.\"). However, it can be used for the third person if it's a direct quote or something the speaker knows for a fact (e.g., 「彼が日本に行きたいと言いました (Kare ga Nihon ni ikitai to iimashita)」 - \"He said he wants to go to Japan.\").\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n*   **Not for Commands/Requests**: Do not use 「たい」 to tell someone else what you want them to do. For that, use expressions like 「〜てほしい」 (te hoshii), meaning \"I want you to do...\"\n*   **Not for Invitations**: While 「〜ませんか」 (masen ka) or 「〜ましょうか」 (mashō ka) are common for invitations, 「たい」 is generally not used for inviting someone to do something *with* you. For example, instead of 「映画を見たいですか？ (Eiga o mitai desu ka?)」 (Do you want to see a movie? - sounds like asking about their personal desire), you would typically say 「映画を見ませんか？ (Eiga o mimasen ka?)」 (Why don't we see a movie?)\n\nUnderstanding these nuances is key to using 「たい」 naturally and appropriately in Japanese.",

            "nuance": "「たがる」 is used to describe what a third person *appears* to want based on observation, whereas 「たい」 is used for expressing *your own* direct desires. They can be used when the speaker is a third party, and they cannot directly know the feelings of the person they are talking about. You could say 「彼 は ゲーム が 欲しい です」 instead of 「彼 は ゲーム を 欲しがっ て い ます」 if you are referring to a desire that the third person has expressed to you, for example. It is not necessarily wrong to use 「が欲しい」 for third persons when you are certain of their feelings based on their communication, but it is often more natural to use 「たがる」 to express desires of third parties, as it emphasizes that it is an observation of their behavior rather than a direct statement of their feelings. The nuance is that 「たがる」 implies observation of outward signs of desire, such as actions or words, rather than directly knowing the person's internal feelings. For example, a child pointing at a toy would be described with 「欲しがっている」. This is a common point of confusion for learners, but understanding the difference between direct knowledge (which can allow 「〜が欲しい」 with a third person if explicitly stated by them) and inferred desire (which typically uses 「たがる」 or 「がる」) is crucial for natural communication. The key is that 「たがる」 makes the speaker's knowledge explicit: they infer the desire based on observed behavior. Therefore, 「たがる」 and 「がる」 are more commonly used when discussing what a third person desires, even if you are certain of their feelings, because it is always an observation from your side, not a direct feeling. This highlights the Japanese tendency to express things from an external, observational perspective when referring to others' internal states, rather than assuming direct knowledge."
