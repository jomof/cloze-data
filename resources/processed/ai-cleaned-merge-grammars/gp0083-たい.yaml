    "etymology": "The auxiliary verb 「たい」 is derived from the adjective 「たし」 (tashi), meaning 'sufficient' or 'satisfying.' Over time, 「たし」 evolved to express the idea of wanting something to be 'sufficient' or 'satisfying,' eventually becoming the modern 「たい」 to indicate desire.",
    "writeup": "「たい」 is an auxiliary verb attached to the ます-stem of a verb to express a desire or wish to do something. It functions similarly to an い-adjective and conjugates accordingly. For example, the negative form is 「たくない」 (takunai), and the past form is 「たかった」 (takatta). While 「たい」 expresses the speaker's desires, it's generally not used to talk about what someone *else* wants unless you are asking them directly.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   When using 「たい」, the object of desire can be marked with either 「を」 or 「が」. The nuance is subtle; 「が」 often implies a stronger desire.\n*   To express wanting someone else to do something, use 「〜てほしい」 instead of 「たい」.\n*   「たい」 is typically not used in invitations. Use 「〜ませんか」 instead, as it is more natural.",
