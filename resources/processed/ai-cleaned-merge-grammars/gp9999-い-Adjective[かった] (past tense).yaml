grammar_point: い-Adjective[かった] (past tense)
matcher: '{i-adjective-past}'
id: gp9999
meaning: Plain past tense form of i-adjectives
pronunciation:
  katakana: カッタ
  romaji: katta
formation:
  い-Adjective (stem) + かった: Forms the plain past tense for i-adjectives. For example, 嬉しい (ureshii) becomes
    嬉しかった (ureshikatta).
  い-Adjective (stem) + くなかった: Forms the plain negative past tense for i-adjectives. For example, 寒い (samui)
    becomes 寒くなかった (samukunakatta).
  'Irregular い-Adjective: いい/良い (ii/yoi) + かった': Forms the irregular past tense 良かった (yokatta).
jlpt: N5
etymology: The past tense suffix 「かった」 has evolved from older Japanese forms. The 「か」 component is often
  linked to an ancient auxiliary verb 「けり」 which served as a past tense marker, and the 「た」 part is the
  more modern plain past tense suffix, originating from the auxiliary verb 「たり」. This combination formed
  the common past tense ending for i-adjectives, consolidating over centuries. The irregular conjugation
  of 「いい」 to 「よかった」 is a remnant of an older form 「よい」, which was the more common pronunciation of 「良い」
  in classical Japanese.
writeup: The suffix 「かった」 is used to form the plain past tense of い-adjectives. It directly replaces the
  final 「い」 of the adjective. This form is casual and commonly used in conversations among friends, family,
  or when speaking to oneself. For formal or polite contexts, 「かったです」 is appended after the 「かった」 form.
  A notable exception to this rule is the i-adjective 「いい」 (good), which irregularly conjugates to 「よかった」
  (yokatta) in the plain past tense, not 「いかった」. This irregularity comes from the historical form 「よい」
  (yoi) which was the standard form of 'good' before 「いい」 became more prevalent. Understanding this basic
  conjugation is crucial for expressing past states or qualities in Japanese.

  - term: な-Adjective[だった]
    meaning: Plain past tense of na-adjectives
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「い-Adjective[かった]」 which replaces the final 「い」, 「な-Adjective[だった]」 attaches to the
      stem of a na-adjective (e.g., 「きれいだった」 for 'was clean') to form its plain past tense.

  - term: Verb[た]
    meaning: Plain past tense of verbs
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「い-Adjective[かった]」 is the plain past tense for adjectives, 「Verb[た]」 is the plain past
      tense ending for verbs. Verbs undergo different conjugation rules to form their 「た」 form (e.g.,
      「食べた」 'ate', 「行った」 'went').

  - term: い-Adjective[くなかった]
    meaning: Plain negative past tense of i-adjectives
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This form indicates that an i-adjective was *not* the case in the past. It is formed by replacing
      the final 「い」 with 「くなかった」 (e.g., 「忙しくなかった」 'was not busy').
    grammar_point: い-Adjective (past negative)
post_false_friends_writeup: While these forms all indicate past tense, paying close attention to whether
  the word is an i-adjective, na-adjective, or verb is essential. Each word type follows distinct rules
  for its past tense formation. The negative past forms, like 「い-Adjective[くなかった]」, simply combine the
  negative and past concepts specific to i-adjectives.
