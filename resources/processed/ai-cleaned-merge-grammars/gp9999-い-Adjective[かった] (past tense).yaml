jlpt: N5
etymology: The `〜かった` ending for い-adjectives, denoting past tense, is a unique historical development.
  It is believed to have originated from the stem of the い-adjective combined with the classical past
  auxiliary verb `き` (which changed to `け` and eventually fused to `かった`). This contrasts with how nouns
  and な-adjectives form their past tense (using `だった`). This distinct origin highlights the fundamental
  grammatical difference between い-adjectives and other parts of speech in Japanese.
writeup: |-
  The `い-Adjective[かった]` form is the plain past tense of い-adjectives. To form this, you remove the final 「い」 from the dictionary form of an い-adjective and append 「かった」. For example, 「高い」(takai - high) becomes 「高かった」(takakatta - was high), and 「美味しい」(oishii - delicious) becomes 「美味しかった」(oishikatta - was delicious).

  This form is used to describe something that *was* a certain way in the past. It expresses an affirmative past state. For example, if you want to say "The book was interesting," you would use 「面白かった」 (omoshirokatta) because 「面白い」 (omoshiroi) is an い-adjective.

  While 「かった」 itself is a plain form, it can be made polite by adding 「です」 (e.g., 「高かったです」, 「美味しかったです」). This polite form is commonly used in everyday conversations.

  Understanding `い-Adjective[かった]` is crucial for building past tense sentences involving descriptions, as it's one of the most basic and frequently used grammatical structures in Japanese.
false_friends:
  - term: じゃなかった
    meaning: was not
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike `〜かった` which is the affirmative past for い-adjectives, `じゃなかった` is the plain negative
      past for nouns and な-adjectives (e.g., 「学生じゃなかった」wasn't a student, 「元気じゃなかった」wasn't energetic).
    grammar_point: じゃなかった (was not)
  - term: い-Adjective (past negative)
    meaning: was not [adjective]
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This form uses `〜くなかった` (e.g., 「高くなかった」wasn't high). While it applies to い-adjectives and
      is in the past tense, it expresses the negative meaning, directly contrasting with the affirmative
      meaning of `〜かった`.
    grammar_point: い-Adjective (past negative)
  - term: Verb[なかった]
    meaning: did not do
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: This is the plain past negative form for verbs (e.g., 「食べなかった」didn't eat). It applies to actions
      and indicates that an action did not occur in the past, distinct from `〜かった` which describes a past
      state for い-adjectives.
    grammar_point: Verb[なかった] (past negative)
post_false_friends_writeup: While `い-Adjective[かった]` describes a past affirmative state, it is important
  to distinguish it from similar-sounding or functionally similar expressions. `じゃなかった` is used for nouns
  and な-adjectives in their past negative form. The past negative form of い-adjectives is `〜くなかった`, which,
  though related, expresses the opposite meaning. Finally, `Verb[なかった]` is exclusively for verbs, indicating
  a past action that did not happen. Pay attention to the part of speech and whether the meaning is affirmative
  or negative.

post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, the `い-Adjective[かった]` form is versatile and fundamental
  for expressing past states with い-adjectives. Remember to drop the final 「い」 before adding 「かった」. The
  formality can be adjusted by adding 「です」 for polite speech.
