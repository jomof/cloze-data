    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とは限らない」 is composed of 「と」 (a particle indicating content), 「は」 (a topic marker), and 「限らない」 (the negative form of the verb 「限る」 *to limit*). Thus, it literally means \"it is not limited to saying that\".",
    "writeup": "「とは限らない」 is used to express that something is **not necessarily** the case, or that there is **no guarantee** that something will happen. It indicates that although something may seem likely or typical, it is not always true. This expression can be used with verbs, *i*-adjectives, *na*-adjectives, and nouns. When used with *na*-adjectives and nouns, 「だ」 is required before 「とは限らない」.",
