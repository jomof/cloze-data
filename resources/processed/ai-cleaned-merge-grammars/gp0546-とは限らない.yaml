    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とは限らない」 is composed of 「と」 (a particle indicating content), 「は」 (a topic marker), and 「限らない」 (the negative form of the verb 「限る」 *to limit*). Thus, it literally means \"it is not limited to saying that\".",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「とは限らない」 is used to express that something is **not necessarily** the case or that there is **no guarantee** that something will happen. It signifies that while a certain outcome or state might seem expected or implied, it is not definitively true or always limited to that possibility. This expression is formed by taking the negative plain form of the verb 「限る」(かぎる), meaning 'to limit' or 'to be confined to', along with the particle 「と」, which introduces the content of what is being negated, and the topic marker 「は」. It literally conveys the idea that 'it is not limited to (or confined by) saying that...'. This structure can be appended to verbs, *i*-adjectives, *na*-adjectives, and nouns. When preceding 「とは限らない」, *na*-adjectives and nouns require the copula 「だ」 (or 「であった」 for past tense) before the 「と」 particle.",
