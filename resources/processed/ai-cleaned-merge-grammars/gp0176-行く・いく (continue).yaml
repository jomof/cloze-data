    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ていく」 is derived from the verb 「行く」(iku), meaning \"to go.\" When attached to the te-form of another verb, it signifies the continuation of that verb's action, implying a sense of moving forward in time. It can also imply that the action or state will continue from now into the future. This is distinct from 「てくる」(te kuru) which means 'to come' and describes an action that started in the past and has continued up to the present.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ていく」 (te iku) indicates the continuation of an action or a gradual change over time. It is formed by attaching 「いく」 (iku) to the te-form of a verb.  It's like saying something will \"go on\" happening or that it will gradually \"become\" a certain way. The starting point of the action or change can be either in the present or the past. For example, 「これから寒くなっていく」 (kore kara samuku natte iku) means \"it will get colder from now on\" and continue to be that way.  This grammar point is commonly used in everyday conversation and writing.",
