        "function": "Indicates the continuation or progression of an action or a gradual change over time, often implying movement away from the current state or point of origin.",
        "nuance": "This auxiliary verb adds a sense of progression or movement away from the speaker's current position or a past point in time. It describes a change that unfolds over time, distinguishing it from a static state or an action that happens at a single moment. It can describe physical movement away or a metaphorical 'movement' into the future or a new state."
    },
    "etymology": "The auxiliary verb 「行く」, *iku*, literally means \"to go\". When attached to the te-form of another verb, it describes the continuation or progression of that action or state from a certain point forward, metaphorically extending the idea of 'going' to the action itself. The directional aspect of 'going' is thus transferred to the ongoing process, implying a movement away from the start point of the action or change.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「～ていく」, *te iku*, is used to express the continuation of an action or a gradual change from a certain point in time. This 'point in time' can be the present moment, indicating what will continue to happen in the future, or a point in the past, describing what has continued since then. The nuance of 「いく」 here is that the action or change progresses and moves *away* from the starting point, whether physically or metaphorically. Think of it as \"going on\" or \"keeping\" in English, but with an inherent sense of outward movement or progression over time.\n\nFor example, if you say 「寒くなっていく」, it means it's getting colder and the coldness is progressing or moving away from the current state, suggesting a continued decline in temperature. Similarly, 「話していく」 implies continuing to talk, with the conversation moving forward from its current point. This contrasts with other expressions of continuation that do not carry the directional nuance of 「いく」.\n\nWhile 「～ていく」 itself is not gender-specific, the context and accompanying vocabulary can influence the overall tone and perceived register. It is widely used across all age groups and in various situations.",

            "nuance": "「～ていく」 implies progression or movement *away* from the speaker or a specific point in time, suggesting a future-oriented or departing direction. 「～てくる」, its counterpart, implies progression or movement *towards* the speaker or a past-to-present direction, suggesting something that has continued up to the present or is approaching."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「～ていく」 emphasizes the continuation or progression of an action or state *from* a certain point forward. 「～始める」 focuses specifically on the *commencement* or *initiation* of an action, indicating when it started rather than its ongoing development."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When using 「～ていく」, it is essential to distinguish it from the plain verb 「行く」, which simply means \"to go.\" While both involve the word 「行く」, their grammatical functions and meanings are distinct. The auxiliary 「～ていく」 is always preceded by a verb in its te-form.\n\nFurthermore, pay close attention to the contrast between 「～ていく」 and 「～てくる」. The former emphasizes a sense of moving forward or away from a current state or point of origin, implying a future-oriented or outward progression. For example, 「暖かくなっていく」 means it is gradually becoming warmer, moving away from a colder state. The latter, 「～てくる」, indicates a movement towards the speaker, either literally or metaphorically, suggesting that something has continued from a past point up to the present, or is approaching. For example, 「暖かくなってくる」 would mean it is gradually becoming warmer as it approaches the present moment or the speaker's location. Understanding this directional nuance is key to using these expressions correctly.\n\nFinally, compare 「～ていく」 with 「～始める」. While both relate to processes, 「～始める」 focuses on the *initiation* of an action or state (e.g., 「走り始める」 - to start running), indicating the very beginning. In contrast, 「～ていく」 describes the *continuation* or *progression* of an action *from* a certain point (e.g., 「走っていく」 - to continue running, to run off). 「～始める」 marks the starting line, while 「～ていく」 describes the journey itself, moving forward from that line.",
