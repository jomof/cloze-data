        "usage-context": "Evaluative and critical contexts, often used to emphasize a foundational issue.",
        "nuance": "Often carries a strong tone of criticism or emphasis, highlighting that a fundamental issue must be addressed before the explicitly stated point can even be considered. It implies a significant gap or failing in basic requirements.",
        "colocation": "Often followed by に or の, connecting to a subsequent verb or noun. Frequently used with phrases that denote a fundamental problem or lack, such as 「問題だ」 (it's a problem) or 「話にならない」 (it's not worth talking about).",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions adverbially, modifying the preceding noun, verb, or adjective, and emphasizing a foundational issue.",
        "logical-flow": "Establishes a hierarchy of importance, asserting that the point preceding 以前 is a more foundational or urgent matter than the one being discussed.",
        "temporal-flow": "While it can refer to time, its primary function here is to indicate a logical precedence of importance, rather than a strict chronological order.",
        "spatial-flow": "Does not typically involve spatial concepts; it primarily operates on abstract or logical relationships."
    },
    "etymology": "以前 (izen) is composed of the kanji 以 (i), meaning \"by means of; because of; in view of,\" and 前 (zen), meaning \"before; in front.\" Thus, 以前 literally means \"before\" or \"prior to\" something, but carries a stronger emphasis and often a critical nuance compared to just 前 (mae). It signifies that a prior, more fundamental issue must be addressed, drawing its critical edge from the implication that one should not even be at the point of considering the stated matter.",
    "writeup": "When used as a suffix, 以前 (izen) functions to indicate that a topic does not even fulfill the minimum requirements of what precedes it, and therefore a more fundamental issue needs to be addressed before considering the stated matter. This often translates to expressions like \"before even (A),\" \"not even (A),\" or \"far from (A)\" in English, and is commonly used to express criticism or to highlight something thoughtless or irresponsible.\n\n以前 attaches directly after nouns, verbs in their dictionary form, い-adjectives, or な-adjectives. It is typically followed by either the case-marking particle に or の. The choice between に and の depends on whether 以前 is linking to a subsequent verb (に) or noun (の). When に is used, 以前 に acts adverbially, often leading to a verb. When の is used, 以前 の acts adjectivally, modifying a subsequent noun.\n\nWhile 前 (mae) simply means \"before\" in a chronological sense, 以前 highlights a larger, more significant distance in terms of prerequisite or logical precedence. It acts as an emphatic version of 前, and it is this emphasis that often conveys the tone of criticism. It implies that a certain condition or action is so basic that it should have been dealt with \"way before\" or \"long before\" the current discussion or situation arose. This makes it particularly useful for pointing out foundational flaws or neglected fundamental steps.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid mixing up 以前 with similar expressions, remember that 以前 often carries a tone of criticism or emphasis, highlighting that something should be considered before even reaching a certain point due to a more fundamental issue.
