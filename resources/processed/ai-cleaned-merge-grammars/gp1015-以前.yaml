    "etymology": "以前 (izen) is composed of the kanji 以 (i), meaning \"by means of; because of; in view of,\" and 前 (zen), meaning \"before; in front.\" Thus, 以前 literally means \"before\" or \"prior to\" something, but carries a stronger emphasis and often a critical nuance compared to just 前 (mae).",
    "writeup": "When used as a suffix, 以前 (izen), meaning ‘preceding’ or ‘prior to,’ indicates that a topic doesn't even fulfill the minimum requirements of (A) and should be considered before that minimum. It often translates to “before even (A)” and is used to criticize something considered thoughtless or irresponsible.\n\n以前 appears directly after nouns, dictionary form verbs, い-adjectives, or な-adjectives. It's usually followed by the case-marking particle に or の, depending on whether it connects to a verb or noun.\n\n以前 highlights larger distances in the past than 前 (mae) alone, functioning as an emphatic version of 前. This emphasis often gives rise to the tone of criticism, implying ‘way before (A), (B)’ or ‘long before you even think of (A), (B).’",
