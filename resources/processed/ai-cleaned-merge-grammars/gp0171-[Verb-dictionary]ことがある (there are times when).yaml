pronunciation:
  katakana: コトガアル
  romaji: koto ga aru
formation:
  Verb (dictionary form) + ことがある: Used to express that an action or event sometimes happens.
  Verb (negative plain form) + ことがある: Used to express that an action or event sometimes does not happen.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to express occasional occurrences or possibilities, often reflecting a speaker's
    observation of patterns.
  function: Expresses a possibility or occasional occurrence.
  nuance: Implies that something happens sometimes, but not necessarily frequently or regularly. It suggests
    an observation of a pattern rather than a strong likelihood for a specific future event.
  colocation: Often used with frequency adverbs like 時々 or たまに。
  grammatical-role: Forms a predicate or part of a predicate, describing occasional actions or states.
  logical-flow: Describes a situation that is true at certain, intermittent points.
etymology: The construction Verb-dictionary + ことがある literally translates to 'there is the matter/fact
  of [verb-ing]'. The こと (koto) nominalizes the preceding verb, allowing ある (aru) (to exist) to express
  the occasional existence or occurrence of that action or state. This grammatical pattern evolved to
  describe events that happen 'sometimes' or 'occasionally', signifying that the instance of the action
  exists.
writeup: |-
  The grammar pattern Verb (dictionary form) + ことがある is used to describe actions or states that occur occasionally or sometimes. It literally means 'there is the event/instance of [verb-ing]'. The こと (koto) acts as a nominalizer, transforming the preceding verb into a noun phrase, which is then followed by ある (aru) (to exist), indicating the occasional existence of that event.

  This pattern is distinct from Verb (た-form) + ことがある, which refers to past experiences ('have done something before'). While V-taことがある focuses on whether an experience has occurred at least once, V-dictionary + ことがある indicates that an event happens intermittently or from time to time. It is also different from ～ている for habitual actions, as ことがある suggests a less consistent or regular occurrence.

  It can be used for observations about general tendencies or possibilities. For example, if you say 「日本語 の 勉強 は 難しい ことがある」 (Nihongo no benkyou wa muzukashii koto ga aru), it means 'Japanese study is sometimes difficult', acknowledging that difficulty is an occasional aspect.

  You can also use this pattern with the negative form of a verb to express that something sometimes does not happen. For instance, 「彼 は 時々 学校 に 来ない ことがある」 (Kare wa tokidoki gakkou ni konai koto ga aru) means 'Sometimes he doesn't come to school'.

  - term: '[Verb-た]ことがある'
    meaning: To have the experience of doing something
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While V-dictionary + ことがある indicates occasional occurrences, V-た + ことがある describes having
      a past experience.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-た]ことがある (experience of having done)'
  - term: '[Adj-stem]・[V-stem]そうだ'
    meaning: Looks like; seems like
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「～そうだ」 expresses a visual or sensory appearance, implying immediate observation. 「～ことがある」
      expresses occasional occurrences based on general observation or pattern.
    grammar_point: '[Adj・V-stem]そうだ (it looks・seems like)'
  - term: かもしれない
    meaning: Might, maybe, probably
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～かもしれない」 expresses a specific possibility or likelihood for a single event or state, often
      with uncertainty. 「～ことがある」 describes a general, intermittent pattern of occurrence.
    grammar_point: かもしれない (might・maybe)
  - term: 傾向がある
    meaning: To have a tendency to; to show a trend
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～傾向がある」 implies a stronger, more consistent trend or inclination. 「～ことがある」 is for less regular,
      occasional events, not necessarily a trend.
    grammar_point: 傾向がある (neutral tendency)
  - term: たまに
    meaning: Occasionally, rarely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たまに」 is an adverb describing frequency. 「～ことがある」 is a grammatical pattern indicating that
      something happens sometimes; they are often used together but serve different grammatical functions.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:たまに (occasionally)
post_false_friends_writeup: While V-dictionary + ことがある signals that an event happens from time to time,
  it is crucial to differentiate it from V-た + ことがある, which exclusively denotes past experience. Remember,
  the former speaks to what can happen occasionally, while the latter confirms what has happened at least
  once. Similarly, かもしれない expresses a single, uncertain possibility, whereas ことがある describes a recurring,
  albeit infrequent, phenomenon. Lastly, while 傾向がある indicates a consistent trend, ことがある points to less
  predictable, sporadic occurrences.
