    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に足る」 combines the particle 「に」, indicating a direction or purpose, with the verb 「足る(たる)」, meaning \"to be sufficient\" or \"to be enough.\" Therefore, 「に足る」 literally means \"to be sufficient for\" something.",
    "writeup": "「に足る」 is a formal grammar structure primarily found in written materials like books and speeches. It expresses that something is \"worthy of\" or \"sufficient for\" a particular noun or action. The verb 「足る」 itself means \"to be sufficient.\" 「に足る」 always appears in its dictionary form. It is **important** to remember that when expressing that something is 'not worth' a certain action, you should negate the verb following 「に足る」, rather than trying to negate 「足る」 directly. Be cautious of the word 「足る」 following 「する」, or immediately following the noun that would usually have 「する」 added to it; this puts emphasis on the action. For example, 満足するに足る, rather than 満足に足る.",
