    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に足る」 is derived from the verb 「足る(たる)」, meaning \"to be sufficient\" or \"to be enough\". The particle 「に」 indicates the purpose or standard against which sufficiency is measured. Therefore, 「に足る」 literally means \"to be sufficient for\" or \"to meet the requirements of\" something.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「に足る」 (ni taru) expresses that something is \"worthy of\" or \"sufficient for\" a particular purpose or standard. It is generally used in formal contexts such as books, speeches, or academic writing.\n\n*   **Form**: 「に足る」 follows a noun or a verb in its dictionary form.\n*   「足る」 itself is always in the dictionary form and is followed by a noun it modifies, indicating what is worthy or sufficient.\n*   **Note**: When used with 「する」 verbs, 「に足る」 can either follow 「する」 or directly attach to the noun. When it follows 「する」, there is a greater emphasis on the action itself.\n*   To express that something is \"not worthy,\" negate the following verb rather than 「足る」 itself.",
