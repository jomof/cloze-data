    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に足る」 is derived from the verb 「足る(たる)」, meaning \"to be sufficient\" or \"to be enough\". The particle 「に」 indicates the purpose or standard against which sufficiency is measured. Therefore, 「に足る」 literally means \"to be sufficient for\" or \"to meet the requirements of\" something.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「に足る」 (ni taru) expresses that something is \"worthy of\" or \"sufficient for\" a particular purpose or standard. It is generally used in formal contexts, such as in books, speeches, or academic writing.\n\n**Form**: 「に足る」 typically follows a noun or a verb in its dictionary form. While 「に足る」 often appears in its dictionary form when modifying a noun (e.g., 信頼に足る人物, \"a person worthy of trust\"), the verb 「足る」 itself can be conjugated to express different tenses or modalities, such as in negative or past forms. These conjugations preserve the core meaning of \"to be worthy of\" or \"to be sufficient for\".\n\n**Important Consideration**: When expressing that something is \"not worthy\" or \"not sufficient,\" 「足る」 can be directly negated (e.g., に足りない). However, it is often more natural, especially in more complex sentences, to negate the main predicate that 「に足る」 modifies (e.g., 信頼に足る人物ではない).",
