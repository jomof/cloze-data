        "Usage": "Used to express that something is impossible or hopeless, despite one's efforts or desires. The part after 「どうにも」is typically a verb in its potential negative form, or a noun plus 「にならない」. Often conveys a sense of frustration or resignation."
    },
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「どうにも〜ない」 expresses that something is impossible to do, no matter how hard one tries. It conveys a sense of helplessness or being stuck in a situation. It's often used when expressing frustration or resignation about something that cannot be changed.\n\nThere are primarily three patterns:\n\n*   「どうにも + Vpotential negative」: This pattern indicates that doing something is impossible, such as 「どうにも話せない」 (can’t speak no matter how hard someone tries).\n*   「どうにも + Vます + ようがない」: This pattern suggests that there is no way to do something, like 「どうにも食べようがない」 (there is no way to eat it).\n*   「どうにも + Noun + にならない」: This pattern expresses that something is completely useless or ineffective, such as 「どうにも勉強にならない」 (can’t study at all).",
    "etymology": "「どうにも」 comes from 「どう」 (how) and 「にも」 (even), suggesting that “no matter how” one tries, the result remains the same. 「ない」simply negates the possibility of something happening.",
