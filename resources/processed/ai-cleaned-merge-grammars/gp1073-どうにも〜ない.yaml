        "Register": "Varies depending on the context, ranging from casual to formal.",
        "Usage": "Expresses a sense of helplessness or impossibility.",
        "Components": "Consists of 「どうにも」 (dounimo), meaning \"no matter how,\" followed by a verb in the negative potential form, or phrases like 「ようがない」 (you ga nai), meaning \"there is no way to,\" or 「にならない」 (ni naranai), meaning \"does not amount to/become.\""
    },
    "etymology": "「どうにも」 is derived from 「どう」 (dou), meaning \"how,\" and 「にも」 (nimo), an emphatic particle. Together, they create the sense of \"no matter how\" or \"in any way.\" The addition of 「ない」 (nai) or structures implying impossibility like 「ようがない」 (you ga nai) or 「にならない」 (ni naranai) completes the expression, indicating an absolute inability or lack of means.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「どうにも〜ない」 expresses the idea that something is impossible to do, no matter how hard one tries. It conveys a strong sense of helplessness or being stuck in a situation where no effort or alternative will yield a different result. It can be used in a variety of contexts, from everyday frustrations to more serious or formal settings. The phrase 「どうにも」 emphasizes the lack of options, solutions, or control. It is often used when the speaker feels overwhelmed or utterly unable to change a situation, highlighting a sense of resignation or deep frustration.",
