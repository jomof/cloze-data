        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Used to express resemblance or comparison, often in literary or elevated contexts. It can also describe actions or states that appear to be one way, even if they aren't.",

    "etymology": "「ごとし」 derives from the classical Japanese adjective 「如し (gotoshi)」, meaning \"like\" or \"similar to\". It retains a formal and somewhat archaic feel, often found in literary works or set expressions, reflecting its origins in ancient Japanese literature.",
    "writeup": "「ごとし」 is an auxiliary adjective used to indicate that something resembles or is similar to something else, or that something appears a certain way. It is primarily found in formal, literary, or archaic contexts, often translated as \"like,\" \"as if,\" or \"similar to.\" Unlike its more common counterparts such as 「ようだ」 or 「みたいだ」, 「ごとし」 lends a more elevated and poetic tone to the expression. It is frequently encountered in classical literature, proverbs, and set phrases, lending a sense of timelessness or profound observation. While 「ごとし」 can be used to make simple comparisons, its strength lies in creating vivid imagery or highlighting a striking resemblance, sometimes implying a metaphorical connection. It can also be used to describe actions or states that *appear* to be a certain way, even if they are not truly so, conveying a sense of pretense or strong impression. Due to its formal and literary nature, it is rarely used in casual everyday conversation.",
