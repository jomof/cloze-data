    "etymology": "「ごとし」 derives from the classical Japanese adjective 「如し (gotoshi)」, meaning \"like\" or \"similar to\". It retains a formal and somewhat archaic feel, often found in literary works or set expressions.",
    "writeup": "「ごとし」 is a formal expression used to indicate that something resembles or is similar to something else. It's often translated as \"like,\" \"as if,\" or \"similar to.\" This grammar point is frequently encountered in written Japanese, formal speech, and classical expressions. Its nuance is more literary and less common in everyday conversation, where alternatives like 「ようだ」, 「みたいだ」, or 「かのように」 are preferred. 「ごとし」 is considered more formal than 「よう」 or 「みたい」.",
