    "etymology": "The grammar point is derived from 「物(mono)」 'thing', 「と」 (particle indicating content), and 「思う(omou)」 'to think'. When 「思う」 is in the past tense (「思っていた」), it indicates a past belief or impression.",
    "writeup": "「ものと思っていた」 expresses a past belief or impression that turned out to be different from the actual situation. It combines the noun 「もの」, the particle 「と」, and the verb 「思う」 in the past continuous form (「思っていた」). This grammar point is used to convey that the speaker held a certain belief or expectation in the past, which was later proven to be incorrect or different. It's similar to saying \"I was under the impression that...\" or \"I used to think that...\". It's often followed by a contrasting statement introduced by 「が」 or 「けど」.",
