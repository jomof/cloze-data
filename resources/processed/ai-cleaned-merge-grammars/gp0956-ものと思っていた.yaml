    "etymology": "「物 (mono)」 means 'thing' or 'matter.' 「と」 is a particle indicating a thought or belief. 「思っていた (omotte ita)」 is the past progressive form of 「思う (omou)」, 'to think.' Together, it suggests a state of continuously holding a certain belief or impression.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ものと思っていた」 expresses that the speaker **used to believe** something was true, but it turned out to be different. It conveys a sense of surprise or realization that one's previous assumption was incorrect. A more casual variant is 「もんと思っていた」. The pattern often sets up a contrast, with the first part being the mistaken belief and the second part presenting the actual situation, frequently connected with 「が」 or 「けど」.",
