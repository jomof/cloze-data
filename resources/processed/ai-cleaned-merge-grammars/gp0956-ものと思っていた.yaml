    "etymology": "「物 (mono)」 means 'thing' or 'matter.' 「と」 is a particle indicating a thought or belief. 「思っていた (omotte ita)」 is the past progressive form of 「思う (omou)」, 'to think.' Together, it suggests a state of continuously holding a certain belief or impression.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ものと思っていた」 expresses that the speaker **used to believe** something was true, but it turned out to be different. It conveys a sense of surprise or realization that one's previous assumption was incorrect. This pattern is derived from 「物と思う」, which consists of the noun 「物」 (mono, \"thing\"), the case-marking particle 「と」, and the verb 「思う」 (omou, \"to think\"). Here, 「物」 serves to treat an abstract concept or situation as if it were a concrete, ascertainable fact, making the speaker's past belief sound like a firm, almost objective, impression.\n\nWhen 「思う」 appears in its past progressive form 「思っていた」, the most common translation becomes \"was under the impression that\" or \"as I had believed was true of (A)\". Since 「もの」 functions as a noun, this pattern can follow any word or clause that can modify a noun in its attributive form.\n\nThe use of 「ものと思っていた」 highlights a past impression or belief that has since been contradicted by reality. Consequently, it often appears in sentences where the latter part introduces a contrasting statement, frequently connected by conjunctions like 「が」 (ga) or 「けど」 (kedo). A more casual variant of this expression is 「もんと思っていた」.",
