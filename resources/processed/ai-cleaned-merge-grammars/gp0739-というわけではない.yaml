    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the explanatory 「という」, 「わけ」 (reason/circumstance), the topic marker 「は」, and the negative 「ない」. Literally, it means \"it is not the case that...\" The 「という」 part emphasizes that what follows is a commonly understood or stated reason, which is then being qualified or denied.",
    "writeup": "「というわけではない」 is an emphasized version of 「わけではない」, used to state that something \"doesn't mean that (A)\", \"(A) is not always the case\", or \"it's not that (A)\". 「という」 often introduces (A) as a topic for discussion or an important quotation. It refers back to something said, clarifying that it might not be 100% accurate. It can follow any structure that typically precedes 「という」. A literal translation could be \"it is not so that (A) can be said\". Though not required, 「だ」 is often seen before nouns and な-adjectives before 「というわけではない」.\n\nThis grammar is frequently used to deny that something said earlier is the sole reason for a situation, either correcting a misunderstanding or responding to a listener's request for clarification.\n\nWhen used in the positive form 「という訳だ」, it often concludes statements that are obvious or clear from context, meaning \"so that means (A)\" or \"so the reason is (A)\".",
