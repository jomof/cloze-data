        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "general usage",
        "function": "To indicate that a negative sequence of events has led to an undesirable outcome.",
        "nuance": "Implies a strong sense of exasperation, disappointment, or even blame regarding the final, often regrettable, state of affairs.",

    },
    "etymology": "The word 「始末 (shimatsu)」 itself means 'settlement,' 'circumstances,' or 'handling.' When combined with 「だ」, it forms a grammar point that expresses the culmination of a series of events, typically with a negative connotation. The nuance is that things have reached an undesirable and often regrettable conclusion, as if saying, 'this is the state things have come to' or 'this is how it turned out.'",
    "writeup": "「始末だ」 uses the noun 「始末」, which refers to 'settlement,' 'circumstances,' or 'the end result.' This grammar point is used to indicate a negative sequence of events that has concluded in an equally negative or undesirable outcome. It can be translated as \"to wind up as (A),\" \"to end up as (A),\" or \"to come about that (A).\"\n\nThis expression typically follows verbs in their dictionary (plain) form. The core function of 「始末だ」 is to highlight an unfavorable consequence that has arisen from a particular chain of actions or circumstances. Due to this emphasis on negative outcomes, it frequently appears in sentences alongside other words that convey finality or a cumulative process, such as 「とうとう」 ('finally' or 'at last'), 「挙げ句」 ('after all is said and done' or 'in the end, often implying frustration'), or 「結局」 ('after all' or 'in the end').\n\nWhile the inclusion of these adverbs might seem redundant, they serve to intensify the expression. 「始末だ」 conveys a strong sense of culmination, encompassing the entire progression from beginning to end, leading to the current regrettable state. It is more emphatic than simply stating the negative result, conveying a feeling of exasperation or disappointment that things have come to 'this kind of state.' It suggests that the speaker views the final situation as the unfortunate, inevitable outcome of a preceding chain of events or actions, often implying a degree of blame or regret.",
