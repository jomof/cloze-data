    "etymology": "The word 「始末 (shimatsu)」 itself means 'settlement,' 'circumstances,' or 'handling.' The grammar point uses this meaning to express the culmination of a series of events, typically with a negative connotation. The nuance is that things have reached an undesirable conclusion.",
    "writeup": "「始末だ」, using the noun 「始末」 meaning “settlement” or “end result,” commonly indicates a negative sequence of events leading to a negative outcome. It translates as “to wind up as (A),” “to end up as (A),” or “to come about that (A).” This expression typically follows verbs in their dictionary form.\n\nBecause 「始末」 highlights negative outcomes from a specific event, it often appears with words like 「とうとう」 (“finally”), 「挙げ句」 (“after a long process”), or 「結局」 (“in the end”). While seemingly redundant, 「始末」 emphasizes the culmination from beginning to end, making it more emphatic.",
