    "etymology": "The term 「始末 (shimatsu)」 itself means \"settlement,\" \"circumstances,\" or \"handling.\" When used as 「始末だ」, it implies that the situation has reached a final, often undesirable, state as a result of previous actions or events.",
    "writeup": "「始末 (shimatsu)」, a noun meaning “settlement” or “end result,” is commonly used to indicate a negative sequence of events leading to an equally negative outcome. It translates to “to wind up as (A),” “to end up as (A),” or “to come about that (A).” This expression typically follows verbs in their dictionary form.\n\n「始末だ」 highlights negative outcomes resulting from a specific event, often appearing with words like 「とうとう (toutou)」 “finally,” 「挙げ句 (ageku)」 “after a long process,” or 「結局 (kekkyoku)」 “in the end.” While including these phrases might seem redundant, 「始末」, with its literal translation of “to culminate in” (encompassing everything from beginning to end), provides emphasis rather than redundancy. It conveys a sense of unfortunate culmination.",

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "serious",
            "nuance": "「あんだけ」 is casual slang that emphasizes the amount of times they said to double-check. 「始末だ」 in this context is very blunt.",
            "etymology": "The etymology of 「あんだけ」 is 「あんなに」"

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "melancholic",
            "nuance": "「ドタキャン」 is a very casual expression, 「始末だ」 makes it sound like the speaker is blaming themself even though it was not their fault. ",
            "etymology": "ドタキャン combines 「ドタ」, an onomatopoeia for something happening suddenly, and 「キャンセル (kyanseru)」 from the English word \"cancel\"."

            "setting": "melancholic",
