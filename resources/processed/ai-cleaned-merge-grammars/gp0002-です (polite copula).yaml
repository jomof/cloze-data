jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  function: Serves as a polite copula, stating identity, state, or attributes.
  nuance: Implies politeness and often a degree of certainty or assertion. It is fundamental for polite
    speech.
  grammatical-role: Forms the predicate of a polite sentence.
etymology: 'The copula です (desu) is widely believed to be a contraction and phonetic evolution of であります
  (de arimasu). The original form, であります, combines the particle で (de), which indicates a state or location,
  with the polite verb あります (arimasu), meaning ''to exist''. Over time, であります streamlined into です, becoming
  the ubiquitous polite copula. This linguistic journey explains its core function: politely stating that
  something ''exists as'' or ''is'' a particular noun or adjective, a foundational element in Japanese
  polite speech.'
writeup: |-
  です (desu) is the fundamental polite copula in Japanese, equivalent to 'is,' 'am,' or 'are' in English. It is an essential component of `teineigo` (polite language), making it suitable for most everyday conversations with people you are not intimately familiar with, or in formal settings.

  Its primary function is to express a state of being, identification, or description. It is attached to nouns and `na`-adjectives directly. For `i`-adjectives, です is typically added after the dictionary form to add politeness, although the `i`-adjective can stand alone in polite contexts without です. Verbs do not use です; instead, they use the `ます` (masu) form to achieve politeness.

  です does not inherently carry tense; its tense is determined by context or by changing to its past form, でした (deshita). It is a highly versatile and frequently used word, crucial for forming polite sentences and interacting appropriately in Japanese society. It is used by speakers of all genders and ages when politeness is desired.
false_friends:
  - term: だ (casual copula)
    meaning: casual form of 'to be'
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both だ and です function as copulas, だ is used in casual and informal contexts among friends
      or family, whereas です is used in polite contexts. 「学生だ」 (Gakusei da) is 'I am a student' (casual),
      while 「学生です」 (Gakusei desu) is 'I am a student' (polite).
    grammar_point: だ (casual copula)
  - term: である (formal present)
    meaning: formal/literary form of 'to be'
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: である is a very formal and literary copula, commonly found in written Japanese, academic papers,
      news reports, or formal speeches. It is rarely used in spoken everyday conversation. です is the standard
      polite copula for general spoken communication.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:である (formal present)
  - term: ございます (polite copula, formal)
    meaning: highly polite form of 'to be'
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ございます is an even more polite and humble form of です, often used in business settings, customer
      service, or situations requiring extreme deference. です is generally sufficient for polite everyday
      interaction, while ございます indicates a higher level of respect.
    grammar_point: でございます (polite copula, formal)
  - term: ます (polite non-past verb ending)
    meaning: polite ending for verbs
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: ます is used for verbs to make them polite, for example, 食べます (tabemasu, 'eat'). です is used
      for nouns and adjectives. Students often confuse them; remember, you wouldn't say 「食べです」 for 'I
      eat politely,' nor would you say 「学生ます」 for 'I am a student.'
    grammar_point: Verb[ます] (polite present)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the differences between です and similar expressions is key to
  speaking natural and appropriate Japanese. です is your go-to for general politeness with nouns and adjectives.
  だ is for casual speech. である is for very formal written or spoken contexts. ございます elevates politeness
  to a humble or business level. Finally, remember that verbs use ます, not です, to achieve politeness.

post_example_writeup: The examples provided demonstrate the versatility of です across various contexts,
  from self-introductions to descriptions of objects and qualities. Notice how です always attaches to the
  end of nouns or adjectives to form a polite statement. While `i`-adjectives can stand alone to convey
  politeness, adding です often softens the expression or adds a slight emphasis on the statement's politeness,
  as seen in examples like 「天気 が いい です」 or 「難しい です」。Mastering です is a cornerstone of polite Japanese communication.
