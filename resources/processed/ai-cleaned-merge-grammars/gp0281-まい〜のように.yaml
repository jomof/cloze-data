        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "General use",
        "function": "Expresses high frequency or near-regularity of an action or event.",
        "nuance": "Softens the absoluteness of 'every', implying something occurs so regularly it's as if it happens every single time, or very nearly so. Can suggest either slight exaggeration or close approximation."
    },
    "etymology": "「まい」 (mai) originates from the kanji 毎, meaning 'every'. 「のように」 (no yō ni) functions as 'like' or 'in the manner of'. Therefore, 「まい〜のように」 literally conveys 'in the manner of every', signifying a behavior or occurrence that closely approximates happening every single time.",
    "writeup": "まい〜のように (mai no yō ni) indicates that something happens with a high degree of frequency, often translated as \"almost every ~\", \"nearly every ~\", or \"on a ~ basis\". The phrase combines 毎 (mai), meaning \"every\", with のように (no yō ni), which means \"like\" or \"in the manner of\". Thus, the literal interpretation is \"in the manner of every [time period]\".\n\nThis grammar point is used with words expressing measurements, typically time periods, such as 毎日 (mainichi - every day), 毎週 (maishuu - every week), or 毎年 (maitoshi - every year). While 毎 itself means \"every\", the addition of のように softens the absoluteness, implying that something occurs so regularly it's **as if** it happens every single time, or very nearly so. It can express either a slight exaggeration or a close approximation.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\nUnlike general usage where みたいに (mitaini) and のように (no yō ni) are often interchangeable, this does not apply to まい〜のように. The phrase みたいだ (mitaida) is an abbreviation of the more formal を見たような (wo mita youna), which implies seeing or perceiving something. Therefore, using みたいに with time measurements or abstract concepts that cannot be \"seen\" can sound unnatural. まい〜のように specifically uses のように because it refers to the **manner** in which something occurs, even if that manner is abstract.",

            "nuance": "「たびに」 refers to something happening *every single time* a specific event occurs, indicating a direct correlation between the event and the consequence. 「まい〜のように」 focuses on general, high frequency over a period, not necessarily tied to a specific trigger event."
