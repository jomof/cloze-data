    "writeup": "「まい〜のように」 indicates that something happens \"almost every\" or \"nearly every\" specified time period. 「まい」 means \"every,\" derived from the kanji 毎, and is always followed by a word expressing a measurement, typically of time. This grammar point is similar to 「のように」, but the interchangeable usage of 「みたいに」 and 「のように」 does not apply here. Using 「みたいに」 in place of 「ように」 sounds unnatural as it describes things that cannot be seen, like time.",
