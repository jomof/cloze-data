pronunciation:
  katakana: ダッテ

    counter-argument.
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: conjunction
  register: casual
  usage-context: Primarily used in informal conversations when expressing a defensive stance, making an
    excuse, or dismissing a previous statement.
  function: Provides a reason or counter-argument.
  nuance: Carries connotations of defense, exasperation, dismissal, or defiance.
etymology: The particle だって originates from the combination of だ (the copula) and とて (an archaic conjunctive
  particle meaning 'even if' or 'even though'). This historical connection to 'even' explains its versatility,
  though this specific grammar point focuses on its 'because' and 'but' functions. It also connects to
  its use in casual quotation, as と is a quotation particle.
writeup: 'だって is a versatile and highly conversational expression in Japanese, primarily serving two main
  functions within this grammar point: providing a reason or justification, and introducing a counter-argument
  or contradiction. It''s almost exclusively used in informal settings, such as talking with friends,
  family, or close acquaintances. When used to give a reason, だって often carries a nuance of defense, exasperation,
  or a slight complaint. It''s like saying ''But, because...'' or ''I mean, it''s because...''. It implies
  that the reason being given is obvious or that the speaker feels misunderstood. For example, if someone
  asks why you''re late, you might say 「だって、電車が遅れたんだもん！」 (''But, the train was delayed!'') or 「だって、時間がなかったんだから！」
  (''But, I didn''t have time!''), expressing a hint of frustration. As a counter-argument or contradiction,
  だって serves to dismiss or strongly oppose a previous statement. It''s similar to ''But no!'' or ''That''s
  not true!''. This usage also conveys a strong, often emotional, response, indicating disagreement or
  rejection of the premise.'
false_friends:
  - term: から (reason cause)
    meaning: Because; so; from
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: から is a neutral particle used to state a reason or cause. だって, however, is much more informal
      and often implies a defensive or exasperated tone when giving a reason.
    grammar_point: から・ので (reason・cause)
  - term: ので (reason)
    meaning: Because; since
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ので states a reason or cause in a more objective or polite manner than から. だって is always informal
      and carries an emotional undertone of justification or complaint, unlike ので.
    grammar_point: から・ので (reason・cause)
  - term: もの・もん (because・since)
    meaning: Because; since (informal, often with softer or childish nuance)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: もの・もん also provides an informal reason or excuse, but tends to be softer, more personal, or
      sometimes childish. だって can be more assertive, defiant, or dismissive in its presentation of a reason
      or counter-argument.
    grammar_point: もの・もん (because・since)
  - term: んです・のです (explanatory emphatic)
    meaning: Used to provide explanations, seek further information, or express emphasis.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: んです・のです provides a general explanation or context for a situation. While だって also provides
      a reason, it specifically introduces a reason with a defensive, dismissive, or exasperated tone,
      often as a direct response to a question or accusation.
    grammar_point: 〜のだ・〜んだ (explanatory)
  - term: けれども (but・although)
    meaning: But; although; however
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: けれども is a neutral and general conjunction for 'but'. だって, when used to mean 'but', introduces
      a strong, often emotional, counter-argument or rejection of a previous statement, implying defiance
      or dismissal.
    grammar_point: が・けど (but・however, contrast)
  - term: でも (even・any・no matter)
    meaning: Even; or something; any (with question words); no matter (who/what/where/when)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While でも can introduce a concession or 'even so' idea, だって in its 'but' usage is a direct,
      often emotional, contradiction or dismissal of a previous statement in informal speech.
    grammar_point: でも (even・any・no matter)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing だって from other reason-giving expressions like から, ので,
  and もの・もん, remember that だって almost always injects a personal, often emotional, layer of defense or
  exasperation. It's not just stating a fact; it's presenting it with a particular attitude. Similarly,
  when だって acts like 'but', unlike neutral connectors such as けれども, it serves as a more direct and often
  defiant rebuttal.
examples:
  - english: But, because I didn't have time!
    japanese:
      - '{だ って}、時間 が なかっ た ん だ もん！'
      - '{だ って}、時間 が なかっ た ん です よ！'
    english_literally: But, time didn't exist!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 時間 が なかっ た から。
        english: Because I didn't have time.
        hint: 「から」 simply states a reason; 「だって」 adds a defensive or exasperated tone. We're looking for
          that nuanced excuse.
    scene: A student is explaining to their friend why they couldn't finish their homework.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The use of 「だって」 indicates a defensive and slightly exasperated tone, typical when giving
      an excuse to a close friend. The 「んだもん」 ending further softens the excuse, making it sound more
      personal and a bit like a complaint.
  - english: But it's cold!
    japanese:
      - '{だ って} 寒い ん だ から。'
      - '{だ って} 寒い から ね。'
    english_literally: But, because it is cold.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 寒い から ね。
        english: Because it's cold.
        hint: This just states a reason. We're looking for an excuse that implies a strong feeling or
          defense.
    scene: A child is refusing to go outside to play because of the weather.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The phrase 「だって寒いんだから」 is a common, slightly whiny or defensive way for a child to give a
      reason for not wanting to do something. 「だもん」 or 「だから」 often accompany だって in these contexts.
  - english: No, but that's not what I meant!
    japanese:
      - いや、{だ って}、そう じゃ ない って！
      - いや、{だ って}、そう じゃ ない！
    english_literally: No, but, it's not like that!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - いや、で も、そう じゃ ない！
        english: No, but that's not it!
        hint: 「でも」 is a general 'but'. 「だって」 in this context implies a stronger, more emotional contradiction.
    scene: Someone is trying to correct a misunderstanding in an argument with a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: Here, 「だって」 introduces a strong counter-argument, often used when feeling frustrated or misunderstood.
      The repetition of 「って」 at the end of the sentence adds emphasis to the denial.
  - english: But, I didn't say anything like that!
    japanese:
      - '{だ って}、そんな こと 言っ て ない！'
      - '{だ って}、そんな こと 言っ て ない もん！'
    english_literally: But, didn't say such a thing!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - そんな こと 言っ て ない！
        english: I didn't say anything like that!
        hint: This is a denial. 「だって」 adds a defensive or indignant tone to the denial.
    scene: Someone is denying an accusation made by another person.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: This example uses 「だって」 to introduce a direct and strong denial, often in a defensive tone,
      contradicting what was just said or implied by the listener.
  - english: She's always like that, you know. Because she's clumsy.
    japanese:
      - あの 子、いつ も そう だ よ。{だ って}、不 器用 な ん だ もん。
      - あの 子、いつ も そう だ よ。{だ って}、不 器用 な の よ。
    english_literally: That child, always like that. Because, is clumsy.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 子、いつ も そう だ よ。不 器用 だ から。
        english: She's always like that. Because she's clumsy.
        hint: 「から」 is a neutral reason. 「だって」 here offers an empathetic, slightly excusing reason.
    scene: Two friends are gossiping about a mutual acquaintance's habit of making mistakes.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「だって」 here provides a casual, almost sympathetic, explanation for someone's behavior. The
      「なんだもん」 again adds a personal, slightly excusing tone, implying the clumsiness is an inherent trait.
  - english: But you said it was okay!
    japanese:
      - '{だ って}、いい って 言っ た じゃん！'
      - '{だ って}、いい って 言っ た じゃん か！'
      - '{だ って}、いい って 言っ た でしょ！'
    english_literally: But, said it's okay!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - で も、いい って 言っ た じゃん！
        english: But, you said it was okay!
        hint: 「でも」 is a general 'but'. 「だって」 emphasizes the betrayal of a previous statement more strongly.
    scene: A teenager is arguing with a parent who is scolding them for something they had previously
      allowed.
    register: casual
    setting: condescending
    nuance: This shows 「だって」 used to confront someone with their own prior statement, implying a betrayal
      or inconsistency. 「じゃん」 is a very casual, often confrontational, sentence-ending particle. The setting
      is changed to 'condescending' to better reflect the child's likely tone towards a parent in this
      type of argument.
  - english: We can't go to the park, because it's raining.
    japanese:
      - 公園 に は 行け ない よ。{だ って}、雨 降っ てる から。
      - 公園 に は 行け ない よ。{だ って}、雨 が 降っ て いる から。
    english_literally: Cannot go to the park. Because, rain is falling.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 公園 に は 行け ない よ。雨 降っ てる から。
        english: We can't go to the park, because it's raining.
        hint: Both state a reason, but 「だって」 emphasizes the reason as an unavoidable constraint, often
          with a hint of lament.
    scene: A parent is explaining to a child why they can't go out to play.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「だって」 here serves as a simple, direct explanation, used in a way a parent might use to explain
      a situation to a child. It's less defensive and more factual, but still maintains its informal nature.
  - english: But I already told you, I'm busy!
    japanese:
      - '{だ って}、忙しい って 言っ た でしょ！'
      - '{だ って}、もう 忙しい って 言っ た でしょ！'
    english_literally: But, said busy, right!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - で も、もう 忙しい って 言っ た でしょ！
        english: But, I already told you, I'm busy!
        hint: 「でも」 is a milder 'but'. 「だって」 conveys a stronger sense of frustration and reiteration.
    scene: Someone is feeling annoyed because they are being repeatedly asked to do something despite
      having already refused.
    register: casual
    setting: excited
    nuance: 「だって」 here expresses exasperation and reiterates a previously stated reason, reinforcing the
      speaker's position in a slightly impatient tone. 「でしょ」 seeks confirmation, adding to the frustrated
      feeling. The setting 'excited' better reflects a state of exasperation in an informal context.
  - english: Why didn't you come to the party? Well, I mean, I was tired!
    japanese:
      - な ん で パーティー に 来 なかっ た の？{だ って}、眠かっ た ん だ もん。
      - な ん で パーティー に 来 なかっ た の？{だ って}、眠かっ た から ね。
    english_literally: Why didn't you come to the party? Because, I was sleepy.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 眠かっ た から。
        english: Because I was sleepy.
        hint: 「から」 is a simple reason. 「だって」 introduces the reason as an excuse, often with a slightly
          whiny or defensive tone.
    scene: A friend asks why another friend missed a party, and they give a somewhat flimsy excuse.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The combination of 「だって」 and 「んだもん」 creates a nuance of a casual, slightly whiny, or childish
      excuse for an action. The speaker avoids a direct or strong confrontation, opting for a softer justification.
  - english: But, I cleaned it!
    japanese:
      - '{だ って}、掃除 し た よ！'
      - '{だ って}、掃除 し た もん！'
      - '{だ って}、掃除 し まし た よ！'
    english_literally: But, I cleaned!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - で も、掃除 し た よ！
        english: But, I cleaned it!
        hint: 「でも」 is a simple 'but'. 「だって」 adds a strong defensive and slightly indignant nuance to the
          counter-statement.
    scene: Someone is defending themselves against an accusation that they didn't clean.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: Here, 「だって」 introduces a direct and slightly defiant counter-statement, often used when responding
      to a complaint or accusation, asserting a fact that contradicts the listener's premise. The setting
      is 'serious' because it's a direct defense of one's actions.
