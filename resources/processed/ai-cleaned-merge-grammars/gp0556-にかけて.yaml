    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にかけて」 comes from the verb 「掛ける (kakeru)」, which means \"to hang,\" \"to suspend,\" or \"to extend.\" The 「に」 indicates a direction or starting point, so literally, it suggests something extends 'towards' or 'over' a certain period or area.",
    "writeup": "「にかけて」は、特定の期間や範囲にわたって何かが起こることを示します。「に」は方向や起点を示し、「掛ける」は「懸ける」や「跨る」といった意味合いを持ち、物事がその範囲に及ぶ、あるいは進行中であることを表します。この表現は主に名詞と共に用いられ、時間的な連続性や地理的な広がりを示す際に使用されます。特に、ニュースなどでは気象現象が一定期間続くことを示す際によく見られます。文章語での使用が多いですが、会話でも自然に用いられる表現です。",
