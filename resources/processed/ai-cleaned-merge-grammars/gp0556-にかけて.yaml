    "etymology": "This grammar point comes from the verb 掛(か)ける (kakeru), meaning \"to hang\" or \"to suspend.\" The に (ni) particle marks a location or time, and the て (te) form connects the verb to the ongoing action. Thus, it evokes the image of something being \"suspended\" or ongoing within a specific timeframe or range.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point にかけて conveys that something happens over a period of time, from one point until another, or throughout a specific duration or range. It originates from the verb 掛(か)ける \"to hang, to suspend\". The construction is に (marking location/time) + 掛(か)けて (suspended in an ongoing process). It's often used with nouns to specify time or location. It appears frequently in written language, including news reports describing weather patterns. When the adverbial particle は is added after にかけて, it transforms the meaning to something like \"limited to within (A)\" implying a contrast. Therefore '(A) は (B)' means that 'only (A) defines (A), (B) is a separate entity/discussion'.",
