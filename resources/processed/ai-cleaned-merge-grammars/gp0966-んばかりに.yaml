    "etymology": "This grammar point combines 「ん」, an abbreviation of 「む」 (a classical auxiliary verb expressing intent or strong will, similar to 「う」 and 「よう」), with the adverbial particle 「ばかり」, meaning 'basically exactly as described.' Thus, 「んばかり」 implies the volitional form of a verb appearing to be on the verge of happening.",
    "writeup": "「んばかりに」 is used to describe a situation where something is done \"as if it were (A),\" or \"seeming that it will (A).\" It's considered a formal expression. It's formed by attaching 「んばかりに」 to the ない-stem (indeterminate form) of a verb, followed by a statement modified by 「に」. When modifying a noun, 「に」 is replaced with 「の」.\n\nLinguists debate whether 「ん」 is an abbreviation of 「む」 (classical 「う」/「よう」) or 「ぬ」 (classical 「ない」). Due to the uncertainty, it's advisable to choose the interpretation that best helps you remember the nuance of the grammar point.",
