    "etymology": "The grammar point 「んばかりに」 is thought to be a combination of 「ん」, an abbreviation of 「む」 (the classical auxiliary verb used to show intent or strong will, similar to 「う」 and 「よう」), and the adverbial particle 「ばかり」, indicating something is 'basically exactly as described'. Thus, 「んばかり」 suggests the volitional form of a verb is about to happen.",
    "writeup": "「んばかりに」 is used to express that something is being done \"as if it were (A)\" or \"seeming that it will (A).\" It combines 「ん」 (an abbreviation of 「む」, a classical auxiliary verb showing intent, similar to 「う」 or 「よう」) with the adverbial particle 「ばかり」, indicating \"basically exactly as described.\" Therefore, 「んばかり」 suggests the volitional form of (A) is about to happen. It typically attaches to the ない-stem of verbs. It is generally used in formal writing and speech.",
