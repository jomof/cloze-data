meaning: polite past tense of verbs
pronunciation:
  katakana: シマシタ
  romaji: shimashita
formation:
  Verb[ます stem] + ました: The polite past tense form for verbs.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The `ました` ending is a combination of the auxiliary verb `ます` and the past tense auxiliary `た`.
  The auxiliary `ます` originally had meanings related to 'increase' or 'perform', and over time, it grammaticalized
  to indicate politeness. The addition of `た` simply marks the action as having occurred in the past,
  resulting in the polite past form used widely today.
writeup: The `ました` form is the polite past tense of Japanese verbs. It is used to describe actions that
  have been completed in the past, and it carries a polite nuance, making it suitable for most everyday
  conversations and formal settings where politeness is appropriate. To form it, you take the `ます` stem
  of a verb (which is typically the dictionary form minus the final る, う, く, ぐ, す, etc., and adding い
  for Ichidan verbs, or the `ます` form minus `ます`), and then append `ました`. For example, `食べます` (to eat,
  polite present) becomes `食べました` (ate, polite past), and `行きます` (to go, polite present) becomes `行きました`
  (went, polite past). This form is fundamental for expressing past actions respectfully in Japanese,
  complementing the polite present tense `ます`. While `ました` indicates a completed action, it does not necessarily
  imply a single, instantaneous event; it can also describe an action that was completed over a period
  of time, as long as the entire action is viewed as finished. Understanding `ました` is crucial as it forms
  one of the pillars of polite Japanese speech.

  - term: Verb[た] (past tense)
    meaning: plain past tense of verbs
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While `Verb[た]` also expresses past completed actions, it is the plain or casual form. `Verb[ました]`
      is used in polite contexts, whereas `Verb[た]` is typically used with close friends, family, or in
      informal writing. The core meaning of a past completed action is the same, but the social register
      is different.
    grammar_point: Verb[た] (past tense)
  - term: Verb[ませんでした] (polite past negative)
    meaning: polite past negative tense of verbs
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`Verb[ませんでした]` indicates that an action was *not* performed in the past, in a polite manner.
      It is the negative counterpart to `Verb[ました]`, so while related in politeness and tense, their meaning
      is opposite.'
    grammar_point: Verb[ませんでした] (polite past negative)
  - term: Verb[ていた] (past progressive・resultative)
    meaning: was doing / had done (state)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`Verb[ていた]` describes an action that was ongoing in the past (e.g., ''was eating'') or a
      state that resulted from a past action and continued (e.g., ''was married''). In contrast, `Verb[ました]`
      simply states that an action was completed at some point in the past.'
    grammar_point: Verb[ていた] (past progressive・resultative)
  - term: Verb[た]ことがある (experience of having done)
    meaning: have done (experience)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`Verb[た]ことがある` specifically means ''have had the experience of doing something.'' It focuses
      on the existence of a past experience, often implying a recurrent or significant event. `Verb[ました]`
      simply reports a past action without this emphasis on accumulated experience.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[た]ことがある (experience of having done)
  - term: でした (past copula, polite)
    meaning: was / were (polite)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: '`でした` is the polite past form of the copula `です` and is used with nouns and adjectives to
      describe past states or identities (e.g., `学生でした` - ''was a student''; `元気でした` - ''was healthy'').
      `Verb[ました]` is exclusively used with verbs to describe past actions. The confusion arises because
      both end in `ました`, but their grammatical functions are distinct.'
    grammar_point: でした (past copula, polite)
post_false_friends_writeup: When using the polite past tense, it's essential to consider the nuance of
  other past-related forms. While `〜ました` simply states a completed past action, `〜た` conveys the same
  meaning but in a casual tone. For negative statements in the polite past, use `〜ませんでした`. If you are
  talking about an action that was ongoing in the past, or a state that continued from a past action,
  `〜ていた` is the appropriate form. Finally, for expressing the experience of having done something, `〜たことがある`
  is used. Remember that `でした` is for nouns and adjectives, not verbs. Paying attention to these distinctions
  will greatly improve the naturalness and accuracy of your Japanese.

post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how `Verb[ました]` functions to convey completed past actions
  in various polite contexts, from casual conversations with acquaintances to more formal or respectful
  interactions. Notice how it seamlessly integrates with different types of verbs and sentence structures
  to describe what happened. The choice between `〜ました` and its plain form `〜た` largely depends on the
  social context and the relationship between the speakers, emphasizing the importance of register in
  Japanese communication.
