    "etymology": "The term 以上 (ijō) consists of two kanji: 以 (i), meaning \"by means of\" or \"because of,\" and 上 (jō), meaning \"above\" or \"on top.\" The addition of に (ni) turns it into an adverbial phrase, indicating a state or condition that exceeds a certain point. Thus, 以上に literally conveys the sense of \"beyond what is above,\" or simply, \"more than.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「以上に」 is used to express that something is \"more than,\" \"no less than,\" or \"even more\" than a certain extent or expectation. It indicates that something exceeds a specific limit or goes beyond a certain level. This structure often appears after nouns, verbs, い-adjectives, or な-adjectives. In some cases, 「に」 can be replaced by 「の」 when emphasizing a specific amount or quantity measured in relation to something else.",
