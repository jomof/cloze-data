    "etymology": "This pattern combines 「なら」 (if) with 「で」, which acts as a conjunction, emphasizing the condition and expectation of the repeated action.",
    "writeup": "The 「なら〜で」 pattern is used when the same word is repeated twice, expressing the speaker's opinion or dissatisfaction. It conveys the idea that if something is going to be done, it should be done properly, or that something should have been done sooner. This pattern often carries a nuance of dissatisfaction or mild annoyance.\n\nIt can follow verbs in their plain form, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns. Both 「なら」 and 「で」 function as conjunction particles in this grammar pattern.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The repeated word emphasizes the action or state.\n*   The sentence often implies a criticism or suggestion.",
