    "etymology": "This pattern combines 「なら」 (if) with 「で」, which acts as a conjunction, emphasizing the condition and expectation of the repeated action.",
    "writeup": "The 「なら〜で」 pattern is a structure where the same word is repeated twice, followed by some sort of opinion regarding that action or state. It can be translated as 'if (A), you should (B)', or 'before (A), you should (B)'. In many cases, it is used to express the speaker's dissatisfaction about something.\n\nThis pattern can follow verbs in their plain forms, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns. Both 「なら」 and 「で」 function as conjunction particles in this grammar pattern.\n\nIt is important to note that this nuance differs from other conditional structures like ば〜で, たら〜たで, and even another specific application of なら〜で itself. These other patterns are used when conveying that something either is or is not an issue in relation to the conditional (A). For instance, the latter なら〜で (without word repetition) typically appears following な-adjectives.",
