    "etymology": "This pattern combines 「なら」 (if) with 「で」, which acts as a conjunction, emphasizing the condition and expectation of the repeated action. The repetition of the word serves to intensify the conditional aspect, suggesting that if the action or state is truly the case, then a certain consequence or expectation follows.",
    "writeup": "The 「なら〜で」 pattern is a structure where the same word is repeated twice, followed by some sort of opinion regarding that action or state. It can be translated as 'if (A), you should (B)', or 'before (A), you should (B)'. In many cases, it is used to express the speaker's dissatisfaction about something.\n\nThis pattern can follow verbs in their plain forms, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns. Both 「なら」 and 「で」 function as conjunction particles in this grammar pattern.\n\nIt is important to note that this nuance differs from other conditional structures like ば〜で, たら〜たで, and even another specific application of なら〜で itself. These other patterns are used when conveying that something either is or is not an issue in relation to the conditional (A). For instance, the latter なら〜で (without word repetition) typically appears following な-adjectives. The repetition in 「なら〜で」 emphasizes a strong expectation or mild exasperation, indicating that if the initial condition is true, then a certain action or outcome is expected or demanded.",
