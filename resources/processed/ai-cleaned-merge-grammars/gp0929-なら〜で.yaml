    "etymology": "The structure combines 「なら」 (if) with 「で」, a conjunction particle. The repetition emphasizes the condition and expresses a sense of what should be done given that condition.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「なら〜で」 expresses that if something is going to be done, it should be done properly, or that it should have been done sooner. It often carries a nuance of dissatisfaction or annoyance on the part of the speaker. The structure requires repeating the same word twice, connected by 「なら」 and 「で」. It can be used with verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns. When used with nouns and na-adjectives, 「だ」 is usually required to connect it to the 「なら」.",
