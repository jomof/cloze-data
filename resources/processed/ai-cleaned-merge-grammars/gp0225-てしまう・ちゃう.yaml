        "Verb[て-form] + ちゃう": "Casual contraction of てしまう, same meaning."
    },
    "etymology": "The verb 「しまう」(仕舞う or 終う) originally means \"to put away,\" \"to finish,\" or \"to close.\" When attached to the te-form of another verb, it carries nuances of concluding an action, often with implications of finality, regret, or unintentionality. The contraction 「ちゃう」 is a common colloquial shortening of 「てしまう」.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「てしまう」, and its more casual contraction 「ちゃう」, are auxiliary verbs attached to the te-form of other verbs. They primarily convey three nuances: completion, regret, or unintentional action.\n\n*   **Completion:** Indicates that an action has been completely finished. Think of this as \"doing something to the end.\" For example, 「全部食べてしまった」 means \"I ate it all up.\"\n*   **Regret:** Expresses a sense of regret or disappointment about something that has happened. It suggests that the speaker wishes they could undo the action. For example, 「傘を忘れてしまった」 means \"I unfortunately forgot my umbrella.\"\n*   **Unintentional Action:** Describes an action that was done unintentionally or accidentally. For example, 「舌を噛んでしまった」 means \"I accidentally bit my tongue.\"\n\nThe form 「ちゃう」 is a shortened, more casual version of 「てしまう」 and is frequently used in spoken Japanese. Be mindful of the context to discern the specific nuance being conveyed.",
