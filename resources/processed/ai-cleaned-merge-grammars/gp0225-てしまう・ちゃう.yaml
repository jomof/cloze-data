    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てしまう」 is composed of the verb 「て」 form, which connects actions, and 「しまう」, originally meaning \"to put away\" or \"to finish.\" Over time, 「しまう」 evolved to express the nuances of completion, regret, or doing something unintentionally. While 「て終う」 (て おう) is most frequently written in hiragana, 「て仕舞う」 (て しまう) may also be seen. There is a slight nuance difference between these two kanji structures: 「終う」 suggests a permanent or definitive ending, while 「仕舞う」 implies putting something away or finishing a process, which could be temporary. The primary meaning of 「しまう」 always conveys that \"something has come to the point where ending/ending up in a specific state cannot be avoided.\"",
    "writeup": "By combining the particle **te** (て) with the verb 「しまう」, you can express that something was done \"by accident,\" \"completely,\" or \"unfortunately.\" These meanings may seem different, but they share similarities. Let's examine examples of 「てしまう」. Verbs that usually take 「で」 instead of 「て」 will behave the same way with 「てしまう」. Sometimes, 「てしまう」 or 「でしまう」 is shortened to a more casual form, often used in speech. 「てしまう」 becomes 「ちゃう」 and 「でしまう」 becomes 「じゃう」.\n\nDue to this \"cannot be avoided\" nuance, 「しまう」 often comes across as \"totally,\" as in \"Ah… I totally left the chicken in the oven for too long.\" It expresses the speaker's exasperation that something is \"too late\" to change. However, despite being used negatively, 「てしまう」 can also be used positively, maintaining the nuance of \"no turning back.\"\n\nIt is important to note that certain conjugations, such as the imperative forms (e.g., 「てしまえ」, 「ちゃえ」), are considered unnatural or very rare in everyday conversation.",
