        "usage-context": "General"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てしまう」 is composed of the verb 「て」 form, which connects actions, and 「しまう」. The original meaning of 「しまう」 was \"to put away\" or \"to finish.\" Over time, 「しまう」 evolved to express the nuances of completion, regret, or doing something unintentionally. While 「て終う」 (て おう) is most frequently written in hiragana, 「て仕舞う」 (て しまう) may also be seen. There is a slight nuance difference between these two kanji structures: 「終う」 suggests a permanent or definitive ending, such as completing a task, while 「仕舞う」 implies putting something away or finishing a process, which could be temporary, like closing a shop for the day. The primary meaning of 「しまう」 in this grammatical construction always conveys that \"something has come to the point where ending or ending up in a specific state cannot be avoided.\"",
    "writeup": "By combining the **te** (て) form of a verb with the auxiliary verb 「しまう」, one can express that an action was done \"completely,\" \"by accident,\" or \"unfortunately.\" These meanings may seem distinct, but they all share the nuance of finality or an irreversible outcome. Let's look at examples of 「てしまう」. Even verbs that typically take 「で」 to form their te-form will combine with 「しまう」 in the same manner. Sometimes, 「てしまう」 or 「でしまう」 is shortened to a more casual form, frequently used in spoken language. 「てしまう」 becomes 「ちゃう」, and 「でしまう」 becomes 「じゃう」.\n\nDue to this \"cannot be avoided\" nuance, 「しまう」 often conveys a sense of \"totally,\" as in \"Ah… I totally left the chicken in the oven for too long.\" This usage expresses the speaker's exasperation that something is \"too late\" to change. However, despite often being used in negative contexts, 「てしまう」 can also be used positively, maintaining the nuance of an unchangeable completion. For instance, 「宿題 を 終わらせて しまおう」 (Let's get the homework totally finished!) implies a definitive completion.\n\nIt is important to note that certain conjugations, such as the imperative forms (e.g., 「てしまえ」, 「ちゃえ」), are very rare in everyday conversation and can sound quite forceful or unnatural.",
