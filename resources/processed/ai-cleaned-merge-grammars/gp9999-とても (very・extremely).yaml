etymology: The adverb 「とても」 originates from a combination of the old particle 「とて」 (which indicated cause,
  reason, or condition, similar to 'even if' or 'no matter how') and the inclusive particle 「も」. This
  etymology is particularly evident in its usage with negative forms, such as 「とてもできない」, which literally
  conveys 'even if (I try), I cannot do it,' thereby signifying 'it is utterly impossible.' Over time,
  its meaning broadened to a general intensifier for positive statements, indicating 'very' or 'extremely,'
  dropping the conditional nuance from its positive use but retaining the strong emphasis. This evolution
  from a conditional/concessive particle to an intensifier highlights its versatility in expressing high
  degree or absolute impossibility.
writeup: |-
  「とても」 is a highly versatile and common Japanese adverb used primarily to intensify the meaning of adjectives, verbs, and other adverbs. It translates to "very," "extremely," or "terribly" in English. When used with positive statements, it simply emphasizes a high degree of a quality or action. For example, saying 「とても美味しい」 means "(It's) very delicious," indicating a strong positive impression.

  Its usage extends to modifying な-adjectives (e.g., 「とても静か」 - "very quiet") and verbs (e.g., 「とても疲れた」 - "very tired"). 「とても」 can be used across various registers, from casual to polite, making it a fundamental word in everyday conversation.

  A crucial aspect of 「とても」 is its interaction with negative forms. When paired with a negative verb or adjective, it expresses a strong sense of impossibility or extreme difficulty, often translating to "cannot possibly" or "not at all." For instance, 「とてもできない」 means "(I) absolutely cannot do it," or "(It's) utterly impossible." This nuanced usage stemming from its etymological roots is important to grasp for accurate comprehension and natural expression. The implied meaning is 'no matter how much I try, it's not possible.'

  - term: すごく
    meaning: Very; amazingly
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「すごく」 is generally more casual and often implies a sense of surprise or strong emotional reaction
      from the speaker. While 「とても」 is also strong, 「すごく」 can convey a more personal, subjective feeling.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:すごく (very)
  - term: 大変
    meaning: Very; serious; difficult
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「大変」 can mean 'very' (e.g., 「大変嬉しい」 - 'very happy'), it often carries an additional
      connotation of 'difficulty,' 'seriousness,' or 'trouble.' It's generally more formal than 「とても」
      when used as an intensifier.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:大変 (very・difficult)
  - term: 非常に
    meaning: Extremely; remarkably
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「非常に」 is a more formal and objective intensifier than 「とても」. It's often used in written language
      or formal speeches and lacks the more colloquial feel that 「とても」 can sometimes have.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:非常に (extremely)
  - term: あまり〜ない
    meaning: Not very; not much
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「あまり〜ない」 indicates 'not very' or 'not much,' suggesting a low degree or partial negation.
      In contrast, 「とても〜ない」 expresses a complete or extreme impossibility/difficulty. For example, 「あまり美味しくない」
      (not very delicious) vs. 「とても美味しくない」 (terribly not delicious, often implying impossible to eat).
    grammar_point: あまり ない (not very or much)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between 「とても」 and other intensifiers like 「すごく」, 「大変」, or 「非常に」,
  consider the level of formality and the nuance of your emotion. 「すごく」 is suitable for casual, emotional
  emphasis. 「大変」 is used for situations requiring a strong emphasis due to difficulty or seriousness.
  「非常に」 is reserved for formal and objective contexts. For negations, remember that 「とても〜ない」 conveys absolute
  impossibility or extreme difficulty, a much stronger sentiment than the partial negation implied by
  「あまり〜ない」.
