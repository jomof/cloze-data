details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: teineigo (polite)
  particle-syntactic-function: sentence-final
  particle-pragmatic-function: interrogative
  usage-context: Commonly used in both formal and casual speech to form questions or express uncertainty.
  function: Transforms a statement into an interrogative clause or indicates speaker's doubt.
  nuance: When used at the end of a sentence, it functions similarly to a question mark. It can also mark
    embedded questions or express uncertainty within a sentence. In casual speech, omitting です/ます before
    か implies familiarity.
  counterpoint: In casual speech, a rising intonation can also convey a question without か, though か provides
    explicit grammatical marking.
  colocation: Frequently follows verb/adjective plain forms or です/ます forms. Often seen with どうか (whether
    or not).
  grammatical-role: Sentence-ending particle, or an internal particle forming embedded questions.
  logical-flow: Changes a declarative statement into an inquiry or an expression of doubt.
  temporal-flow: No specific temporal implications, its function is primarily grammatical/pragmatic.
  spatial-flow: No specific spatial implications, its function is primarily grammatical/pragmatic.
etymology: The particle 「か」 originally indicated a choice or alternative, similar to “or” in English.
  Over time, it evolved to also mark questions by presenting the statement as a possibility, seeking confirmation
  or denial.
writeup: The particle 「か」 is widely used in Japanese and serves a function similar to a question mark
  in English, turning a statement into a question. While most commonly found at the end of a sentence,
  「か」 is not strictly limited to this position and can appear internally in certain structures, particularly
  when forming embedded questions or expressing uncertainty. It frequently follows the polite forms of
  verbs and adjectives, such as 「〜ですか」 or 「〜ますか」, which is typical for N5 level learning. However, in
  more casual conversation, 「か」 can also be directly appended to the plain form of a word or phrase to
  form a question. While grammatically correct, using 「か」 directly with plain forms without 「です」 or 「ます」
  can sound overly direct or even rude in some contexts, particularly if the speaker is not on familiar
  terms with the listener. Beyond explicit questioning, 「か」 can also convey uncertainty or doubt, indicating
  that the speaker is unsure about the preceding statement rather than seeking information from the listener.
false_friends:
  - term: かい
    meaning: Question marker
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「かい」 is a question marker often used by males in casual speech. Unlike 「か」, it is generally
      not used in polite speech.
    grammar_point: かい (casual question particle)
  - term: っけ
    meaning: What is…again?, Was it... that... ?, Did you say...?
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「っけ」 is used to confirm something you thought you knew but are not entirely sure about. 「か」
      is used for general questions.
    grammar_point: っけ (seeking confirmation)
  - term: かどうか
    meaning: whether or not
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「か」 can introduce an embedded question, 「かどうか」 explicitly presents two alternatives
      (X or not X), often implying a need for confirmation or decision.
    grammar_point: かどうか (whether or not)
  - term: かな
    meaning: I wonder if...; I hope...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「かな」 is a combination of 「か」 and sentence-final particle 「な」, expressing personal uncertainty,
      contemplation, or a gentle question, often spoken to oneself or with a soft tone. It's softer than
      a direct 「か」 question.
    grammar_point: かな (I wonder)
  - term: だろうか
    meaning: I wonder if...; Could it be that...?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だろうか」 combines the speculative auxiliary 「だろう」 with 「か」, indicating a stronger sense of conjecture
      or doubt, often posed as a rhetorical question or a deep internal musing. It's more formal or literary
      than 「かな」.
    grammar_point: のだろうか (I wonder)
  - term: かしら
    meaning: I wonder if... (feminine)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「だろうか」 or 「かな」, 「かしら」 is typically used by female speakers to express uncertainty,
      doubt, or a soft inquiry. It carries a more gentle, sometimes contemplative, nuance.
    grammar_point: かしら (soft uncertainty・female)
  - term: の？ (question)
    meaning: Is it that...?; Are you...?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「の？」 is a casual question marker often used by women or when seeking an explanation or confirmation.
      It's less formal than 「のですか？」 and carries a softer, more inquisitive tone than a plain 「か」 question.
    grammar_point: の? (question)
  - term: んですか？
    meaning: Is it that...?; Is that so?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「んですか？」 explicitly asks for an explanation or the reason behind something, often indicating
      the speaker's interest or surprise. While 「か」 simply asks for information, 「んですか？」 probes deeper
      into the underlying circumstances.
    grammar_point: 〜のだ・〜んだ (explanatory)
  - term: でしょう？
    meaning: Right?; Isn't it?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「でしょう？」 implies that the speaker already has an expectation or belief and is seeking agreement
      from the listener. Unlike 「か」, which is a neutral inquiry, 「でしょう？」 is suggestive and expects a confirmation
      rather than new information.
    grammar_point: だろう・でしょう (probably・right?)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「か」, 「かい」, and 「っけ」 are all used to form questions, but they have distinct
  nuances and levels of formality. 「か」 is the most versatile and polite, suitable for a wide range of
  situations. 「かい」 is generally used by males in casual conversation. 「っけ」 is used to confirm something
  you already thought you knew. Additionally, 「かどうか」 explicitly states 'whether or not', 「かな」 expresses
  personal uncertainty or a softer question, 「だろうか」 indicates conjecture or formal doubt, and 「かしら」 is
  a feminine way of expressing similar uncertainty. Furthermore, 「の？」 is a casual way to seek explanation
  or confirmation, often used by women, while 「んですか？」 is a common way to ask for background information
  or reasons. Lastly, 「でしょう？」 is used when the speaker is seeking agreement or confirmation for something
  they already believe to be true.

          question about the apple's characteristic.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この りんご 美味しい {か な}。
        english: I wonder if this apple is delicious.
        hint: 「かな」 expresses personal uncertainty or a softer question, often spoken to oneself. We're
          looking for a direct question.

          - この りんご は 美味しい {でしょ}？
        english: This apple is delicious, right?
        hint: 「でしょう？」 seeks agreement or confirmation, implying the speaker already has an expectation.
          We're looking for a neutral inquiry.
    scene: A child asks their mother about the taste of an apple.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: When a younger female speaker asks her mother (older female listener) 「この りんご は 美味しい です か」,
      it is a polite and appropriate way to ask about a characteristic. For a closer, more casual interaction,
      a child might drop 「です」 and use 「美味しい か」, which is direct and natural between family members. This
      shows the contrast between polite and plain forms with 「か」

    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: Among male university students, using 「毎日 図書 館 へ 行き ます か」 maintains a polite distance typical
      for early acquaintances or general conversation. If they are close friends, 「毎日 図書 館 へ 行く か」 would
      be a more casual and direct inquiry, reflecting their familiar relationship. This highlights the
      contrast between polite and plain forms with 「か」

    scene: A friend asks a close friend about their attendance at an upcoming casual gathering.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: For a female speaker asking a close female friend about party attendance, 「明日 パーティー に 来る か」
      is a very natural and casual inquiry. It shows closeness, eliminating the need for more formal language
      like 「来 ます か」, which would create an unnecessary distance in this friendly context. This highlights
      the contrast between polite and plain forms with 「か」

    scene: Two siblings are looking at an old photo, one asking about the identity of a person in it.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: In an intimate setting between a male speaker and his female sibling, 「彼 は 学生 か」 is a direct
      and natural casual inquiry about someone's status. The omission of 「だ」 or 「です」 emphasizes the casual
      and intimate nature of the sibling relationship, as politeness forms are typically relaxed in such
      contexts. This shows the contrast between polite and plain forms with 「か」
  - english: No one knows when she's coming.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 が いつ 来る {か}、誰 も 分から ない。
      - 彼女 が いつ 来る {か}、誰 も 分かり ませ ん。
    english_literally: She, when she comes (question), no one knows.
    competing_grammar:

        english: This is a statement. We need to express uncertainty or an embedded question about her
          arrival time.
        hint: This is a statement. We need to express uncertainty or an embedded question about her arrival
          time.
    scene: Colleagues are waiting for a team member and discussing their uncertain arrival time.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: In a semi-formal work setting, a female speaker using 「いつ 来る か、誰 も 分から ない」 demonstrates the
      use of 「か」 to form an embedded question, signifying collective uncertainty about a team member's
      arrival time. This structure clearly communicates a lack of information without being impolite.
      This illustrates the use of 「か」 for embedded questions.
  - english: Please check whether it will rain tomorrow.
    japanese:
      - 明日 雨 が 降る {か} どう {か}、確認 し て ください。
      - 明日 雨 が 降る {か} どう {か}、ご 確認 ください。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 雨 が {降る}。
        english: This is a declarative statement. We need to express a request to confirm a possibility.
        hint: This is a declarative statement. We need to express a request to confirm a possibility.
    scene: A supervisor tells an assistant to verify the weather forecast for an outdoor event.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: When a male supervisor instructs a female assistant, the use of 「明日 雨 が 降る か どう か、確認 し て ください」
      is highly appropriate for a formal, instructional setting. The phrase 「か どう か」 explicitly requests
      confirmation regarding two alternatives (rain or no rain), conveying a precise and clear directive
      in a respectful manner. This illustrates the use of 「か どう か」 for choices.
  - english: Did you already finish your homework?
    japanese:
      - 宿題 は もう 終わり {まし た か}
      - 宿題 は もう 終わっ た {か}
      - 宿題 は もう 終わっ た の {か}
    english_literally: Homework, already finished (question)?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 宿題 は もう 終わり {まし た}。
        english: This is a declarative statement. We need to form a question about the homework's completion.
        hint: This is a declarative statement. We need to form a question about the homework's completion.
    scene: A parent asking their child about homework after school.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The mother (older female) using 「終わり ました か」 is a common way for a parent to politely check
      on a child's progress. While 「終わっ た か」 is also possible, 「終わっ た の か」 would imply a deeper probe
      into the circumstances if the child has not finished, seeking an explanation. This illustrates the
      difference in nuance between direct questions and those seeking explanation with 「の か」
  - english: I wonder if this is the right answer.
    japanese:
      - これ で 合っ て いる の {か}
      - これ は 正しい 答え {か} どう {か}
    english_literally: Is this correct answer (question)?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ は 正しい 答え {です}。
        english: This is a declarative statement. We need to express internal doubt or questioning.
        hint: This is a declarative statement. We need to express internal doubt or questioning.
    scene: A student reviewing their exam answers, silently questioning their choices.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: When speaking to oneself, as a male speaker might do while reviewing answers, 「これ で 合っ て いる
      の か」 uses 「の か」 to express internal doubt or questioning. This highlights the speaker pondering
      the correctness of something without requiring an external listener, making the internal process
      explicit with 「か」. This illustrates the use of 「か」 for internal monologue or doubt.
  - english: Shall we go to the cafe or the bookstore?
    japanese:
      - 喫茶 店 に 行く {か}、本 屋 に 行く {か}
      - 喫茶 店 に 行き ます {か}、本 屋 に 行き ます {か}
    english_literally: Cafe go (question), bookstore go (question)?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 喫茶 店 に 行き ます か、{それ と も} 本 屋 に 行き ます か。
        english: This uses 「それとも」 to explicitly state 'or'. We're looking for a more concise way to present
          choices using 「か」.
        hint: This uses 「それとも」 to explicitly state 'or'. We're looking for a more concise way to present
          choices using 「か」.
    scene: Two friends trying to decide where to go on a weekend afternoon.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The repetition of 「行く か」 for each option, such as 「喫茶 店 に 行く か、本 屋 に 行く か」, implicitly presents
      choices and asks for a decision. This structure is common in casual conversation between younger
      female and male friends, indicating a shared decision-making process where politeness is maintained
      but without excessive formality. This illustrates the use of repeated 「か」 for options.
  - english: How could such a thing happen?
    japanese:
      - どう し て こんな こと が 起こる {こと か}
      - どう し て こんな こと に なっ た の {か}
    english_literally: Why such a thing happen (question)?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - どう し て そんな こと が 起こっ た {の です か}。
        english: This is a standard question seeking an answer. We're looking for a rhetorical question
          expressing strong emotion.
        hint: This is a standard question seeking an answer. We're looking for a rhetorical question expressing
          strong emotion.
    scene: Someone reacting with disbelief to an unexpected and negative event.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The phrase 「どうして こんな こと が 起こる こと か」, particularly with 「ことか」, often functions as a rhetorical
      question expressing strong emotion like disbelief or frustration. It's not seeking an answer but
      rather emphasizing the unacceptability or inexplicability of the situation. The older male speaker's
      use reflects a sense of profound perplexity, often directed at no one in particular. This illustrates
      the use of 「か」 in rhetorical questions for strong emotion.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 「か」 serves not only to form direct questions but
  also to express uncertainty or embed questions within larger sentences. The level of formality and the
  nuance conveyed can change depending on whether 「です/ます」 forms are used, or if other particles like 「な」
  or 「よ」 accompany it, or if it's used in specific structures like 「〜か どう か」. Other question-marking particles
  like 「の？」, 「んですか？」, and 「でしょう？」 also exist, each carrying its own distinct nuance regarding formality,
  speaker's intention, and expected response.
