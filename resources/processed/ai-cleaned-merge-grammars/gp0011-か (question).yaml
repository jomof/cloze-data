    "etymology": "The particle 「か」 originally indicated a choice or alternative, similar to \"or\" in English. Over time, it evolved to also mark questions by presenting the statement as a possibility, seeking confirmation or denial.",
    "writeup": "「か」 is a particle that frequently comes at the end of sentences in Japanese and functions similarly to a question mark in English. While it most commonly appears at the end of sentences, it can also express uncertainty or doubt about something without necessarily forming a question. 「か」 often follows the polite form of words, such as 「～ですか」 or 「～ますか」. However, in casual conversation, 「か」 can be used directly after the word the speaker is showing uncertainty about. Both usages are grammatically correct, but omitting 「です」 might be considered rude by some, as it sounds too familiar or direct.",
