    "etymology": "The particle 「か」 originally indicated a choice or alternative, similar to \"or\" in English. Over time, it evolved to also mark questions by presenting the statement as a possibility, seeking confirmation or denial.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「か」 is widely used in Japanese and serves a function similar to a question mark in English, turning a statement into a question. While most commonly found at the end of a sentence, 「か」 is not strictly limited to this position and can appear internally in certain structures, particularly when forming embedded questions or expressing uncertainty. It frequently follows the polite forms of verbs and adjectives, such as 「〜ですか」 or 「〜ますか」, which is typical for N5 level learning. However, in more casual conversation, 「か」 can also be directly appended to the plain form of a word or phrase to form a question. While grammatically correct, using 「か」 directly with plain forms without 「です」 or 「ます」 can sound overly direct or even rude in some contexts, particularly if the speaker is not on familiar terms with the listener. Beyond explicit questioning, 「か」 can also convey uncertainty or doubt, indicating that the speaker is unsure about the preceding statement rather than seeking information from the listener.",
