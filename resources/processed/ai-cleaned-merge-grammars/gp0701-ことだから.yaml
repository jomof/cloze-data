    "etymology": "「ことだから」 is a combination of 「こと」 (koto), meaning \"thing\" or \"matter\", 「だ」 (da), the copula, and 「から」 (kara), meaning \"because\" or \"since\". The literal sense is like saying \"because it is a matter of X,\" emphasizing that the inherent nature of X leads to a certain conclusion.",
    "writeup": "「ことだから」 is used to express that the speaker is making an assumption or judgment based on their knowledge or experience of a particular person or situation. It conveys a sense of \"because it is the nature of X, then Y is likely to be the case.\" It can also suggest that a known situation presents a good opportunity to do something else.\n\nIt's similar to saying \"knowing [person/thing] as I do...\" or \"because that's just how [person/thing] is...\" Examples often follow verbs in their dictionary forms or nouns followed by 「の」. The speaker's intended meaning will usually be clear in context. 「ことだから」 emphasizes the speaker's certainty or strong belief based on prior experience or knowledge.",
