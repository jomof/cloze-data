        "source": "Bunpro, DOJG"
    },
    "etymology": "「ことだから」 is formed from 「こと」 (koto), meaning 'thing' or 'matter', followed by 「だ」 (da), the plain form of the copula, and 「から」 (kara), indicating 'because' or 'from'. Its literal interpretation can be seen as 'from the fact that it is a certain matter (or state)', leading to a logical consequence. This construction emphasizes that the conclusion drawn is a natural and expected outcome given the established nature of the subject or situation.",
    "writeup": "「ことだから」 is a grammatical expression used to convey that the speaker is drawing a conclusion or making a strong assumption about something (B) based on their prior knowledge or understanding of a particular person, thing, or situation (A). It carries a nuance of certainty or predictability, suggesting that given how (A) inherently is, (B) is the logical or expected outcome.\n\nThis pattern often translates to phrases like \"knowing X, Y will happen,\" \"given X's nature, Y is expected,\" or \"precisely because it is X, Y.\" It's commonly used when discussing the habitual behavior of a person or the intrinsic characteristics of a situation.\n\nThere are generally two main structural patterns:\n\n1.  **Noun + のことだから**: This form is primarily used when the assumption is based on a specific person's character, habits, or a thing's known properties. For instance, if you know someone is always late, you might use this form to predict their tardiness.\n\n2.  **Verb/Adjective (plain form) + ことだから** or **Sentence (plain form) + ことだから**: This form is used when the conclusion is based on a specific situation, circumstance, or a general fact. It can indicate that a certain situation provides a natural opportunity for something else to occur, or simply emphasize a causal link based on a given state of affairs.\n\nRegardless of the specific nuance—whether it's an assumption about someone's behavior, an indication of opportunity, or a strong causal link—the core idea behind 「ことだから」 remains: 'by the logic of (A), (B) is definitely (or very likely) true'. The context of the sentence (the B part) usually clarifies the speaker's precise intent.",
