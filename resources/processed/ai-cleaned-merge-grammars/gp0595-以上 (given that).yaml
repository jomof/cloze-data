    "etymology": "以上 (ijō) literally means \"above\" or \"more than.\" In this grammatical context, it implies that given a certain condition or state being 'above' a certain point, certain consequences or actions follow.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 以上 (ijō) is a formal expression indicating \"since,\" \"now that,\" or \"as long as\" a certain condition is met. It's not commonly used in everyday casual speech. You'll often see it with は (wa), as in 以上は, to emphasize the condition. When used with verbs and い-adjectives, use their plain forms directly before 以上. For な-adjectives and nouns, use である以上. The second part of the sentence often expresses the speaker's resolution, intention, or a necessary action that follows from the given condition, often using expressions like べきだ, つもりだ, はずだ, たい, or ほうがいい.",
