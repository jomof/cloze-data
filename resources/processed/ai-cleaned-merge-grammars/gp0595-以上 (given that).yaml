    "etymology": "The word 「以上」 (いじょう) literally means \"above\" or \"more than.\" In this grammatical construction, it signifies that something has already been established or is a given, serving as a foundational premise. The subsequent clause then describes what logically or necessarily follows from that established fact. This reflects the original spatial or quantitative meaning of 'above' being extended to a conceptual 'beyond' or 'given' point.",
    "writeup": "「以上」 is a formal grammatical structure used to express that, given a certain condition or situation, a particular consequence, action, or state is expected or necessary. It conveys the sense of \"now that,\" \"since,\" or \"as long as\" something is the case. This construction is typically formal and is less common in very casual daily speech, though it can appear in certain casual contexts for emphasis or when expressing a strong personal resolve.\n\nIt can attach to verbs and い-adjectives in their plain forms. For な-adjectives and nouns, it requires the copula 「である」 before 「以上」. For example, 「プロである以上」 (as long as you are a professional) or 「真剣である以上」 (as long as you are serious). The particle 「は」 can optionally follow 「以上」 (e.g., 「以上は」), further emphasizing the premise, though it is often omitted.\n\nThe clause following 「以上」 often expresses the speaker's resolution, an obligation, or a logical conclusion. This usually appears in the form of 「べきだ」 (should), 「つもりだ」 (intend to), 「はずだ」 (it should be), 「たい」 (want to), 「ほうがいい」 (it's better to), or similar patterns that convey certainty, determination, or necessity. The idea is that once the initial condition (A) is met, the outcome (B) is either obvious, unavoidable, or absolutely required.\n\nA helpful way to think about this pattern is to consider the literal meaning of 「以上」 as \"above and beyond\" or \"once this point is reached.\" It highlights that anything \"past\" or \"beyond\" the established condition (A) leads inevitably to (B).",
