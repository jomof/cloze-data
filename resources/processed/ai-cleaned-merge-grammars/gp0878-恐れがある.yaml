    "etymology": "「恐れがある」 is composed of 「恐れ」(osore), meaning 'fear' or 'risk,' the particle 「が」(ga), and 「ある」(aru), meaning 'to exist' or 'to be.' Literally, it means 'there is fear.'",
    "writeup": "「恐れがある」 is a Japanese set phrase used in a formal context to convey the possibility or risk of something undesirable occurring. It's a combination of the noun 「恐れ」 (osore, \"fear\"), the particle 「が」(ga), and the verb 「ある」 (aru, \"to be\"). It is used when referring to a negative outcome that may potentially occur in a particular situation, and is used to warn about being careful of something. It often carries the nuance of something that innately causes concern. Other common combinations include 「恐れを抱く」 (\"to hold a fear\") and 「恐れが強まる」 (\"the fear intensifies\").",
