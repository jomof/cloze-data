    "etymology": "The grammar point 「恐れがある」 (osore ga aru) is composed of the noun 「恐れ」 (osore), meaning 'fear', 'apprehension', or 'risk', the particle 「が」 (ga), and the verb 「ある」 (aru), meaning 'to exist' or 'to be'. Therefore, its literal meaning is 'there is fear' or 'there is a risk'. Historically, the word 「恐れ」 has been used to express a sense of dread or awe. Over time, its usage expanded to denote a potential negative outcome, aligning with its current grammatical function. Common fixed expressions also include 「恐れを抱く」 (osore o idaku, 'to harbor fear') and 「恐れが強まる」 (osore ga tsuyomaru, 'fear intensifies'), showcasing its semantic versatility within Japanese.",
    "writeup": "「恐れがある」 is a formal Japanese expression used to indicate the **possibility or risk of an undesirable event or outcome**. It directly translates to 'there is a fear that...' or 'there is a risk that...'. This grammar point is commonly employed in warnings, official announcements, news reports, and academic contexts where caution regarding potential negative consequences is paramount.\nThe core meaning hinges on the noun 「恐れ」 (osore), which conveys a sense of apprehension, anxiety, or danger. Thus, 「恐れがある」 is specifically used when the potential outcome is negative or carries a degree of concern. It is generally not used for neutral or positive possibilities.\n\n**Formation:**\n*   **[Noun] + の + 恐れがある**: Used when the risk is directly associated with a noun. For example, 「地震の恐れがある」 (jishin no osore ga aru, 'there is a risk of an earthquake').\n*   **[Verb (plain form)] + 恐れがある**: Used when the risk is related to an action. For example, 「倒壊する恐れがある」 (tōkai suru osore ga aru, 'there is a risk of collapsing').\n*   **[な-Adjective stem] + である/だった/であった + 恐れがある**: Used when the risk pertains to a state described by a na-adjective. For example, 「不安定である恐れがある」 (fuan tei de aru osore ga aru, 'there is a risk of being unstable').\n*   **[Noun] + である/だった/であった + 恐れがある**: Used when the risk refers to the noun itself being a problematic state or type. For example, 「不良品である恐れがある」 (furyōhin de aru osore ga aru, 'there is a risk of it being a defective product').\n\n**Nuance and Usage:**\nThis expression carries a formal and serious tone. It is often used to issue warnings or state concerns in a detached, objective manner. While similar expressions like 「～かもしれない」 (might, perhaps) or 「～可能性がある」 (there is a possibility) exist, 「恐れがある」 distinctly emphasizes the **negative aspect** and the inherent **concern or danger** associated with the potential event. It implicitly urges caution or preventive action.\nConsidered a stiff (硬い) expression, it is less common in everyday casual conversation and more prevalent in written language, public announcements, and professional settings. When encountering this phrase, it signals that the speaker or writer is communicating a significant potential hazard or problem.",

            "term": "かねない",
            "meaning": "Might, Could be, Capable of, Possible",
            "kind": "often confused with",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「恐れがある」, 「かねない」 often implies a higher degree of likelihood or possibility, especially of a negative outcome. 「かねない」 also lacks the formal tone of 「恐れがある」, making it more common in conversational warnings."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「恐れがある」 and 「かねない」 indicate possibility, 「恐れがある」 tends to be used in more formal situations and emphasizes the **potential negative consequence**. It conveys a more objective and serious assessment of risk. 「かねない」, on the other hand, is more versatile and can be used in less formal settings, focusing on the **probability** of something happening, often implying a stronger sense of likelihood and sometimes a judgment that someone or something is capable of an undesirable action.",
