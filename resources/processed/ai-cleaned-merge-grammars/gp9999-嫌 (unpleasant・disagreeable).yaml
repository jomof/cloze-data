jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Expressing strong aversion, refusal, or describing something as unpleasant. Can be used
    as a standalone exclamation.
  function: To express a strong negative feeling or rejection.
  nuance: While it can function similarly to 嫌い (dislike), 嫌 often conveys a more visceral reaction, a
    feeling of "ugh, no" or "I detest this." It can also describe something as inherently "disagreeable"
    or "unpleasant" rather than just a personal preference. As an interjection, it is a direct and emphatic
    "No!" or "I don't want to!".
etymology: The word 嫌 (iya) is a native Japanese word, a Yamato Kotoba, that has existed since ancient
  times. Its original meaning conveyed a sense of "aversion" or "discomfort," often linked to physical
  repulsion or an emotional state of being displeased. The kanji 嫌 (けん/いや) itself combines 女 (woman) and
  兼 (to combine/hold two things), which some etymological theories suggest might relate to the complexity
  or emotional depth often associated with human feelings of aversion, though this is speculative and
  the phonetic origin (いや) is more direct. Over time, it developed its usage as both a noun for "disagreeable
  things" and as a な-adjective expressing "unpleasantness" or "hatefulness," alongside its strong interjectional
  use for "No!" or "I don't want to!". Its directness and strong emotional connotation distinguish it
  from other expressions of dislike.
writeup: |-
  「嫌」is a versatile word used to express strong feelings of unpleasantness, dislike, or aversion. It functions primarily as a な-adjective, but it is also very commonly used as a direct interjection or a standalone expression of refusal.

  When used as a な-adjective, 「嫌な」modifies a noun, describing it as "unpleasant," "disagreeable," or "hateful." For example, 「{嫌な}天気」means "unpleasant weather." It can also be used predicatively with a copula, such as 「この仕事は{嫌だ}」 ("This job is unpleasant/I dislike this job"). The feeling expressed by 「嫌」 is often stronger and more visceral than simply "I don't like it." It suggests a more profound aversion or detestation.

  As an interjection, 「{嫌}！」is a direct and emphatic "No!" or "I don't want to!" or "I hate it!". This usage is very common in casual speech, especially when expressing a strong refusal or immediate dislike to a suggestion or situation. For instance, if someone offers you food you don't like, you might simply say 「{嫌}！」. This directness makes it a powerful expression of personal will or feeling.

  It's important to note the nuance difference from 「嫌い」. While both relate to dislike, 「嫌い」 (嫌いな) specifically describes a personal preference of "dislike" for something (e.g., 「私は野菜が嫌いだ」 "I dislike vegetables"). 「嫌」 (嫌な), on the other hand, can describe an inherent unpleasantness of something (e.g., 「{嫌な}におい」 "an unpleasant smell") or a general strong aversion/refusal that may not always be about personal taste but about an overall disagreeable nature. In some contexts, they are interchangeable, especially when expressing a personal strong dislike, but 「嫌」 often carries a more immediate, emotional, or even disgusted connotation.

    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「苦手」 implies a dislike stemming from a lack of skill, inability, or general discomfort/awkwardness

    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This expression implies a feeling of annoyance, dissatisfaction, or displeasure with a specific
      thing or situation, often suggesting that it goes against one's expectations or preferences. It
      can be stronger than simple dislike, hinting at a feeling of something being "not right" or "unacceptable."
    grammar_point: <suggest>:気に食わない (to be displeased with)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「嫌」, 「嫌い」, 「苦手」, and 「気に食わない」 all express negative sentiments, their
  nuances differ. 「嫌」 conveys a visceral "unpleasantness" or "no!" often immediate and strong. 「嫌い」 is
  a personal, general dislike. 「苦手」 signifies a dislike due to inability or discomfort. 「気に食わない」 suggests
  dissatisfaction or annoyance because something isn't meeting expectations. Understanding these subtle
  differences will help you choose the most appropriate expression in various situations.
