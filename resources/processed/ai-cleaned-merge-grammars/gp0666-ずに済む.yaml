    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ずに済む」 is composed of 「ず」, an old-fashioned literary negative auxiliary verb similar to 「ない」, 「に」, a particle, and 「済む(すむ)」, a verb meaning \"to finish,\" \"to be completed,\" or \"to get by\". So, 「ずに済む」 literally means \"to finish without doing something.\" The core meaning revolves around 'sumu' (済む) signifying completion or resolution, which, when combined with the negative 'zu' (ず), implies that a certain action did not need to be performed for the situation to resolve favorably.",
    "writeup": "「ずに済む」 is a grammatical construction used to express that one was able to \"get by without doing (A)\" or that \"it's no problem without (A).\" This structure signifies that a potentially undesirable or burdensome action was successfully avoided, often resulting in a sense of relief for the speaker.\n\nThe construction comprises 「ず」, a classical auxiliary verb that functions similarly to 「ない」 in its negative connotation, followed by the particle 「に」, and finally the verb 「済む (すむ)」, meaning \"to be finished,\" \"to be completed,\" or \"to get by.\"\n\nLiterally, the phrase can be understood as \"it will resolve or work out without (A) being done.\" The 「ず」 component attaches to verbs in the same manner as 「ない」, indicating the action that is being negated or avoided.\n\nWhile 「ずに済む」 is a common and versatile expression, variations such as 「ないで済む」 or 「なしで済む」 are also encountered. 「ないで済む」 is a more colloquial and direct equivalent using the modern negative form 「ない」. 「なしで済む」 is particularly useful when referring to the absence of a noun rather than a verb, as 「無し (なし)」 functions as a suffix meaning \"without\" and can attach directly to nouns.\n\nIn most applications, the action (A) that is avoided is typically something considered unpleasant, troublesome, or a burden, which underscores the speaker's relief or satisfaction in its successful circumvention.",

            "nuance": "「必要がない」 expresses a neutral lack of necessity. It does not carry the implication of avoiding an inconvenience or the feeling of relief that 「ずに済む」 does. It's a factual statement, not an expression of fortunate avoidance."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「ずに」 simply means \"without doing,\" 「ずに済む」 adds the nuance of successfully avoiding something, often with a sense of relief. For instance, 「朝ご飯を食べずに学校へ行った」 (I went to school without eating breakfast) is a neutral statement of fact. In contrast, 「朝ご飯を食べずに済んだ」 (I got by without eating breakfast) implies that skipping breakfast was not a problem or was even a good thing in that situation.\n\n「ないで済む」 is a more colloquial and common variant of 「ずに済む」, carrying essentially the same meaning. 「なしで済む」 is specifically used when avoiding a noun (e.g., 「エアコンなしで済む」 - 'get by without air conditioning'), whereas 「ずに済む」 is for avoiding an action.\n\nFinally, 「なくてもいい」 and 「必要がない」 both indicate a lack of necessity. However, they are more neutral and do not convey the same sense of relief or successful avoidance of an undesirable task that is central to 「ずに済む」. 「ずに済む」 suggests a fortunate outcome where an action that might have been expected or troublesome was averted.",
