    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ずに済む」 is composed of 「ず」, an old-fashioned literary negative auxiliary verb similar to 「ない」, 「に」, a particle, and 「済む(すむ)」, a verb meaning \"to finish,\" \"to be completed,\" or \"to get by\". So, 「ずに済む」 literally means \"to finish without doing something.\"",
    "writeup": "「ずに済む」 indicates that one can \"get away without doing (A)\", or \"it's no problem without (A)\".\n\nThis structure combines 「ず」, a literary auxiliary verb with similar function to 「ない」, 「に」, and 「済む」, a verb meaning \"to come to pass\" or \"to end up\". It can be thought of as meaning \"it will work out without (A)\". 「ず」 connects to verbs similarly to 「ない」, appearing after the verb stem.\n\nVariations like 「ないですむ」 or 「なしですむ」 are also possible, with 「無しで」 functioning as a suffix directly after nouns, unlike 「ないで」 and 「ずに」.\n\nTypically, (A) is something unpleasant or bothersome, highlighting the speaker's relief at avoiding it.",
