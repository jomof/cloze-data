    "etymology": "The structure combines the particle 「も」, indicating 'also' or 'too,' with the conditional 「ば」 form of a verb or adjective, creating a parallel structure that emphasizes the co-occurrence of two related elements. The repeated 「も」 emphasizes that both elements are true or applicable.",
    "writeup": "The 「も〜ば〜も」 construction in Japanese highlights that if one thing is true, another related thing is also true. It emphasizes that traits or characteristics often go hand-in-hand. The general idea is \"If (A) is true, then (B) is also true.\"\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n*   「も」 connects to a noun.\n*   「ば」 follows a verb, い-adjective, な-adjective, or noun. For nouns and な-adjectives, use 「なら」 or 「ならば」.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Both traits must share a mutual connection; they should both be positive, neutral, or negative.\n*   It's unnatural to mix positive and negative traits in this construction.\n*   Be mindful of the register; it's generally considered standard.",
