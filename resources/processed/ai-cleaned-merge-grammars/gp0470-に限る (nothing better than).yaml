    },
    "etymology": "「に限る」 is derived from the particle 「に」 (indicating location or scope) and the verb 「限る(かぎる)」 (to limit). The combination expresses the idea of something being limited to or being the best within a certain scope or context. Literally, it means 'to set a boundary on', implying the best thing is within that boundary or is restricted to that boundary.",
    "writeup": "「に限る」 combines the particle 「に」, indicating location or scope, and the verb 「限る」, meaning \"to limit\". It expresses the idea that something is the best, most suitable, or limited to a specific condition. It can be translated as \"nothing beats,\" \"there's nothing like,\" or \"limited to.\"\n\nWhen used with a **noun**, it indicates a strong preference or that something is limited to that noun.\n\nWhen used with a **verb in dictionary form**, it suggests that doing that action is the best option. For example, 「疲れた 時 は 寝る に 限る」 (When you're tired, sleeping is the best).\n\nWhen used with a **verb in negative form (ない)**, it expresses that *not* doing something is the best option. For instance, 「試験 前 は 夜更かし し ない に 限る」 (Before an exam, it's best not to stay up late).\n\nThis expression is generally used in casual or standard contexts, though its meaning of \"limited to\" can appear in more formal settings, such as official announcements.\n\nThe literal meaning of 「限る」 is 「境 を 付ける」 (to set a boundary). This means that 「に」 marks the location (or situation), within which the speaker then states as being 'the boundary'. Because of this, 'to be bound to', or 'to be limited to', are also possible translations of 「に限る」.",
