    "etymology": "The particle 「ばかり」 originally meant \"only\" or \"just.\" When attached to a verb in the past tense (た-form), it indicates that an action has just been completed.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「たばかり」 indicates that something has **just** happened or finished. It emphasizes the freshness or recency of the action. 「たばかり」 is similar to \"just\" in English, as in \"I just ate,\" implying the action of eating finished moments ago. You may also encounter casual variations like 「ばっかり」, 「ばっか」, 「ばかし」, and 「ばっかし」.",
