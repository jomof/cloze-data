    "etymology": "The particle 「ばかり」 originally meant \"only\" or \"just.\" When attached to a verb in the past tense (た-form), it indicates that an action has just been completed.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「たばかり」 indicates that something has **just** happened or finished. It emphasizes the freshness or recency of the action. 「たばかり」 is similar to \"just\" in English, as in \"I just ate,\" implying the action of eating finished moments ago. You may also encounter casual variations like 「ばっかり」, 「ばっか」, 「ばかし」, and 「ばっかし」.",

So, for example, if the grammar point is JLPT N3, the example sentences should use kanji from the N3, N4, and N5 lists. Don't just convert the sentences to hiragana, create a sentence that uses vocabulary appropriate to that level.' This ensures pedagogical consistency with the N4 JLPT level.",
