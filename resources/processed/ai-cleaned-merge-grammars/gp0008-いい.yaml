    "etymology": "The origin of いい can be traced back to the verb 癒ゆ (iyu), meaning \"to heal\" or \"to recover.\" Over time, it evolved to express general favorability and satisfaction, eventually becoming the adjective いい we use today.",
    "writeup": "いい is an い-adjective that primarily means \"good\" in Japanese. However, it's essential to understand that いい conjugates somewhat irregularly compared to most other い-adjectives. Observe how the first い changes to よ in various forms.\n\nいい can also be written as 良い. Although technically there is no difference in meaning, 良い (yoi) often sounds more formal or old-fashioned.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   When used as an adverb, よく (yoku) should not be confused as a conjugation of いい. よく has several possible kanji and means \"frequently,\" \"often,\" or \"well.\"",
