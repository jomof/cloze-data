    "etymology": "The adjective 「いい」 originates from the older Japanese word 「良し (よし)」, which also means 'good.' Over time, 「よし」 evolved into 「いい」. The kanji 「良い」 is still used, but it's often read as 「よい」, which sounds more formal or old-fashioned. The modern reading 「いい」 is more common in everyday conversation.",
    "writeup": "「いい」 is an **i-adjective** in Japanese, primarily meaning 'good'. Its conjugation is notably irregular, deviating from the typical patterns of other i-adjectives. A key characteristic of this irregularity is the change of its initial `い` to `よ` in many conjugated forms (e.g., `よくない`, `よかった`). This specific phonetic shift is unique to 「いい」 and is crucial for its accurate usage.\n\nWhile 「いい」 is the commonly used form in modern Japanese, it can also be written with the kanji 「良い」. When written this way, it is often read as 「よい」, which carries a more formal or antiquated nuance compared to the conversational 「いい」. There is no fundamental difference in meaning between 「いい」 and 「よい」, but the choice between them reflects a difference in register.\n\n**Important Note on 「よく」:**\nWhen 「いい」 is conjugated, its stem changes to 「よ」. However, the adverb 「よく」 (meaning 'frequently/often' or 'well') should not be confused with a direct conjugation of 「いい」. While etymologically related, 「よく」 functions independently as an adverb and does not mean 'good' in the same adjectival sense as 「いい」. This distinction is vital for understanding its varied uses.",

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「良い」 and 「いい」 both mean 'good', 「よい」 (the common reading of 「良い」) adds a touch of formality or traditional nuance. In most everyday conversations, 「いい」 is more common and natural. Think of 「よい」 as something you might encounter in classic literature or very polite, formal speech. Furthermore, do not confuse 「いい」 with the adverb 「よく」. Although 「よく」 is the stem used in many conjugations of 「いい」 (e.g., 「よくない」), it also exists independently as an adverb meaning 'frequently/often' or 'well', completely unrelated to the adjective's core meaning. Context is paramount in distinguishing these uses. Lastly, 「悪い」 is the direct antonym for 'bad,' which is distinct from simply 'not good' (よくない).",
