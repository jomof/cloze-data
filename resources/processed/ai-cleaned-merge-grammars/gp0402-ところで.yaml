    "etymology": "「ところで」 is composed of 「所 (tokoro)」 meaning \"place\" or \"point,\" and the particle 「で (de)」, indicating location or means. The phrase literally means \"at the point,\" but its usage evolved to signify a shift in the conversation to another 'point' or topic.",
    "writeup": "「ところで」 is a conjunction formed from the noun 「所 (tokoro)」, meaning \"place\" or \"point,\" and the particle 「で (de)」. Its literal translation is closer to 'and with that'. It functions similarly to \"by the way\" or \"incidentally\" in English, serving to introduce a completely new topic in a conversation. It signals a clear shift from the current subject to something entirely unrelated. The nuance conveyed is that something from the previous topic subtly reminded the speaker of another matter, prompting the introduction of a new subject. 「ところで」 is typically placed at the beginning of a sentence, followed by the new statement or question. This usage is distinct from phrases that add further information within the same topic or refer to closely related matters.",
