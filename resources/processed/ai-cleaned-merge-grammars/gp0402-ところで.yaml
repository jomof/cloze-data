    "etymology": "「ところで」 is composed of 「所 (tokoro)」 meaning \"place\" or \"point,\" and the particle 「で (de)」, indicating location or means. The phrase literally means \"at the point,\" but its usage evolved to signify a shift in the conversation to another 'point' or topic.",
    "writeup": "「ところで」 is a conjunction used to introduce a new topic in a conversation, similar to \"by the way\" or \"incidentally\" in English. It signals a shift from the current subject to something unrelated. It implies that something in the previous topic reminded the speaker of the new one. 「ところで」 is typically placed at the beginning of a sentence to indicate this transition. This is different than using phrases to add additional information to the current conversation.",

            "speaker_gender": "female",
            "listener_gender": "female",
            "nuance": "The verb ending 「～てらっしゃる」 (te rassharu) is a highly respectful and formal form of address, often favored by female speakers in Japanese to convey utmost politeness and deference, especially when inquiring about another's family member. The honorific 「お」 before 「元気」 further enhances this refined and considerate tone, typical of women in polite discourse."
