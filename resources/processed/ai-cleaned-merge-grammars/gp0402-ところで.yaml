    "etymology": "「ところで」 is composed of 「所 (tokoro)」 meaning \"place\" or \"point,\" and the particle 「で (de)」, indicating location or means. The phrase literally means \"at the point,\" but its usage evolved to signify a shift in the conversation to another 'point' or topic.",
    "writeup": "「ところで」 is a conjunction formed from the noun 「所 (tokoro)」, meaning \"place\" or \"point,\" and the particle 「で (de)」. Its literal translation is closer to 'and with that'. It functions similarly to \"by the way\" or \"incidentally\" in English, serving to introduce a completely new topic in a conversation. It signals a clear shift from the current subject to something entirely unrelated. The nuance conveyed is that something from the previous topic subtly reminded the speaker of another matter, prompting the introduction of a new subject. 「ところで」 is typically placed at the beginning of a sentence, followed by the new statement or question. This usage is distinct from phrases that add further information within the same topic or refer to closely related matters.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene implies that the current conversation is not about 'yesterday's plan,' making {ところで} the appropriate choice for a clear topic shift, whereas そういえば might imply a continued connection within the same context."

            "listener_gender": "female",
            "nuance": "The verb ending 「～てらっしゃる」 (te rassharu) is a highly respectful and formal form of address, often favored by female speakers in Japanese to convey utmost politeness and deference, especially when inquiring about another's family member. The honorific 「お」 before 「元気」 further enhances this refined and considerate tone, typical of women in polite discourse."

            "nuance": "The phrase 「どちらへお出かけですか？」 is a polite way to ask about someone's destination, often used by women in polite conversation. The use of 「お出かけ」 (odekake), the honorific 「お」, and the polite verb ending 「ですか」 (desu ka) creates a respectful and considerate tone."
