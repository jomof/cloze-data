    "etymology": "This grammar point 「く」 is the continuative form (連用形 ren'yōkei) of い-adjectives. It functions similarly to the te-form 「～て」 for verbs and na-adjectives, connecting clauses or providing a reason.",
    "writeup": "The 「く」 form is used to connect い-adjectives, indicating a sequence of characteristics or actions. It's similar in function to the 「～て」 form for verbs and na-adjectives but is **exclusively for い-adjectives**. It's typically found in **written or formal speech** to create a more sophisticated tone. It effectively means \"and\" or \"so\" when connecting clauses, describing attributes, or giving reasons. Think of it as a literary or slightly elevated version of 「～くて」.",
