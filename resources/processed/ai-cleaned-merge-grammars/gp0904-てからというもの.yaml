        "function": "Connects a past event to an ongoing state or consequence.",
        "nuance": "Implies a dramatic and lasting shift, often for a prolonged period, emphasizing the continuous nature of the subsequent state or effect. It suggests that once the initial event occurred, the resulting situation or change became permanent and continuous.",

    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てからというもの」 combines 「てから」 (after), signifying a temporal sequence, with 「というもの」. The latter can be conceptualized as \"that which is\" or \"what is called.\" This combination emphasizes the continuous state or result that has persistently emerged since the initial action or event took place. It functions as a set phrase to highlight the enduring consequences of a past occurrence.",
    "writeup": "「てからというもの」 functions as an extension of the basic temporal connector 「てから」. It is used to indicate that a specific state or condition has continued uninterruptedly, or a particular change has persisted, ever since a certain event occurred. This structure implies a direct and lasting cause-and-effect relationship, where action A leads to continuous state B.\n\nWhile often translated as \"ever since,\" the nuance is that \"from the point of that (A), something came to be, and that state has continued.\" The phrase itself carries this implication of ongoing effect. It generally follows verbs in their て-form.\n\nOccasionally, 「それからというもの」 can be observed at the beginning of a new sentence. In such instances, 「それ」 refers to the event or situation previously mentioned, establishing a clear link between that antecedent and the subsequent continuous state.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\n\nThis phrase implicitly highlights a significant and lasting change. Consequently, it is generally not employed for events that occurred in the very recent past and whose effects have not yet become established as an ongoing condition. The determination of what constitutes a 'long enough' duration is subjective and context-dependent, relying on the perceived lasting impact of the event.",

            "nuance": "While ～以来 also means 'since,' it is more neutral and merely marks a starting point in time. It doesn't carry the strong implication of a profound and continuous change or state as a direct consequence, which is central to てからというもの.",

        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「てからというもの」, 「～てから」, and 「～以来」 can all be translated as \"since\" or \"after,\" their nuances differ. 「～てから」 simply denotes a temporal sequence, meaning \"after doing X, Y happened.\" It doesn't imply a lasting effect. 「～以来」 specifies a starting point in time, meaning \"since X, Y has continued.\" It is more neutral regarding the nature of Y's continuation. In contrast, 「てからというもの」 strongly emphasizes that the event or state Y has been continuously and profoundly affected as a direct result of the preceding event X, implying a significant, lasting transformation or condition. It highlights a strong cause-and-effect relationship leading to an ongoing, usually remarkable, state.",
