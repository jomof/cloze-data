  details:
    part-of-speech: phrase
    register: semi-formal
    usage-context: General usage
    function: Used to introduce a related topic or shift focus within a conversation.
    nuance: Indicates a connection between the current topic and a new, related one; can imply association,
      typical examples, or a strong reaction depending on context and other similar expressions.
  etymology: 「といえば」 is a combination of 「と」 (a particle indicating a quote, thought, or condition), and
    「言えば」 (the conditional form of the verb 「言う」 meaning "to say"). Thus, it literally translates to "if
    you say..." or "if it were the case that...". This structure highlights its function as a conversational
    pivot, essentially asking the listener to consider the topic "if it were to be spoken of."
  writeup: '「といえば」, 「と言うと」, and 「と言ったら」 are nuanced expressions that can all be broadly translated as "speaking
    of (A)" or "if it were the case that (A)". While they share a similar core function, each carries a
    slightly different nuance: **「といえば」**: Often used to introduce a topic that naturally comes to mind
    when a previous topic is mentioned. It can also imply a hypothetical or general characteristic related
    to the noun. It''s versatile and can subtly shift the conversation. **「と言うと」**: More concrete, often
    used when clarifying or referring to a specific instance or a well-known fact related to the previously
    mentioned item. It can also imply "when you mention (A), it brings to mind...". **「と言ったら」**: Often used
    to express a strong emotional reaction, emphasis, or a definitive characteristic about the topic. It
    can also be used to present a typical or representative example with a sense of finality. These constructions
    are most commonly used after nouns and are often employed in response to something that has already
    been mentioned in the conversation (typically by someone else). The previously discussed subject frequently
    acts as a ''trigger'' for the speaker to recall something related, prompting them to interject with
    one of these phrases. **Important Consideration:** While these phrases are used in response to an existing
    topic, their primary purpose is to either slightly shift the direction of the conversation or to introduce
    new, related information, rather than simply reiterating the original subject.'

    - term: そういえば
      meaning: Speaking of which, By the way, Come to think of it
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: Unlike 「といえば」, 「そういえば」 is often used to introduce a thought that suddenly comes to mind, without
        necessarily being directly related to the immediate previous topic, or it's a sudden realization.
      grammar_point: そういえば (speaking of which)
    - term: ところで
      meaning: By the way, Incidentally
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: Unlike 「といえば」, 「ところで」 is typically used to completely change the topic of conversation to
        something unrelated, serving as a distinct transition marker.
      grammar_point: ところで (by the way)
    - term: は
      meaning: As for... (Highlights sentence topic)
      kind: often confused with
      nuance: Unlike 「といえば」, 「は」 simply marks the topic of the sentence without necessarily implying a connection
        to a previous statement or introducing a new, related idea as a conversational pivot.
      grammar_point: は (topic and contrast)
    - term: って
      meaning: As for, Speaking of, Casual は (Sentence topic marker)
      kind: often confused with
      nuance: Unlike 「といえば」, 「って」 is a more casual way to mark the topic, often implying a shared understanding
        or familiarity, and doesn't carry the nuanced conditional or emphatic sense of 「といえば」.
      grammar_point: って (casual topic marker)
    - term: について
      meaning: Concerning, about, regarding
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While 「といえば」 introduces a topic that naturally comes to mind or is a typical example, 「について」
        simply indicates what the discussion is 'about' or 'regarding' without the conversational pivot
        or associative nuance.
      grammar_point: について (about)
    - term: たとえば
      meaning: For example
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「といえば」 can sometimes introduce typical examples, but 「たとえば」 is a direct adverb used specifically
        to give an example, often for clarification, and doesn't have the conversational shift aspect of
        「といえば」.
      grammar_point: たとえば (for example)
    - term: 何といっても
      meaning: By any account, all the same, no doubt
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「何といっても」 emphasizes a statement by asserting it's true regardless of what others might say,
        or that something is definitively the best or most representative. While 「と言ったら」 can also emphasize,
        it retains the nuance of being 'speaking of' or 'when it comes to' that topic.
      grammar_point: 何といっても (unquestionably)
  post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing these expressions, remember that 「といえば・と言うと・と言ったら」 introduce
    a topic that is naturally related to something previously mentioned, or highlight a typical example
    or strong reaction concerning that topic. In contrast, 「そういえば」 introduces a thought that suddenly occurred
    to the speaker, and 「ところで」 signals a complete change of subject. 「は」 simply marks a topic without the
    specific connective or emphatic nuance. 「って」 is a more casual way to mark a topic, lacking the conditional
    or emphatic sense. 「について」 merely states what is being discussed without the 'speaking of' nuance. 「たとえば」
    is a direct way to give an example, distinct from 「といえば」's associative function. 「何といっても」 emphasizes
    a point but lacks the conversational linking aspect.
  examples:
    - english: Yesterday's sports match was awesome, right! Speaking of soccer, do you know that Yamada
        just scored a new goal?
      japanese:
        - 昨日 の スポーツ の 試合、最高 だっ た ね！サッカー {と いえ ば}、山田 選手 が 新しい ゴール を 決め た の 知っ てる？
        - 昨日 の スポーツ の 試合、最高 だっ た ね！サッカー {と いえ ば}、山田 選手 が 新しい ゴール を 決め た の、知っ てる？
        - 昨日 の スポーツ の 試合、最高 だっ た ね！サッカー {と いえ ば}、山田 選手、また 新 ゴール を 決め た みたい だ よ？
      english_literally: Yesterday's sports match, it was the best, right! Speaking of soccer, Yamada player
        scored a new goal, do you know?

        - competing_japanese:
            - サッカー {は}、山田 選手 が 新しい ゴール を 決め た の 知っ てる？
          english: As for soccer, do you know that Yamada just scored a new goal?
          hint: Using 「は」 would simply state soccer as the topic. We're looking for a phrase that links
            the new topic (soccer) to the previous conversation about sports, conveying 'speaking of' or
            'that reminds me of'.
      scene: Two friends catching up on recent sports events. One is enthusiastic about a recent match,
        leading the other to bring up related news.
      register: casual
      setting: friendly
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: male
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: The casual 「最高だったね！」 (was awesome, right!) and 「知ってる？」 (do you know?) indicate a friendly,
        casual conversation between peers. The choice of 「サッカー」 as a noun followed by 「といえば」 shows the natural
        shift in topic within a broader discussion about sports.
      etymology: 'The use of 「ね」 at the end of a sentence often seeks agreement or empathy from the listener,
        derived from older forms of rhetorical questions. 「最高」 combines 「最」 (sa: utmost) and 「高」 (taka:
        high), literally ''highest'' or ''supreme''. 「選手」 combines 「選」 (sen: select) and 「手」 (shu: hand,
        person), meaning a chosen player.'
    - english: Speaking of Sato-san, I heard she returned from overseas last week, didn't I?
      japanese:
        - 佐藤 さん {と いう と}、確か、先週 海外 から 帰国 し たって 聞き まし た けど。
        - 佐藤 さん {と いう と}、先週 海外 から お 帰り に なっ た と か。

          english: As for Sato-san, if I'm not mistaken, I heard she returned from overseas last week.
          hint: Using 「は」 would simply state Sato-san as the topic. We need a phrase that suggests a thought
            or information comes to mind because Sato-san was mentioned.
      scene: Colleagues discussing a mutual acquaintance, Sato-san, whose name has just been mentioned.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: informative
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: group
      speaker_age: older
      nuance: The use of 「佐藤さん」 and polite verb endings like 「聞きました」 maintain a semi-formal, office-appropriate
        tone. 「確か」 indicates a slight uncertainty but a strong recollection of the information.
      etymology: '「帰国」 (kikoku) is a compound noun formed from 「帰る」 (kaeru: to return) and 「国」 (koku: country),
        literally ''return to country''. 「〜って」 is a casual contraction of 「〜と 言う」, indicating reported speech.'
    - english: If we're talking about tourist spots, Kyoto is the first that comes to mind, isn't it?

          english: If it's about tourist spots, Kyoto is the first that comes to mind, isn't it?
          hint: 「なら」 is a conditional marker, indicating 'if that's the case.' We need a phrase that introduces
            a prominent or typical example related to the topic.
      scene: Planning a trip with friends and brainstorming potential destinations in Japan.
      register: teineigo (polite)
      setting: pessimistic
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: group
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: The polite 「〜ますね」 and 「浮かびますね」 convey a respectful and agreeable tone suitable for a group
        setting. The phrase 「一番に浮かびます」 is a common way to express that something is the first thing that
        comes to mind when a topic is raised.
      etymology: '「観光地」 (kankouchi) is a compound of 「観光」 (kankou: sightseeing) and 「地」 (chi: place), directly
        meaning ''sighting place''. 「浮かぶ」 (ukabu) originally means ''to float'' or ''to surface'', and metaphorically
        ''to come to mind'', as if ideas surface from within.'
    - english: When it comes to how I spend my holidays, reading is definitely the most relaxing.
      japanese:

          english: Regarding how I spend my holidays, reading is definitely the most relaxing.
          hint: 「について」 simply means 'regarding' or 'about.' We're looking for a phrase that emphasizes a
            definitive characteristic or preference related to the topic.
      scene: A person reflecting on their preferred way to relax during time off.

      setting: reflective
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: no one
      speaker_age: older
      nuance: The use of 「やっぱり」 (as expected, after all) adds emphasis to the speaker's confirmed preference.
        The polite 「落ち着きます」 (feel calm/relaxed) indicates a gentle, personal reflection, suitable for speaking
        aloud to oneself.
      etymology: '「休日」 (kyuujitsu) combines 「休」 (kyuu: rest) and 「日」 (jitsu: day), meaning ''day off''.
        「過ごし方」 (sugoshikata) is formed from the verb 「過ごす」 (sugosu: to spend time) and 「方」 (kata: way, manner).'

          english: As for the new app, have you already downloaded and tried it?
          hint: 「は」 marks the topic. We need a phrase that explicitly links the new topic (the app) to a
            preceding general discussion, implying 'speaking of that...'.
      scene: Two colleagues discussing recent tech news or updates.
      register: formal
      setting: professional
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: female
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: The formal 「〜ましたか？」 and the general topic of '新しいアプリ' (new app) are suitable for a professional
        conversation, perhaps between colleagues. The structure implies a natural progression from a shared
        topic of awareness to a specific action related to it.

        - competing_japanese:
            - あの 難しい 試験 {は}、ほとんど の 人 が 落ち たって 聞い た よ。
          english: As for that difficult exam, I heard almost everyone failed.
          hint: 「は」 simply states the topic. We need a phrase that explicitly brings up a specific point
            or outcome related to a previously mentioned topic, often with a sense of 'it reminds me of'.
      scene: Two students discussing a recent, challenging exam after receiving their results.
      register: casual
      setting: serious
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: female
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: The use of 「あの難しい試験」 (that difficult exam) refers to a shared, negative experience. 「ほとんどの人が落ちたって聞いたよ」
        (I heard almost everyone failed) highlights the common struggle, conveying a sense of commiseration.
      etymology: '「試験」 (shiken) is formed from 「試」 (shi: test) and 「験」 (ken: examine), meaning ''exam''.
        「落ちる」 (ochiru) means ''to fall'' or ''to fail'', colloquially used for failing an exam. The casual
        「〜って聞いたよ」 indicates reported information in a friendly manner.'
  post_example_writeup: Notice how each example uses one of the three forms (～といえば, ～と言うと, ～と言ったら) to naturally
    transition between topics or to introduce a specific, related point. The choice between them often depends
    on the exact nuance of connection or emphasis you wish to convey, ranging from a general association
    to a strong reaction or a definitive example. Pay attention to the register and setting, as these forms
    are quite versatile and can be used in both casual and formal contexts, adapting to the politeness level
    of the rest of the sentence.

  pronunciation:
    katakana: トイエバ
    romaji: to ieba
  formation:
    '[Topic] + と 言え ば': Used to introduce a related topic or to recall something upon hearing a certain
      word or phrase.
  jlpt: N3
  details:
    part-of-speech: phrase
    register: casual
    usage-context: Used to bring up a related topic or something that you recall upon hearing a particular
      word or phrase. It can express a casual connection or a spontaneous thought triggered by the previous
      statement.
    nuance: Implies that the speaker is reminded of something or wants to switch the topic to something
      related.
  etymology: 「と言う (to iu)」 meaning "to say" and 「ば (ba)」, the conditional particle. Literally, it means
    "if you say," indicating that the topic is being introduced based on what was just mentioned.
  writeup: 「と言えば (to ieba)」 literally means "if you say that..." but functions as an an expression to introduce
    a topic related to what was just mentioned. It's similar to saying "speaking of..." in English. It indicates
    that the speaker is reminded of something or wants to shift the conversation to a connected topic, often
    triggered by the previous speaker's words. This phrase is typically used in conversational settings,
    allowing for a smooth and natural transition between subjects.
  false_friends:
    - term: ～って
      meaning: casual topic marker; as for X; speaking of X
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「～って」 is a more direct and often abrupt way to introduce or refer to a topic in casual speech,
        sometimes implying a quick reaction or summary. It lacks the smooth, reflective, 'being reminded
        of' nuance of 「と言えば」.
      grammar_point: って (casual topic marker)
    - term: ～ったら
      meaning: exclamatory topic marker; used to express surprise, exasperation, or strong emphasis regarding
        the topic
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While 「～ったら」 can mark a topic, it carries a strong emotional tone (surprise, exasperation,
        admiration) that 「と言えば」 does not. 「と言えば」 is neutral and primarily functions as a topic shifter.
      grammar_point: ったら・といったら (extreme degree)
    - term: と言うと
      meaning: when it comes to X; speaking of X (often implies further explanation or definition of X)
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「と言うと」 often implies that the speaker is about to elaborate on or define the mentioned topic,
        or to present a representative example. 「と言えば」 is more about simply being reminded of something
        by the mention of the topic, leading to a related but not necessarily explanatory discussion.
      grammar_point: と言えば・と言うと・と言ったら (speaking of)
    - term: と言っても
      meaning: although one says X; even if one says X; having said that
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「と言っても」 is used to present a counterpoint or a limiting condition to what was just stated,
        often correcting a potential misunderstanding or providing a more realistic perspective. 「と言えば」,
        on the other hand, is purely for topic shifting and doesn't involve contradiction or limitation.
      grammar_point: と言っても (having said that)
    - term: 〜のことだが
      meaning: regarding X; concerning X
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「〜のことだが」 is a more direct and intentional way to introduce a topic for discussion or inquiry,
        often preceding an important point. It signifies a conscious shift to discuss X, rather than being
        spontaneously reminded of X by a previous statement.
      grammar_point: のこと (about・concerning)
  post_false_friends_writeup: While expressions like 「～って」, 「～ったら」, 「と言うと」, 「と言っても」, and 「〜のことだが」 all involve
    discussing a topic, they carry distinct nuances. 「と言えば」 specifically signals that the speaker has been
    reminded of something by the preceding comment and wishes to introduce that related thought. It is a
    neutral and common conversational bridge. The other expressions each carry a different emotional tone,
    a specific purpose (like explanation or contradiction), or a higher degree of informality, and thus
    are not interchangeable with 「と言えば」 for simple topic transitions.

          english: My dog loves playing in the park (exclamation about dogs).
          hint: 「～って」 often carries a more exclamatory or direct response nuance, lacking the smooth, reflective
            transition of 「と言えば」. We're looking for a smooth topic shift.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 犬 {と いう と}、うち の 子 は 公園 で 遊ぶ の が 大好き な ん です。
          english: When it comes to dogs, my dog loves playing in the park (explanatory).
          hint: 「～というと」 typically implies an explanation or definition is forthcoming, rather than a spontaneous
            recollection. We're looking for a natural transition of thought.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 犬 {だっ たら}、うち の 子 は 公園 で 遊ぶ の が 大好き な ん です。
          english: If it's about dogs, my dog loves playing in the park.
          hint: 「～だったら」 is a conditional meaning 'if it is X', implying a specific condition or choice.

            - 犬 {の こと です が}、うち の 子 は 公園 で 遊ぶ の が 大好き な ん です。
          english: Regarding dogs, my dog loves playing in the park.
          hint: 「～のことですが」 is more formal and introduces a topic directly, without the implied 'reminded
            of' nuance. We're looking for a spontaneous topic shift.
      scene: You and a friend are casually chatting about pets, and you want to share a detail about your
        own dog.
      register: casual
      setting: friendly
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: male
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: The use of 「うちの子」 (uchi no ko) is an affectionate way to refer to one's pet, common among
        female speakers. The ending 「んです」 (n desu) adds a soft, explanatory nuance, suitable for a friendly
        conversation. 「大好きなんです」 sounds quite natural for a female speaker expressing affection.

          english: When it comes to homework, have you finished it all?

            - 宿題 {だっ たら}、もう 全部 終わら せ た？
          english: If it's about homework, have you finished it all?
          hint: 「～だったら」 sets a conditional context. We're looking for a phrase that simply means 'speaking

          english: How was last week's concert (asking generally)?
          hint: This phrase is a direct question about the concert's quality. We're looking for a phrase
            that spontaneously brings up a specific detail about the concert.
      scene: Two friends who attended a concert together are chatting about it a week later, and one brings
        up a specific highlight.
      register: casual
      setting: friendly
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: female
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: The casual ending 「すごかったよね？」 (sugokatta yo ne?) is a natural way to share an impression and
        seek agreement among friends. This shows how 「と言えば」 is used to bring up a specific memory or impression
        related to a previous topic.
    - english: Speaking of Japanese food, my favorite is sushi.
      japanese:
        - 日本 食 {と 言え ば}、私 は 寿司 が 一番 好き です。

        - 日本 食 {と 言え ば}、俺 は 寿司 が ダントツ で 好き だ な。

      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 日本 食 {の こと です が}、私 は 寿司 が 一番 好き です。
          english: Regarding Japanese food, my favorite is sushi.
          hint: 「～のことですが」 is more formal and introduces a topic for discussion, lacking the spontaneous
            'reminded' feeling of 「と言えば」. We're looking for a natural conversational pivot.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 日本 食 {って}、寿司 が 一番 好き だ よ ね。
          english: Japanese food (exclamation), sushi is my favorite, right?
          hint: 「～って」 can be too direct or exclamatory for a simple statement of preference. We're looking
            for a smooth, conversational transition.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 日本 食 {と いう と}、寿司 が 一番 です ね。
          english: When it comes to Japanese food, sushi is the best, right?
          hint: 「～というと」 often sets up an explanation or definition, not just a casual statement of preference.
            We're looking for a simple, 'speaking of X' type of transition.
      scene: You and a friend are discussing different cuisines, and the topic of Japanese food comes up,
        prompting you to state your preference.
      register: casual
      setting: informative
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: female
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: The phrase 「やっぱり」 (yappari) adds a nuance of 'as expected' or 'of course,' indicating a firm
        and perhaps long-held preference. The use of 「俺」 (ore) by the male speaker is typical in casual
        conversation among friends. This usage is common for expressing personal opinions when a topic arises
        naturally.
    - english: Speaking of your mother, how is she doing lately?
      japanese:
        - お 母 さん {と 言え ば}、最近 どう です か？

      competing_grammar:

            - お 母 さん {の こと です が}、最近 どう です か？
          english: Regarding your mother, how is she doing lately?
          hint: 「～のことですが」 is a more direct and formal way to bring up a topic, lacking the spontaneous 'reminded
            by' nuance of 「と言えば」. We're looking for a more natural conversational shift.
        - competing_japanese:
            - お 母 さん {って}、最近 どう です か？
          english: Your mother (exclamation), how is she doing lately?
          hint: 「～って」 can be too abrupt or informal when asking about someone's family member, especially
            if you're not very close. We're looking for a polite, smooth transition.
      scene: You are talking to a friend or acquaintance, and their mother is mentioned, prompting you to
        ask about her well-being.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: interrogative
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: male
      speaker_age: older
      nuance: The use of 「お母様」 (okaa-sama) and 「いかがでございますか」 (ikaga de gozaimasu ka) demonstrates a very
        polite, honorific register, suitable for addressing someone with respect, perhaps in a more formal
        or business context, or when speaking about another's parent. This shows the flexibility of 「と言えば」
        across registers.
    - english: Speaking of pizza, which toppings do you like the most?
      japanese:
        - ピザ {と 言え ば}、何 の トッピング が 一番 好き？

          english: Pizza (exclamation), what toppings do you like the most?
          hint: 「～って」 is often too abrupt and lacks the casual conversational flow of being reminded of
            something. We're looking for a phrase that smoothly shifts the topic.
        - competing_japanese:
            - ピザ {の こと です が}、何 の トッピング が 一番 好き です か？
          english: Regarding pizza, what toppings do you like the most?
          hint: 「～のことですが」 is a direct way to introduce a topic, not conveying the nuance of being spontaneously
            reminded by a previous comment. We're looking for a phrase for a natural topic shift.
        - competing_japanese:
            - ピザ {と いう と}、何 の トッピング が 一番 好き です か？
          english: When it comes to pizza, what toppings do you like the most?
          hint: 「～というと」 often implies a more in-depth discussion or definition of the topic. We're looking
            for a simple, 'speaking of X' type of transition.
      scene: Two friends are deciding what to order for dinner, and pizza is mentioned, prompting a question
        about preferences.
      register: casual
      setting: friendly
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: female
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: The informal 「何」 (nani) for "what" and the direct question ending 「好き？」 (suki?) are typical
        of casual conversations between friends. This example shows 「と言えば」 being used to naturally pivot
        to a related, personal inquiry.
  post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「と言えば」 acts as a natural conversational connector, allowing
    speakers to spontaneously introduce related thoughts or questions based on something that was just mentioned.
    It maintains a neutral tone and is highly versatile across various registers, from casual chat among
    friends to more formal professional inquiries. This phrase is a staple in natural Japanese conversation,
    facilitating smooth transitions between topics.

  id: gp0812
  meaning: Speaking of; when you say; if you mention; which reminds me of
  pronunciation:
    katakana: トイウト
    romaji: to iu to
  formation:
    Noun + と言うと: Used when a noun is mentioned, and it triggers a specific association or thought.
    Sentence (casual form) + と言うと: Used when a statement is made, and it leads to a particular consequence
      or reaction.
  jlpt: N3
  details:
    part-of-speech: phrase
    register: semi-formal
    function: Expresses an immediate, often involuntary, association or reaction to a mentioned topic or
      situation
  etymology: 「と言う」 (to say) + 「と」 (conditional particle) + 「言う」 (to say) + 「と」 (conjunction). Literally,
    it suggests 'if you say... then...' emphasizing the immediate association or consequence that arises
    upon mentioning something.
  writeup: 「と言うと」 is a versatile phrase used to express what comes to mind or what association arises when
    a particular noun or situation is mentioned. It functions similarly to saying "speaking of..." or "when
    you say...". It indicates an immediate and often involuntary connection between the topic and the associated
    thought or image. This connection can be a memory, a typical characteristic, a stereotype, or even a
    reaction. It can also be used to introduce a situation and its typical consequence, or to highlight
    how a statement might be perceived, sometimes ironically.
  false_friends:
    - term: と言えば
      meaning: Speaking of; if you mention; reminds me of
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「と言えば」 often introduces a related topic or elaborates on something mentioned. It implies a
        deliberate shift or expansion of the conversation, whereas 「と言うと」 focuses on an immediate, often
        involuntary association, typical outcome, or the perception created by something.
      grammar_point: と言えば・と言うと・と言ったら (speaking of)
    - term: となると
      meaning: If it comes to (the point where); when it comes to (that situation)
      kind: often confused with
      nuance: 「となると」 implies a logical conclusion or a shift in state based on a preceding situation or
        fact. It leads to a consequence or deduction. In contrast, 「と言うと」 is about an immediate association,
        a typical reaction, or how something is generally perceived when it's mentioned.
      grammar_point: となると (when it comes to)
    - term: と来たら
      meaning: When it comes to..., Concerning...
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「と来たら」 often expresses a slightly negative or exasperated tone when referring to someone or
        something's typical behavior or characteristic. While 「と言うと」 can describe a general perception,
        「と来たら」 carries more judgment, often implying a complaint.

    - term: と言ったら
      meaning: When it comes to; as for (often implying surprise or extremity)
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「と言ったら」 often emphasizes the surprising or extreme nature of something related to the topic,
        or introduces something notable about it. It can carry a more emotional or emphatic tone than 「と言うと」.
        「と言うと」 focuses on the typical association or immediate reaction to a mention, whereas 「と言ったら」 focuses
        on the degree or impact of the thing itself.
      grammar_point: ったら・といったら (extreme degree)
  post_false_friends_writeup: The key difference lies in the nuance of the connection being made. 「と言うと」
    highlights an immediate, often involuntary association or a typical consequence, often leading to a
    specific reaction or common thought upon hearing a word or phrase. 「と言えば」, on the other hand, often
    serves to introduce a related topic or shift the conversation, suggesting a broader connection to the
    previous discussion rather than a direct, instantaneous mental link. 「となると」 signifies a logical progression
    or deduction from a given circumstance, focusing on what logically follows if a certain condition is
    met or situation arises. Meanwhile, 「と言ったら」 often emphasizes the surprising or extreme nature of something
    related to the mentioned topic, conveying a strong emotional or emphatic tone. Lastly, 「と来たら」 typically
    introduces a person or thing that is the subject of complaint or exasperation, highlighting a characteristic
    behavior often viewed negatively.

      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:

          english: Speaking of Mount Fuji, it is a symbol of Japan, as everyone would probably think.
          hint: 「と言えば」 often introduces a broader topic or elaboration related to the prior mention, rather
            than an immediate, direct association. We're looking for an immediate association with Mount
            Fuji.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 富士 山 {と なる と}、日本 の 象徴 だ と 誰 も が 思う だろう。
          english: If it comes to Mount Fuji, then everyone would probably think it's a symbol of Japan.
          hint: 「となると」 implies a logical consequence or a new situation arising from the mention. We're
            looking for an immediate, intuitive association or thought that comes to mind upon hearing 'Mount
            Fuji'.
      scene: Discussing famous landmarks with friends.
      register: casual
      setting: friendly
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: group
      nuance: This sentence expresses a common, almost universal association that arises when the topic
        of Mount Fuji is brought up. The use of 「誰もが思うだろう」 reinforces this widely held, immediate thought.
    - english: When I mentioned that we're going on a trip this weekend, the children jumped up and down
        with joy.

          english: Since we're going on a trip this weekend, the children jumped up and down with joy.
          hint: This implies a direct causal relationship. 「と言うと」 highlights the announcement as the trigger
            for their sudden, enthusiastic reaction, rather than just the reason for their joy. The scene
            emphasizes the sudden, immediate reaction to the news being delivered.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 週末 に 旅行 に 行く {と}、子供 たち は 跳びはね て 喜ん だ。
          english: If we go on a trip this weekend, the children jump up and down with joy.
          hint: This conditional implies that *if* they go, the kids will be happy, or it describes a regular
            occurrence. The scene specifies it as a one-time announcement and the immediate, enthusiastic
            reaction to it.

          english: Speaking of going on a trip this weekend, the children jumped up and down with joy.
          hint: 「と言えば」 would mean 'speaking of going on a trip'. Here, the speaker's statement *triggered*
            the children's immediate reaction. We're looking for a grammar point that shows an immediate
            consequence of a statement.

          hint: 「となると」 implies a logical consequence if a certain situation arises. Here, the action is
            an immediate reaction to the *act of saying* something. We are looking for the direct result
            of a verbal announcement.

      register: casual
      setting: excited
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: group
      nuance: The phrase 「跳びはねて喜んだ」 vividly describes the children's immediate and enthusiastic reaction.
        The context of a parent speaking to children makes the casual register natural.

          english: Since I'm quitting my job, the section chief fell silent.
          hint: This focuses on the reason for his response. 「と言うと」 focuses on the *act of saying it* as
            the specific trigger for his specific, surprised reaction. The scene implies a direct, impactful
            utterance leading to an immediate response.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 仕事 を 辞める {と}、部長 は 黙り込ん だ。
          english: If I quit my job, the section chief falls silent.

            - 仕事 を 辞める {と 言え ば}、部長 は 黙り込ん だ。
          english: Speaking of quitting my job, the section chief fell silent.
          hint: 「と言えば」 introduces a related topic. Here, the speaker's announcement *caused* the chief's
            immediate silence. We need a grammar point that shows a direct, immediate reaction to a statement.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 仕事 を 辞める {と なる と}、部長 は 黙り込ん だ。
          english: If it comes to quitting my job, the section chief fell silent.
          hint: 「となると」 implies a logical consequence or a shift in circumstances. Here, the action is an
            immediate reaction to the *act of saying* the words. We are looking for the direct result of
            a verbal announcement.
      scene: An employee informing their boss of their resignation.
      register: formal
      setting: serious
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: male
      nuance: The direct statement 「仕事は辞めます」 from a male speaker to his male boss sets a formal and serious
        tone. The resulting 「黙り込んだ」 (fell silent) indicates an immediate, perhaps uncomfortable or surprised,
        reaction triggered by the impactful news.

          english: If she has studied abroad, she sounds impressive.
          hint: This conditional suggests a hypothetical impression. 「と言うと」 refers to the actual utterance
            and the impression it creates, then contrasts it with reality. The scene involves an informal
            discussion where the speaker clarifies a perception about someone and the impact of her statement.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼女 が 留学 経験 が ある {そう だ}。
          english: It seems she has studied abroad.
          hint: This simply states that 'it seems she has studied abroad'. 「と言うと」 emphasizes the *effect*
            of her statement, specifically how 'impressive' it sounds.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼女 は 留学 経験 が ある {と 言え ば}、優秀 に 聞こえる が、実 は 一 年 だけ だっ た。
          english: Speaking of her having studied abroad, it sounds impressive, but in reality, it was only
            for one year.
          hint: 「と言えば」 introduces a related point. Here, we're talking about the *impression* created when

      scene: Friends discussing a mutual acquaintance's background.
      register: casual
      setting: informative

      listener_gender: female
      nuance: The nuance of 「優秀に聞こえるが、実は…」 indicates that the statement 「留学経験がある」 *sounds* good or impressive,
        but the actual truth is less substantial. This highlights the gap between the perception created
        by the statement and the reality.

          english: Anime originated in Japan.
          hint: This is a simple declarative sentence stating a fact. 「と言うと」 adds the nuance of "when the
            word 'anime' is mentioned, this is the immediate and widely held association and acknowledgment."
            The scene requires a statement that prompts a general, universally accepted consensus.
        - competing_japanese:
            - アニメ に つい て {言え ば}、日本 発祥 だ。
          english: Speaking of anime, it originated in Japan.
          hint: This introduces a broader topic. 「と言うと」 is more about the immediate, involuntary association
            or understanding that arises from the mention of the word itself.
        - competing_japanese:
            - アニメ {と 言え ば}、日本 発祥 だ と 誰 も が 認める だろう。
          english: Speaking of anime, everyone would acknowledge its origin in Japan.
          hint: While similar, 「と言えば」 might introduce a wider range of topics related to anime. 「と言うと」 specifically
            highlights that the *immediate* and strong association that comes to mind as soon as 'anime'
            is mentioned. We're looking for that direct, widely accepted link.

            - アニメ {と なる と}、日本 発祥 だ と 誰 も が 認める だろう。
          english: If it comes to anime, everyone would acknowledge its origin in Japan.
          hint: 「となると」 implies a logical deduction or a new condition. Here, we're talking about a generally
            known and immediate association that pops into mind when 'anime' is mentioned. We're looking
            for an immediate association, not a logical deduction.
      scene: A presenter giving a talk on global cultural influences.
      register: formal
      setting: academic
      nuance: This example uses a formal, assertive tone suitable for an academic setting, implying a widely
        accepted truth. 「誰もが認めるだろう」 reinforces this general consensus linked to the mention of anime. It
        presents a common knowledge point triggered by the subject.

          english: If he likes Italian cuisine, he passionately talks about Neapolitan pizza.
          hint: This is a conditional statement. 「と言うと」 implies that the mere mention of Italian food *triggers*
            his passion for Neapolitan pizza, suggesting an automatic, almost involuntary association. The
            scene depicts a recurring, almost habitual reaction to a specific topic.

          english: Speaking of Italian cuisine, he always passionately talks about Neapolitan pizza.

            that the *mention* of Italian cuisine immediately and consistently triggers his passionate discourse
            on Neapolitan pizza. We need the immediate, habitual reaction to the specific topic being brought
            up.
        - competing_japanese:

        the passionate and perhaps overly specific focus of his discussion when the topic of Italian food
        comes up, indicating a strong, immediate association.
    - english: When you mention summer, I immediately think of the intense heat.
      japanese:

          english: When it's summer, it's hot.
          hint: This is a general statement about summer being hot. 「と言うと」 captures the immediate, often
            visceral, memory or association that comes to mind upon hearing the word 'summer', specifically
            the intensity of the heat.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 夏 {の こと な ら}、あの 猛烈 な 暑 さ だ。
          english: If it's about summer, it's that intense heat.
          hint: This rephrasing sounds a bit awkward. 「と言うと」 effectively conveys the automatic mental connection
            between 'summer' and 'intense heat' as a strong association.
      scene: Someone complaining about the weather during a cool day, remembering the previous summer.
      register: casual
      setting: melancholic
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: group
      nuance: This example uses 「思い出す」 to emphasize the involuntary nature of the memory or association
        that immediately springs to mind when 'summer' is mentioned, specifically focusing on its most prominent,
        often negative, characteristic – the intense heat. The use of 「あの」 also adds a sense of personal
        experience or shared understanding of that specific heat.

          hint: This states a fact about samurai. 「と言うと」 describes the common perception or image that arises

            - 侍 {と いえ ば}、強く 寡黙 な 戦士 の イメージ だ。
          english: Speaking of samurai, it's the image of a strong, stoic warrior.
          hint: 「と言えば」 can also introduce an image, but 「と言うと」 more strongly emphasizes the *immediate*
            and widespread mental picture evoked by the term itself.
      scene: A history professor giving a lecture on Japanese culture.
      register: formal
      setting: academic
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: group
      nuance: This example highlights a common, almost stereotypical image associated with a noun. 「多く の
        人 は」 and 「想像 する」 reinforce the idea of a widely shared mental picture that is immediately conjured
        when the word 「侍」 is uttered, suitable for an academic context discussing cultural perceptions.
    - english: When I told him I was leaving the company, he just calmly said, 'Is that so?'

          english: Since I said I was leaving the company, he calmly said, 'Is that so?'
          hint: This focuses on the reason for his response. 「と言うと」 emphasizes the *act of saying* the words
            as the immediate trigger for his specific, perhaps unexpected, reaction. We are looking for
            the direct, immediate result of a verbal announcement.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 会社 を 辞める {と 言え ば}、彼 は 淡々 と『そう です か』と 言っ た。
          english: Speaking of saying I was leaving the company, he just calmly said, 'Is that so?'
          hint: 「と言えば」 introduces a related topic. Here, the unexpected reaction is directly triggered by
            the announcement itself. We need to show the immediate consequence of the statement.
      scene: An employee informing their colleague or manager about their resignation, expecting a different
        reaction.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: serious
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: male
      nuance: This example uses the sentence as the trigger for an immediate reaction, focusing on the *unexpected
        calmness* of the listener's response. The phrase 「淡々と」 emphasizes this surprising lack of emotion.
        It highlights the direct, often impactful, consequence of a spoken declaration.
    - english: When someone speaks so formally, it often gives the impression that they are a little stiff.
      japanese:
        - あんな に 丁寧 に 話す {と 言う と}、少し 硬い 印象 を 与える こと が ある。

          english: If someone speaks so politely, it gives a slightly stiff impression.
          hint: This is a general conditional statement. 「と言うと」 is used to describe the *typical impression*
            or judgment that arises when one hears someone speak in such a manner. We're looking for the
            immediate perception formed from an observation.
        - competing_japanese:
            - あんな に 丁寧 に 話す {と なる と}、少し 硬い 印象 を 与える こと が ある。
          english: If it comes to speaking so politely, it can give a slightly stiff impression.
          hint: 「となると」 implies a logical conclusion or a shift in context. Here, it's about the general
            impression formed from hearing someone speak a certain way, an immediate judgment, not a logical
            deduction.
      scene: Two colleagues discussing a new team member's communication style.
      register: casual
      setting: reflective
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: This example showcases 「と言うと」 being used to express a general observation or impression formed
        immediately upon encountering a certain behavior or characteristic. 「少し硬い印象を与えることがある」 indicates
        that this perception is not absolute but commonly arises. It reflects a nuanced judgment based on
        someone's manner of speaking.
    - english: When you mention Kyoto, the first thing that comes to mind is its beautiful temples and traditional
        gardens.

            - 京都 {と いえ ば}、美しい お 寺 や 伝統 的 な 庭園 だ。
          english: Speaking of Kyoto, it's its beautiful temples and traditional gardens.
          hint: While similar, 「と言えば」 might introduce a broader range of topics. 「と言うと」 emphasizes the immediate,
            almost automatic association that comes to mind when Kyoto is mentioned. We're looking for the
            very first thing that pops into one's head.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 京都 は 美しい お 寺 や 伝統 的 な 庭園 が {ある}。
          english: Kyoto has beautiful temples and traditional gardens.

            that is immediately evoked upon hearing the word 'Kyoto'.
      scene: A travel agent talking to a client about popular tourist destinations.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: informative
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: group
      nuance: This sentence illustrates how 「と言うと」 can introduce the most prominent or iconic association
        with a place. 「まず」 (first) and 「頭に浮かぶ」 (comes to mind) emphasize the immediacy and strength of this
        connection, highlighting the direct mental link upon hearing 'Kyoto'.
  post_example_writeup: 「と言うと」 is most often used to highlight an immediate, often involuntary, association
    or reaction to a topic. It can describe what naturally comes to mind, or how a statement is typically
    perceived, sometimes with a nuance of irony or overstatement. The phrase sets up an expectation based
    on the initial mention, which can then be fulfilled or contradicted. It effectively conveys the direct
    impact or mental trigger caused by a noun or a statement.
