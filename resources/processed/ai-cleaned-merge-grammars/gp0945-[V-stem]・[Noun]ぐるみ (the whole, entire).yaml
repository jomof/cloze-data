  part-of-speech: suffix
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to describe collective action or involvement where an entire group or entity participates
    as a single unit.
  function: Expresses comprehensiveness, totality, or collective participation of a group or organization.
  nuance: Implies that the entire specified unit (e.g., family, company, town) is involved, often suggesting
    shared responsibility, effort, or experience. It's stronger than simply 'all members' as it emphasizes
    the unit acting as a whole.
  colocation: Commonly used with nouns referring to groups or organizations such as 家族 (kazoku), 町 (machi),
    会社 (kaisha), 国 (kuni), チーム (chīmu), 組織 (soshiki).
  grammatical-role: Acts as an adverbial modifier, modifying the verb or the overall action of the sentence.
etymology: The suffix 『ぐるみ』 is believed to be derived from the verb 『くるむ』 (kurumu), meaning "to wrap"
  or "to envelop". This etymological root clearly reflects its meaning of encompassing or including an
  entire group or entity, as if 'wrapped together' in an action or situation. It signifies a comprehensive
  involvement, where nothing within the specified scope is left out.
writeup: |-
  『ぐるみ』 is a suffix that expresses the involvement or scope of an entire group or entity. It is almost exclusively attached to nouns, indicating that the 'whole' of that noun is involved in an action or state. This grammatical pattern highlights collective participation, shared responsibility, or a comprehensive reach within a defined unit.

  For example, 『家族ぐるみ』 (kazoku gurumi) means 'the whole family' or 'family-wide,' suggesting that all family members are participating together. Similarly, 『町ぐるみ』 (machi gurumi) means 'the whole town' or 'town-wide,' implying a collective effort or characteristic that extends throughout the entire town.

  It is important to note that while the grammar point name includes 『V-stem・ぐるみ』, this usage is not standard in modern Japanese. 『ぐるみ』 is predominantly used with nouns to convey the sense of 'including the entire entity' or 'the whole of something' acting collectively.

  This grammar point emphasizes the idea of a unit acting as one, rather than simply a collection of individuals. It often carries a nuance of thoroughness or a unified front, making it suitable for describing events, initiatives, or characteristics that involve every part of a defined group.

  - term: すべて
    meaning: All, every.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 『すべて』 is a general term for 'all' or 'everything', referring to discrete items or the totality
      of things. 『ぐるみ』, however, specifically implies the comprehensive involvement of an entire *unit*
      or *group* acting collectively as a single entity, often with a sense of shared action or experience.
      For example, 『家族すべて』 would mean every single family member, while 『家族ぐるみ』 implies the family acting
      as a unified body.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:すべて (all・every)
  - term: 全部
    meaning: All, entire (of a specific collection).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 『すべて』, 『全部』 refers to the entirety of a collection of items. 『ぐるみ』 focuses on the
      collective involvement or comprehensive scope of a single *entity* or *group*, often implying a
      joint effort or shared experience among its members.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:全部 (all・entire)
  - term: を挙げて
    meaning: With all efforts; wholehearted; mobilizing the entire [group].
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 『を挙げて』 often implies a strong, concerted effort or mobilization by the entire group towards
      a specific goal. While 『ぐるみ』 also implies collective involvement, 『を挙げて』 emphasizes the *action*
      and *effort* of the group, whereas 『ぐるみ』 emphasizes the *scope* of involvement, indicating that
      the entire unit is participating or characterized in a certain way. They are very close in meaning
      and can sometimes be interchangeable, but 『ぐるみ』 leans more towards inclusive participation, and
      『を挙げて』 leans more towards unified effort.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:を挙げて (with all efforts・wholehearted)
  - term: 一同
    meaning: All members present; the whole company/group.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 『一同』 refers to all individuals within a defined group, often used when addressing them or
      referring to them as a collection of people (e.g., 『社員一同』 - all employees). 『ぐるみ』, in contrast,
      refers to the group *as a whole unit* participating in an activity or embodying a characteristic,
      focusing on the collective aspect rather than just the summation of its members.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:一同 (all people)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing 『ぐるみ』 from similar terms like 『すべて』, 『全部』, 『を挙げて』, or
  『一同』, remember that 『ぐるみ』 emphasizes the *collective participation of an entire unit or group* acting
  as a unified body. It often implies a shared experience, joint effort, or comprehensive characteristic
  that extends throughout the whole entity, rather than just a simple count of all members or a general
  sense of totality.
