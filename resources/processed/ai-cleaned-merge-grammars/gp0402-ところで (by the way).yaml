pronunciation:
  katakana: トコロデ

formation:
  ところで: Used at the beginning of a sentence to introduce a new topic, similar to "by the way" or "incidentally."
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: conjunction
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: General
  function: To abruptly change the topic of conversation.
  nuance: Implies that something in the previous topic subtly reminded the speaker of an unrelated matter.
  temporal-flow: Signifies a temporal and thematic disjunction from the previous statement to introduce
    a new subject.
  spatial-flow: Metaphorically shifts the conversational 'space' to an entirely different area. Other
    spatial details are not applicable. Similar to how 'in passing' or 'incidentally' allows a speaker
    to move to a new conceptual space. Other spatial details are not applicable.
etymology: 「ところで」 is composed of 「所 (tokoro)」 meaning "place" or "point," and the particle 「で (de)」, indicating
  location or means. The phrase literally means "at the point," but its usage evolved to signify a shift
  in the conversation to another 'point' or topic.
writeup: 「ところで」 is a conjunction formed from the noun 「所 (tokoro)」, meaning "place" or "point," and the
  particle 「で (de)」. Its literal translation is closer to 'and with that'. It functions similarly to "by
  the way" or "incidentally" in English, serving to introduce a completely new topic in a conversation.
  It signals a clear shift from the current subject to something entirely unrelated. The nuance conveyed
  is that something from the previous topic subtly reminded the speaker of another matter, prompting the
  introduction of a new subject. 「ところで」 is typically placed at the beginning of a sentence, followed by
  the new statement or question. This usage is distinct from phrases that add further information within
  the same topic or refer to closely related matters.

  - term: そういえば
    meaning: Speaking of which, By the way, Come to think of it
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そういえば」 is used when something in the current conversation or context reminds the speaker
      of a related topic, often a sudden recollection. In contrast, 「ところで」 is for introducing a completely
      new and unrelated topic.
    grammar_point: そういえば (speaking of which)
  - term: ～と言えば・～と言うと・～と言ったら
    meaning: Speaking of, If it were the case that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This pattern is used to bring up something related to the current topic, often as a direct
      response to a keyword or idea just mentioned. 「ところで」, however, signals a more abrupt and often unrelated
      change of subject.
    grammar_point: ～と言えば・～と言うと・～と言ったら (speaking of)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「そういえば」 and 「～と言えば」 can introduce new information, their usage implies
  a connection to the ongoing discussion or a sudden remembrance related to it. 「ところで」 stands apart by
  signaling a clear, often abrupt, shift to an entirely unrelated topic, acting as a conversational reset.

    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The verb ending 「～てらっしゃる」 (te rassharu) is a highly respectful and formal form of address,
      often favored by female speakers in Japanese to convey utmost politeness and deference, especially
      when inquiring about another's family member. The honorific 「お」 before 「元気」 further enhances this
      refined and considerate tone, typical of women in polite discourse.

      women in polite conversation. The use of 「お出かけ」 (odekake), the honorific 「お」, and the polite verb

      he will treat her.

    scene: Two friends are chatting about their day, and one suddenly changes the subject to an invitation
      for dinner.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
post_example_writeup: The usage of 「ところで」 effectively shifts the conversation's focus to an unrelated
  topic. It's crucial to distinguish it from similar phrases like 「そういえば」 or 「といえば」, which introduce related
  or remembered topics. 「ところで」 is a distinct signal for a clear, often abrupt, change of subject.
