id: gp0482
meaning: without doing
pronunciation:
  katakana: ズニ・ナイデ・コトナク
  romaji: zuni・naide・kotonaku
formation:
  Verb (ない-form, drop い) + ずに: Used to express 'without doing something.' Often found in more formal or
    literary contexts than ないで.
  Verb (ない-form) + で: The most common and versatile way to express 'without doing something.' Can also
    indicate cause, meaning 'because (the first action) was not done'.
  Verb (dictionary form) + ことなく: A very formal, literary, or stiff expression meaning 'without doing something.'
    Emphasizes the complete absence of the action and is often used in significant contexts.
jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to describe an action or state that occurs without a preceding action taking place,
    or to indicate a continuous state of non-action. The choice of form depends on the desired level of
    formality and nuance.
  function: To indicate the absence of an action, either as a condition or as a simultaneous state.
  nuance: '''ないで'' is neutral. ''ずに'' implies a more deliberate or expected omission, often slightly more
    formal. ''ことなく'' is highly formal and emphasizes the complete lack or unbroken continuity of non-action,
    often in significant or dramatic contexts.'
  counterpoint: Contrast with clauses that express cause or means, as 'ないで' can sometimes function similarly
    to 'because not doing X'.
  grammatical-role: Functions adverbially, modifying the main verb of the sentence.
etymology: All three forms are rooted in negative verb constructions. 「ないで」 combines the negative auxiliary
  「ない」 with the particle 「で」, which indicates a state or cause. 「ずに」 is derived from the classical negative
  auxiliary verb 「ず」 (an older equivalent to 「ない」), combined with the particle 「に」. 「ことなく」 uses the nominalizer
  「こと」 followed by 「なく」, the negative form of 「ある」 (to exist), literally meaning 'without there being
  the matter of...'. This progression shows a movement from direct negation to more abstract and formal
  expressions of absence.
writeup: |-
  The grammar points 「ずに」, 「ないで」, and 「ことなく」 all convey the core meaning of 'without doing' a particular action. While their fundamental meaning is similar, they differ significantly in nuance, formality, and typical usage contexts. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for natural and appropriate Japanese communication.

  **「ないで」** is the most common and versatile of the three. It can be used across a wide range of situations, from casual conversations to polite speech. It simply states that the action represented by the preceding verb did not occur while the main clause's action did, or that the main action was performed in the absence of the preceding one. It can also imply a cause, meaning 'because (the first action) was not done', similar to 「〜なくて」.

  **「ずに」** is slightly more formal or literary than 「ないで」. It is often encountered in written Japanese, formal speeches, or in more set phrases. It emphasizes the omission of the action, sometimes implying a deliberate choice not to do something, or that the main action necessarily occurs in the absence of the preceding one. While 「ないで」 often focuses on the resulting state or action, 「ずに」 tends to highlight the state of *not doing* something.

  **「ことなく」** is the most formal and literary expression among the three. It is typically reserved for highly formal writing, official documents, impactful statements, or when describing significant events. This form strongly emphasizes the complete and continuous absence of the preceding action, suggesting that something happened or continued *without any interruption* or *without even a single instance* of the earlier action. It carries a strong, often emphatic tone of non-occurrence, making it unsuitable for everyday conversation.

  - term: ずに済む (get by without)
    meaning: To get by without doing something; to manage without.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 'ずに' is part of this phrase, 'ずに済む' specifically implies a positive outcome or relief
      from not having to do something (e.g., getting by without studying for a test). In contrast, 'ずに/ないで/ことなく'
      simply state the absence of an action without implying such an outcome.
    grammar_point: ずに済む (get by without)
  - term: 〜なし (without・no)
    meaning: Without; no; lacking.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '''〜なし'' is generally used with nouns to indicate absence or lack of something (e.g., 許可なし
      - without permission). ''ずに/ないで/ことなく'' are used with verbs to indicate ''without doing an action''.'
    grammar_point: なし (without・no)
  - term: う-verb (negative)
    meaning: Not; do not; does not.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The plain negative form of a verb, such as 「食べない」 (don't eat), simply states a negative fact.
      'ずに/ないで/ことなく' build upon this negation by adding particles or nominalizers to express 'without doing'
      or 'not doing and then...'. For instance, 「食べない」 vs. 「食べないで家を出た」 (left home without eating).
    grammar_point: Verb[ない] (plain negative)
  - term: ことなしに (without doing)
    meaning: Without (doing something); without (something happening).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ことなしに」 is very similar to 「ことなく」 in meaning and formality. Both express the complete absence
      of an action. However, 「ことなく」 is generally more common in modern formal writing, while 「ことなしに」 can
      feel slightly more archaic or emphasizes a condition that was not met.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ことなしに (without doing)
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share a common thread of 'absence' or 'negation',
  their usage varies significantly. When choosing between 「ずに/ないで/ことなく」 and phrases like 「ずに済む」 or 「〜なし」,
  consider whether you are describing the mere absence of an action, the beneficial outcome of not doing
  something, or the lack of a noun. Similarly, differentiate between simply stating a negative fact (using
  the plain negative form) and expressing an action performed *without* another (using 「ずに/ないで/ことなく」).
  Pay close attention to the specific grammatical role and the desired level of formality.

          - 彼 は 朝ごはん を {食べ なかっ た} の で、学校 へ 行っ た。
        english: He didn't eat breakfast, so he went to school.
        hint: This emphasizes the reason (not eating) for going to school, rather than the simultaneous
          action of going without eating. We're looking for an action performed without another preceding
          action.

          - 彼女 は 何 も {言わ なかっ た}。
        english: She didn't say anything.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 私 を {見 ない で} 通り過ぎ た。
        english: He walked past me without looking.
        hint: While technically correct, 「見ないで」 is less emphatic. 「見ることなく」 implies a more complete and
          perhaps deliberate lack of a glance, suggesting a colder or more significant disregard for the
          speaker. We're looking for that stronger nuance.
    scene: Someone recounting a moment of feeling ignored or dismissed by another person.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The use of 「見ることなく」 emphasizes the complete absence of even a glance, suggesting a deliberate
      act or a profound lack of recognition. The female speaker uses this to convey a feeling of hurt
      or being ignored, highlighting the impactful nature of the omission.

      - competing_japanese:
          - どうぞ {躊躇わ ない で} 進ん で ください。
        english: Please proceed without hesitating.
        hint: While 「躊躇わないで」 is perfectly fine here, 「躊躇せずに」 adds a slightly more resolute or formal tone,
          and 「躊躇うことなく」 conveys an even stronger, unwavering sense of moving forward. The choice depends
          on the desired level of formality and emphasis.

        english: That team won the championship without losing once.
        hint: While 「負けないで」 is grammatically correct, 「負けることなく」 conveys a stronger sense of continuous,

          like winning a championship undefeated.

        hint: 「流すことなく」 vividly emphasizes the complete absence of tears, highlighting the stoicism or
          severity of the situation more dramatically than the simpler 「流さないで」. We want that strong visual
          and emotional impact.
    scene: A narrator describing someone's incredible stoicism in a challenging or painful situation.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The use of 「涙を流すことなく」 conveys a profound level of self-control or inner strength, fitting
      for a narrative about enduring hardship without outward emotion. As a male speaker, this phrase
      might be used to express admiration for such resilience in another, emphasizing a traditional 'strong'
      image.

          - 挨拶 を {し なかっ た} から、ごめん なさい。
        english: I didn't greet you, so I'm sorry.
        hint: This focuses on the reason for the apology (the lack of greeting), not the action of leaving
          *without* greeting, which implies simultaneity. We're looking for the simultaneous omission.
    scene: A friend or acquaintance apologizing after realizing they made a social oversight.

    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: Using 「勉強することなく」 can imply a surprising ease or even a slight negative judgment (like it was
      irresponsible) of passing without effort. 「勉強せずに」 is more neutral, while 「勉強しないで」 is the most common
      and least formal. A male speaker might use this to express a sense of disbelief or mild boasting.

        english: This morning I didn't set an alarm, but I woke up early.
        hint: This is a simple conjunction of two facts (didn't set alarm + woke up early). We're looking

          action during another.
