    "etymology": "「まず」 is an adverb that originated from 「先ず」. The kanji 「先」 (saki) means 'ahead' or 'before'. Thus, its core meaning relates to 'first' or 'to begin with', indicating an initial or primary action. It is not related to 「真面目」(majime), which means 'serious' or 'earnest'.",
    "writeup": "「まず」 is an adverb that frequently **modifies an entire phrase or sentence**, often appearing at the beginning. Its core meaning conveys 'first' or 'to start with,' emphasizing that an action or topic **has priority** or must be addressed before anything else. While seemingly similar to 「最初に」 (saisho ni) or 「一番」 (ichiban), 「まず」 carries a distinct nuance of **necessity or importance** in the sequence, rather than simply temporal order or ranking. It's crucial to note that 「まず」 can often sound like you are giving advice or a recommendation. Therefore, when using it, it is advisable to employ polite language or qualify the suggestion with phrases like 「～と思います」 (to omoimasu) to indicate that it is an opinion rather than a command.",
