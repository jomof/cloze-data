    "etymology": "まず originates from the verb 「真面目（まじめ）」(majime), meaning \"serious\" or \"earnest\". Over time, it evolved to take on the meaning of \"first\" or \"before anything else,\" implying a sense of priority or importance.",
    "writeup": "「まず」, like many Japanese adverbs, often appears at the beginning of a sentence to modify the entire phrase. It carries the nuance of \"first\" or \"starting with,\" suggesting that something should be done or discussed before anything else. It's similar to 「最初に」 or 「一番」, but 「まず」 implies a sense of **priority** rather than simple order.  It can also be used to give advice, so be mindful of your tone and register when using it.",
