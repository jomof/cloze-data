    "etymology": "まず is associated with the kanji 先 (saki), meaning 'before' or 'ahead'. This connection reflects its primary function of indicating priority or sequence.",
    "writeup": "まず, like many other Japanese adverbs, modifies a whole phrase or sentence and usually appears at the beginning of a statement. Because of its connection to 先, it carries the meaning of \"first\" or \"starting with.\" Use it when you want to convey that something **should** be done or discussed before anything else, rather than something that is first in rank. Using 一番, 最初, or 一位 is more natural when discussing rank.",
