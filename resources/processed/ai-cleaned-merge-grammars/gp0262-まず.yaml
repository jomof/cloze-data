    "etymology": "「まず」 is an adverb that originated from 「先ず」. The kanji 「先」 (saki) means 'ahead' or 'before'. Thus, its core meaning relates to 'first' or 'to begin with', indicating an initial or primary action. It is not related to 「真面目」(majime), which means 'serious' or 'earnest'.",
    "writeup": "「まず」, like many Japanese adverbs, often appears at the beginning of a sentence to modify the entire phrase. It carries the nuance of \"first\" or \"starting with,\" suggesting that something should be done or discussed before anything else. It's similar to 「最初に」 or 「一番」, but 「まず」 implies a sense of **priority** rather than simple order. It can also be used to give advice, so be mindful of your tone and register when using it.",
