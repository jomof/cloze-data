details:
  part-of-speech: conjunction
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: General use when expressing critical or contradictory feelings.
  function: To express the speaker's contempt, anger, or disagreement about someone's action, behavior,
    or state.
  nuance: Carries a strong nuance of blame, disapproval, or dissatisfaction. It implies that the action
    or state is contrary to what is expected or appropriate.
etymology: 'The term 「癖 (くせ)」 originally referred to a personal inclination or preference, even a favorable
  one. Over time, its meaning shifted to denote a ''habit'' or ''tendency,'' often with a negative connotation,
  akin to a ''vice.'' The particle 「に」, in this construction, highlights a state or condition. Thus, 「くせに」
  conveys a sense of contradiction or incongruity: ''despite'' or ''even though'' something is the case,
  an unexpected or undesirable outcome or behavior occurs, leading to the speaker''s criticism or dissatisfaction.'
writeup: 'The grammar point 「くせに」 (usually written in hiragana) conveys the speaker''s strong feelings
  of **contempt, anger, or disagreement** regarding someone''s actions, behavior, or state. It is similar
  in meaning to "even though," "despite," "and yet," or "but" in English, but always carries a distinct
  nuance of **blame or disapproval**. It highlights a contradiction: what is happening is contrary to
  what one would expect given a particular situation or characteristic. 「くせに」 can attach to various word
  types: **Nouns**: Noun + 「のくせに」 (e.g., 子供のくせに - *even though you''re a child*); **Verbs**: Verb in dictionary
  form (plain non-past) + 「くせに」 (e.g., 知っているくせに - *even though you know*); **い-adjectives**: い-adjective
  (plain form) + 「くせに」 (e.g., 弱い くせに - *even though you''re weak*); **な-adjectives**: な-adjective stem
  + 「なくせに」 (e.g., 下手なくせに - *even though you''re bad at something*); **Past tense**: Any of the above in
  plain past tense form + 「くせに」 (e.g., 学生だったくせに - *even though you were a student*). This expression is
  typically used in **casual to semi-formal** contexts. It is not appropriate for formal business interactions
  or highly respectful speech. Its accusatory tone means it''s generally directed towards peers, those
  younger, or in situations where expressing strong dissatisfaction is acceptable. It''s often used when
  criticizing someone for failing to meet an expected standard or behaving inconsistently with their supposed
  status or abilities.'

  the simultaneous nature of conflicting qualities, use 「ながらも」.

      beyond their appropriate behavior. The phrase 「わがまま ばかり」 (only selfish things) further highlights
      the parent's annoyance. The 「～ください」 softens the command, making it a firm request rather than a
      harsh order.

          observation).

          accusation. We're looking for a phrase with a slightly critical tone.

    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    speaker_gender: male

          surprise).
        hint: 「なのに」 expresses simple contrast or surprise. 「くせに」 carries a stronger nuance of exasperation
          and implied criticism. We're looking for a phrase that conveys a sense of incredulity due to
          contradictory behavior.
    scene: A person expresses exasperation with their friend's poor judgment regarding cold weather.
    register: casual
    setting: serious

        english: Even though you're usually quiet, sometimes you suddenly start singing loudly, which
          surprises me (neutral surprise).
        hint: 「なのに」 indicates a simple unexpected contrast. 「くせに」 adds a slight, often good-natured, sense
          of 'even though you *should* be quiet, you do this' or 'you're being inconsistent'. We're looking
          for a phrase that subtly points out this inconsistency.
    scene: A roommate describes a quirky, unexpected habit of their friend.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The speaker is expressing a mild, good-natured surprise or slight bewilderment at the listener's

          with a broken promise.
    scene: A friend confronts another friend who broke a promise, expressing strong dissatisfaction.
    register: casual
    setting: serious

      is at fault.

        english: Even though you were a student, you were always skipping classes, weren't you? (neutral
          observation).
        hint: 「なのに」 states a fact and a contrasting outcome. 「くせに」 implies a judgment or gentle disapproval
          that the behavior was inconsistent with being a student. We're looking for a phrase that implies
          a slight reproach.
    scene: An older man reminiscing with a friend about their rebellious youth, with a hint of playful
      disapproval.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The speaker (an older male) is casually recalling past behavior, using 「くせに」 to highlight
      the irony or contradiction of the friend's actions as a student. The phrase 「ばかり だったね」 reinforces
      the repetitive nature of skipping classes. This reflects a common male way of teasing or reminiscing
      about past follies.

          nature of the effort despite the weakness, almost implying 'you shouldn't have been able to,
          but you did,' often with admiration. We're looking for a phrase that captures this strong contrast
          and admiration.
    scene: A coach encourages a former male athlete by acknowledging their past struggles while praising
      their perseverance.
    register: casual
    setting: supportive
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: While 「くせに」 still highlights a contradiction (weakness vs. effort), the overall tone is supportive
      and admiring. The 「頑張ったな」 is a masculine way to express commendation, often used by an older male
      to a younger male, acknowledging a challenge overcome despite a perceived limitation.

    scene: A female visitor expresses dismay at the current messy state of a friend's once-tidy home.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The speaker (a female) expresses genuine dismay, almost disappointment, at the stark contrast
      between the past and present state. The question 「なんで今こんなに散らかってるの？」 implies a direct questioning
      of the listener's habits, carrying a slightly critical tone that aligns with female speech patterns
      when expressing dissatisfaction in a casual setting.

        english: Even though you claim to be a professional, you made such a careless mistake (neutral
          disappointment).
        hint: 「のに」 expresses a neutral disappointment or surprise at a contradiction. 「くせに」 adds a stronger
          sense of accusation and disbelief, questioning the person's competence. We're looking for a
          phrase that implies the speaker feels the person is failing to meet their self-proclaimed standards.
    scene: A supervisor reprimands a subordinate for a significant error, questioning their professionalism.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「プロだと 言うくせに」 points out the contradiction between the person's self-proclaimed status and
      their performance, implying incompetence. The use of 「なんて」 or 「とは」 expresses astonishment or disappointment.
      This is often used when someone fails to meet the expected standards of their role, carrying a strong
      critical tone.
  - english: Even though it's summer, it's so cold. What's wrong with this weather?

          - 夏 な の に、こんな に 肌寒い 日 が 続く なんて。おかしい よ ね。
        english: Even though it's summer, it's so cold. What's wrong with this weather? (simple unexpected
          contrast).
        hint: 「なのに」 expresses a simple unexpected contrast. 「くせに」 adds a sense of exasperation, treating
          'summer' as if it's failing to uphold its expected characteristic (being warm). We're looking
          for a phrase that conveys a stronger sense of frustration at this unexpected contradiction.
    scene: Two friends are surprised by unexpectedly chilly weather during what should be a warm season.
    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    nuance: 「夏のくせに」 expresses exasperation at the weather's unexpected chilliness, treating 'summer' as
      if it has a characteristic (being warm) that it's failing to uphold. 「どうなってるんだ」 further conveys
      frustration. This usage can be almost anthropomorphic, attributing a 'will' or 'expected behavior'
      to something inanimate like the season.
post_example_writeup: The key to 「くせに」 lies in the speaker's feeling of contradiction or dissatisfaction.
  It's not just a statement of fact, but an expression of the speaker's emotional response to the unexpected
  contrast.
