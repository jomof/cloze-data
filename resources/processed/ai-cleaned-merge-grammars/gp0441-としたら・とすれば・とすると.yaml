    "etymology": "The grammar point is composed of 「と」, indicating a conditional or assumed situation, combined with different forms of 「する」 (to do): 「したら」 (past conditional), 「すれば」 (conditional), and 「とすると」 (if we assume). Each variation slightly emphasizes the hypothetical nature of the condition.",
    "writeup": "「としたら」、「とすれば」、and 「とすると」 are used to express a hypothetical situation and its potential outcome. While there are slight nuances, they are often used interchangeably to mean \"if it were the case that\" or \"assuming that.\"\n\n*   **としたら**: Suggests a slightly more casual or speculative tone.\n*   **とすれば**: Implies a more formal or logical deduction.\n*   **とすると**: Falls between the two, often used when laying out premises.\n\nTo use these expressions, simply attach 「と」 and the chosen variation to the end of a verb or い-adjective in its plain form, or to a noun or な-adjective followed by 「だ」.",
