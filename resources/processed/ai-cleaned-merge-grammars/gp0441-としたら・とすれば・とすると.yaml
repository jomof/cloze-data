        "nuance": "While sharing a core meaning, 'としたら' is generally more casual and conversational, 'とすれば' suggests a stronger logical assumption or consideration, and 'とすると' often implies leading to a logical conclusion or result based on the assumption.

    "etymology": "This grammar point is formed by combining the particle 「と」 with different conjugations of the verb 「する」 (to do). 「したら」 is the past conditional form, 「すれば」 is the conditional form (ba-form), and 「すると」 is the plain form followed by 「と」. The 「と」 particle marks the preceding clause as a condition or assumption, much like how it can indicate quotation or result. The various forms of 「する」 add slightly different shades of conditionality, from a simple hypothetical (`としたら`) to a logical premise (`とすれば`/`とすると`).",
    "writeup": "The grammar points 「としたら」, 「とすれば」, and 「とすると」 are used to express a hypothetical situation and its potential result. While there are subtle nuances, they are generally used interchangeably to mean \"if it were the case that (A), then (B)\" or \"assuming that (A), then (B)\".\n\nTo use these expressions, simply attach 「と」 and your chosen variation of 「する」 to the end of a verb in its plain form, an い-adjective in its plain form, or a noun/な-adjective followed by 「だ」. They are similar to 「もし」, but can often sound a bit more formal or analytical, particularly 「とすれば」 and 「とすると」.",
