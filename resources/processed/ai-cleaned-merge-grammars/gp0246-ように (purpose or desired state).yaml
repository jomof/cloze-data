jlpt: N4
etymology: The particle ように (yō ni) is derived from 様 (yō), meaning 'appearance,' 'manner,' or 'state.'
  When combined with に (ni), which indicates a target or result, it conveys the sense of 'in such a way
  as to' or 'so that.' Over time, its usage evolved to specifically express a purpose or a desired state,
  indicating that an action is taken to bring about a particular outcome or to facilitate a certain condition.
  The core idea is aiming for a specific 'state' or 'manner' of being or doing.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point ように is used to express the purpose or desired outcome of an action. It typically follows a verb in its dictionary form, plain negative form, or potential form. The overarching nuance of ように is that the action is performed 'in such a way as to' achieve a particular result, or 'so that' a certain state is brought about. This often implies an effort or a conscious action directed towards that end.

  When used with a plain non-past verb (dictionary form), ように indicates that the action preceding ように is done with the aim of achieving the verb's action. For instance, 「日本語が上手になる{ように}、毎日勉強しています。」(I study every day so that my Japanese will improve.) Here, the effort of studying is aimed at the result of Japanese becoming better.

  With a plain negative verb, ように signifies taking action to prevent something. For example, 「忘れ物をしない{ように}、メモをしました。」(I made a memo so that I wouldn't forget anything.) The act of making a memo is done to ensure the non-occurrence of forgetting.

  When combined with a potential verb, ように expresses doing something to enable an ability or make something possible. For example, 「よく見える{ように}、眼鏡をかけた。」(I put on my glasses so that I could see well.) The act of wearing glasses enables the ability to see clearly.

  It is crucial to understand that ように often focuses on the *result* or *change in state* that an action brings about, rather than the direct, concrete purpose of an action.

    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While both express purpose, ために focuses on the direct, often concrete, goal or reason for
      an action. ように emphasizes the resulting state, condition, or ability, often implying an indirect
      effort or a change.

  - term: Verb[dictionary]こと (formal imperative・rule)

    kind: similar expression
    nuance: こと states a rule, a general truth, or a strong suggestion, often with formality or a declarative
      tone. ように expresses a desired state or purpose that one works towards, implying an effort or goal,
      rather than a fixed rule.

  - term: 〜ようになる (come to be able to do)
    meaning: to come to be able to do, to reach a state where something happens
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜ように is the 'aim' or 'effort' towards a state, while 〜ようになる describes the 'actual attainment'
      or 'gradual development' of that state or ability. ように can be part of 〜ようになる constructions.
    grammar_point: ようになる (to come to be)
post_false_friends_writeup: The distinction between ように and ために is one of the most common points of confusion.
  Think of ように as focusing on the *outcome* or *effect* of an action, especially when that outcome is
  about ability, perception, or a change in state. It's like saying 'so that X happens' or 'in such a
  way that Y becomes possible.' ために, on the other hand, points to the *direct objective* or *reason* for
  an action. It's 'for the purpose of Z' or 'in order to do W.' If the goal is a change in ability or
  state, ように is often more appropriate. If it's a direct action's objective, ために is likely better. For
  example, 「日本語が話せる{ように}、毎日練習しています。」 (I practice every day *so that I can speak Japanese* - focuses on
  the ability). Versus, 「日本語を勉強する{ために}、日本へ行った。」 (I went to Japan *in order to study Japanese* - focuses
  on the direct objective).
