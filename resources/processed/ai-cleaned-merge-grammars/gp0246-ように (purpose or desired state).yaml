It conveys a nuance of the speaker having an indirect influence or lacking direct control over the result, implying an effort to bring about a desired state. This construction is typically translated as \"so that...\" or \"in order to allow...\".\n\nIt is commonly affixed to verbs in their potential form, for instance, when expressing the ability to do something, or to verbs in their negative form, such as when describing an action to prevent something from happening. It can also be used with verbs in their standard dictionary (non-past) form.\n\nWhen using verbs like 「する」, which do not inherently possess a potential form, 「できる」 is employed instead to form expressions such as 「できるように」.",

Pay close attention to whether the desired outcome is directly controlled by the action or if the action merely facilitates a state.",
