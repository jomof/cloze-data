formation:
  Verb[dictionary form] + であろう: Used to express conjecture about a verb's action.
  い-Adjective[dictionary form] + であろう: Used to express conjecture about an い-adjective's state.
  な-Adjective + であろう: Used to express conjecture about a な-adjective's state (the 'だ' often omitted).
  Noun + であろう: Used to express conjecture about a noun's identity or state.
jlpt: N1
etymology: The expression であろう is the formal or literary counterpart to だろう. It combines で (the conjunctive
  form of the copula だ) with あろう, which is the volitional form of the verb ある (to be, to exist). This
  structure literally conveys 'it will probably be' or 'it exists probably,' indicating a state of being
  or action that is likely to occur or be true. The evolution from the existence of 'ある' to expressing
  probability reflects a logical progression from confirming presence to inferring future or uncertain
  states.
writeup: であろう is a highly formal and literary expression primarily used to state a conjecture or probability.
  It carries a nuance of objective or detached assessment, making it suitable for academic papers, official
  reports, news broadcasts, and formal speeches. While だろう and でしょう serve similar functions in casual
  and polite speech respectively, であろう elevates the register significantly, giving statements a more authoritative
  or weighty feel. It implies that the speaker has considered the facts and arrived at a reasoned conclusion,
  rather than simply expressing a personal guess. It can attach to dictionary forms of verbs and い-adjectives,
  and to nouns or な-adjectives (often without the だ). It is less commonly heard in everyday conversation,
  even in formal settings, and its usage in spoken Japanese might sound stiff or overly academic. It is
  more prevalent in written communication.
false_friends:
  - term: だろう・でしょう
    meaning: probably, right? (conjecture or seeking agreement)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: だろう is the casual equivalent, でしょう is the polite equivalent. Both are less formal and can
      carry a nuance of seeking agreement (especially でしょう), whereas であろう is purely conjectural and formal.
    grammar_point: だろう・でしょう (probably・right?)
  - term: かもしれない
    meaning: might, maybe, perhaps
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: かもしれない expresses a weaker possibility or uncertainty compared to であろう. であろう suggests a higher
      degree of probability based on evidence or reasoning.
    grammar_point: かもしれない (might・maybe)
  - term: に違いない
    meaning: must be, no doubt, certain to be
    kind: antonym
    nuance: に違いない expresses a very strong conviction or near-certainty, stronger than であろう. であろう still
      implies a degree of probability, not absolute certainty.
    grammar_point: に違いない (no doubt)
post_false_friends_writeup: While であろう, だろう/でしょう, and かもしれない all express conjecture, they differ in formality
  and the degree of certainty implied. だろう/でしょう are the informal and polite forms for everyday use. であろう
  is a formal, often written, way to express a strong likelihood. In contrast, かもしれない suggests a weaker
  possibility, indicating "might" or "perhaps." For expressing near-certainty, に違いない is used, signifying
  "must be" or "no doubt," which is much stronger than であろう's "will probably." Choosing between these
  expressions depends on the desired level of formality and the speaker's confidence in their conjecture.
