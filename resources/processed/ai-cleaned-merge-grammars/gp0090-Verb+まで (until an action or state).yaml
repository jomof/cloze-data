formation:
  Verb (dictionary form) + まで: Indicates an action continues 'until' a certain point or event, or a state
    is maintained until a condition is met
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: teineigo (polite)
  particle-syntactic-function: temporal
  particle-pragmatic-function: limiting
  usage-context: general
  grammatical-role: adverbial particle
etymology: まで is thought to have originated from the verb 「待つ」 (matsu), meaning "to wait." Over time,
  it evolved to indicate the end point or limit of waiting, eventually becoming the particle we know today,
  signifying a boundary or extent.
writeup: まで is a particle that indicates a limit in time or extent. When attached to a verb in its dictionary
  form, まで signifies that an action continues **until** a certain event or point in time occurs. It's
  crucial to remember that the verb preceding まで is always in its dictionary (non-past) form. This is
  because the sentence describes an action or state continuing *up to* a certain point, not *after* it.
  The actual tense of the overall sentence, if describing a completed action, is determined by the main
  verb that follows. For example, in 「授業が始まる{まで}、先生が来なかった」 (The teacher didn't come until the class started),
  the verb 「始まる」 (to start) is non-past, but the main action 「来なかった」 (didn't come) is in the past tense.
  This structure accurately conveys that the teacher's absence continued up to the point the class started.
  This particle is commonly used across various registers, from casual to formal.
false_friends:
  - term: Noun+まで
    meaning: Until, Till, To (but no further than)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: When used with a noun, まで indicates a limit in space or time, but does not directly involve
      an action continuing up to that point. For example, 「駅まで」 means "to the station," indicating the
      destination limit.
    grammar_point: まで (limit extent)
  - term: までに
    meaning: By ~, By the time that ~
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: までに sets a deadline; the action must be completed *by* the specified time. Verb+まで indicates
      an action or state that continues *throughout the period* until the specified point or event.
    grammar_point: までに (by the time)
  - term: まで (even to the extent)
    meaning: Even, To even, To the extent of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: In this usage, まで functions as an emphatic particle, expressing surprise or indicating something
      unexpected or extreme (e.g., 「子供まで知っている」 - 'Even children know'). This is distinct from its temporal
      function with verbs.
    grammar_point: まで (even to the extent)
  - term: たら
    meaning: If/When X happens
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Verb+まで indicates an action continues *up to* a point; the たら conditional states a consequence
      *after* a point or a hypothetical scenario. It doesn't imply a continuous action leading up to the
      event.
    grammar_point: たら (if・when・after)
  - term: Verb[た] 後に
    meaning: After X happens
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Verb+まで indicates an action or state *until* X happens; 後に describes an action that occurs
      *after* X has already happened. The temporal relationship is reversed.
    grammar_point: てから (after and since)
  - term: うちに (while・before change)
    meaning: While, during, before (a change occurs)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Verb+まで emphasizes the endpoint when an action ceases. Verb+うちに focuses on an action happening
      *within* the period before a state changes, often implying that the action must be done *before*
      that change occurs.
    grammar_point: うちに (while・before change)
  - term: までもない (needless to say)
    meaning: There is no need to, Do not have to, It is not necessary to, Needless to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Verb+まで indicates duration up to a point. までもない is a set phrase meaning 'there's no need to
      do X,' completely unrelated to time or extent, despite sharing 'まで'.
    grammar_point: までもない (needless to say)
  - term: まで (that's all there is to it)
    meaning: Just; merely; only; that's all; nothing more
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This usage of まで functions as an adverbial phrase to mean 'just' or 'merely', often implying
      simplicity or limitation, quite distinct from its temporal 'until' with verbs.
    grammar_point: まで (that's all there is to it)
post_false_friends_writeup: While Verb+まで specifies a continuous action or state *up to* a certain point,
  be careful not to confuse it with related expressions that denote different temporal relationships.
  For instance, 「までに」 explicitly sets a deadline for completion, not a duration. Similarly, conditionals
  like 「〜たら」 describe an outcome that follows or is dependent on an event, rather than a continuous action
  leading up to it. Expressions like 「うちに」 imply an action occurring *within* a period before a change,
  offering a slightly different nuance of timing. Other usages of 「まで」 or 「までもない」 are set phrases or adverbs
  that do not convey a temporal limit, despite sharing the same particle. Understanding these distinctions
  is crucial for precise communication.
examples:
  - english: Let's wait quietly until the teacher comes.
    japanese:
      - 先生 が 来る {まで}、静か に 待っ て い ましょう。
      - 先生 が 来る {まで}、静か に 待っ て いよう。
      - 先生 が いらっしゃる {まで}、静か に お 待ち し ましょう。
      - 先生 来る {まで}、静か に 待っ て て ね。
      - 先生 が 来る {まで}、黙っ て 待と う よ。
    english_literally: Teacher comes until, quietly let's be waiting.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 が 来 {たら}、静か に 待っ て い ましょう。
        english: If/When the teacher comes, let's wait quietly.
        hint: Using 「〜たら」 (conditional) would imply waiting *after* the teacher arrives, or waiting *if*
          they arrive, which doesn't convey the continuous state of waiting *until* the specific event.
          We're looking for an action that continues throughout the period until the teacher's arrival.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 が 来る {まで に}、静か に 待っ て い ましょう。
        english: Let's wait quietly by the time the teacher comes.
        hint: 「までに」 sets a deadline for an action to be completed, not a continuous state. We're looking
          for a continuous action until the teacher arrives.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 が 来 た {後 に}、静か に 待っ て い ましょう。
        english: After the teacher came, let's wait quietly.
        hint: 「〜た 後に」 indicates an action that occurs *after* another. We're looking for a continuous
          action *until* the teacher returns.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 の 到着 {まで}、静か に 待っ て い ましょう。
        english: I will wait quietly until the teacher's arrival.
        hint: While 「Noun+まで」 is grammatical, it uses a noun to indicate a limit in time or space, but
          does not directly involve an action continuing up to that point. We're looking for an action
          that continues until the teacher comes.
    scene: Students are in a classroom before class, and one suggests how they should conduct themselves.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    nuance: The volitional 「〜ましょう」 makes this a polite suggestion for a shared action, suitable for a
      formal register. 「先生」 and 「来る」 are common N5 level words. 「静かに」 is written in hiragana, suitable
      for N5 context where the kanji for 'shizuka' (静) might be N3, ensuring accessibility.
  - english: I ate until I was full.
    japanese:
      - お腹 が いっぱい に なる {まで} 食べ まし た。
      - お腹 が いっぱい に なる {まで} 食べ た。
      - お腹 いっぱい に なる {まで} 食べ た。
      - 腹 いっぱい に なる {まで} 食っ た。
      - お腹 いっぱい に なる {まで} 食べ た よ。
    english_literally: Stomach becomes full until ate.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - お腹 が いっぱい に なっ {たら} 食べ まし た。
        english: After becoming full, I ate.
        hint: Using 「〜たら」 here would mean 'after becoming full, I ate,' which is illogical. We're looking
          for an action that continued *up to the point* of becoming full.
      - competing_japanese:
          - お腹 が いっぱい に なる {まで に} 食べ まし た。
        english: By the time I became full, I ate.
        hint: 「までに」 implies completion by a deadline, not a continuous state. We're looking for continuous
          eating until reaching fullness.
      - competing_japanese:
          - お腹 が いっぱい に なっ た {後 に} 食べ まし た。
        english: After becoming full, I ate.
        hint: 「〜た 後に」 indicates an action that occurs *after* another. This makes the sentence illogical
          in this context. We're looking for eating *until* fullness.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 満腹 {まで} 食べ まし た。
        english: I ate up to fullness.
        hint: While 「満腹まで」 is grammatical, it uses 「Noun+まで」 to indicate a limit in state. 「Verb+まで」 is
          used to describe the action of eating that continues *until* the state of being full is reached.
    scene: Someone describing their meal, having finished eating.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: This example emphasizes the action of eating continuing right up to the point of a desired
      state being reached. 「お腹」, 「いっぱい」, 「なる」, 「食べる」 are all N5 level words, making this a basic and common
      usage.
  - english: I won't play games until my homework is finished.
    japanese:
      - 宿題 が 終わる {まで} ゲーム を し ませ ん。
      - 宿題 が 終わる {まで} ゲーム は し ない。
      - 宿題 が 終わる {まで} ゲーム は し ねえ ぞ。
      - 宿題 終わる {まで} ゲーム は し ない から ね！
      - 宿題 が 終わる {まで} は ゲーム を 致し ませ ん。
    english_literally: Homework finishes until game won't do.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 宿題 が 終わっ た {後 に} ゲーム を し ませ ん。
        english: After the homework is finished, I won't play games.
        hint: Using 「〜た 後に」 would mean 'after the homework is finished, I won't play games,' which isn't
          the intention of a temporary restriction. We're looking for a prohibition that is *in effect
          until* the homework is done.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 宿題 が 終わる {まで に} ゲーム を し ませ ん。
        english: By the time the homework finishes, I won't play games.
        hint: 「までに」 indicates a deadline for an action to be completed, not a continuous state of not
          doing something. We're looking for a prohibition that lasts until the homework is finished.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 宿題 が 終わっ {たら} ゲーム を し ませ ん。
        english: If/When the homework finishes, I won't play games.
        hint: 「〜たら」 would mean 'if/when the homework finishes, I won't play games,' which implies that
          the refusal to play games starts *after* the homework is done, rather than the prohibition being
          *in effect until* it's done.
    scene: A student making a self-disciplined promise or declaring a temporary restriction.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: This example shows a negative action or prohibition that lasts until a specific condition
      (homework completion) is met. The casual negative 「しない」 and the emphatic male speech particle 「ぞ」
      in 「しねえぞ」 indicate a strong, casual determination, suitable for a male speaker. 「宿題」 (N4), 「終わる」
      (N3), 「ゲーム」 (N5), 「する」 (N5) use kanji appropriate for the N4-N3 level.
  - english: Let's read a book until he comes back.
    japanese:
      - 彼 が 帰っ て 来る {まで}、本 を 読もう。
      - 彼 が 帰っ て 来る {まで}、本 を 読み ましょう。

          - 彼 が 帰っ て 来 {たら}、本 を 読もう。
        english: If/When he comes back, let's read a book.
        hint: Using 「〜たら」 here would imply reading *after* he comes, or reading *if* he comes. We're looking
          for an activity that will occur *during the waiting period*.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が 帰っ て 来る {まで に}、本 を 読もう。
        english: By the time he comes back, let's read a book.
        hint: 「までに」 implies completing an action by a deadline, not engaging in a continuous activity
          until that point. We're looking for reading *during* the wait.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が 帰っ て 来 た {後 に}、本 を 読もう。
        english: After he comes back, let's read a book.
        hint: 「〜た 後に」 indicates an action that occurs *after* another. We're looking for reading *until*
          he returns.
    scene: Two people waiting for a friend to arrive and suggesting an activity to pass the time.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 'The volitional form 「読もう」 suggests a shared action during the period of waiting. The sentence
      is composed entirely of N5 kanji: 「彼」, 「帰る」, 「来る」, 「本」, 「読む」. 「読もっか」 is a very casual, inviting
      form of 「読もう」.'

        english: After finishing the report, please give me more time.
        hint: Using 「〜た 後に」 would be illogical, as it would mean 'after finishing the report, please give
          me more time.' We're looking for a request for continued time *until* the task is completed.
      - competing_japanese:
          - レポート を 書き 終える {まで に}、もう 少し 時間 を ください。
        english: By the time I finish writing the report, please give me a little more time.
        hint: 「までに」 implies completion by a deadline. This sentence is about *having* time *until* a task
          is finished, not completing the act of asking for time by then. We're looking for permission
          to use time continuously until completion.
      - competing_japanese:
          - レポート を 書き 終え {たら}、もう 少し 時間 を ください。
        english: If/When I finish writing the report, please give me a little more time.
        hint: 「〜たら」 sets a condition. This phrase requests time *until* the task is done, implying a continuous
          need for time, not time given *after* completion. We're looking for permission to continue using
          time until the report is finished.
    scene: A busy employee respectfully asking their boss for an extension on a task.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: This polite request uses 「〜てください」 to ask for an extension of time, indicating that the speaker
      needs that duration to complete the task. The phrase 「もう少し お時間 を 頂戴できますでしょうか」 is a highly formal
      and humble way to ask, appropriate for a professional setting when addressing a superior. 「レポート」
      (loanword) and 「書き終える」 (writing to completion, involving N3 kanji for 「終える」) are appropriate for
      an N3 example.

        english: If/When I can forgive his lies, I decided not to talk to him.
        hint: Using 「〜たら」 (conditional) would mean 'if/when I can forgive his lies, I decided not to talk
          to him,' which changes the meaning from a condition for resuming communication to a decision
          made based on a hypothetical. We're looking for a decision to maintain a state of not talking
          *until* a specific emotional resolution is reached.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 嘘 を 許せる {まで に}、話さ ない と 決め た。
        english: By the time I can forgive his lies, I decided not to talk to him.
        hint: 「までに」 sets a deadline for an action to be completed, not a continuous state of not doing
          something. We're looking for a decision to continue not talking *until* the condition is met.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 嘘 を 許せ た {後 に}、話さ ない と 決め た。
        english: After I could forgive his lies, I decided not to talk to him.
        hint: 「〜た 後に」 indicates an action that occurs *after* another. This implies the decision was made
          *after* forgiveness, not that the non-talking state continues *until* forgiveness. We're looking
          for the state of not talking to persist until forgiveness.
    scene: Someone reflecting on a personal conflict and setting a boundary in a relationship.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: This sentence expresses a firm decision to maintain a state (not talking) until a specific
      emotional or relational condition (forgiveness) is met. The kanji 「嘘」 (N4), 「許す」 (N3), and 「決める」
      (N4) are suitable for an N3 example, showing complex emotional states. 「口 を きかない」 is a strong, idiomatic
      expression for 'not talking' or 'not speaking to someone'.

          - 新しい プラン を 皆 が 理解 する {まで に}、議論 を 続け ましょう。
        english: By the time everyone understands the new plan, let's continue the discussion.
        hint: 「までに」 indicates a deadline for an action to be completed, not a continuous activity that
          ceases at a certain point. We're looking for the discussion to *continue until* understanding.
    scene: A project team leader addressing their colleagues during a meeting, emphasizing the need for
      thorough comprehension of a new strategy.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The polite volitional 「〜ましょう」 is used, appropriate for a professional setting. The phrase
      「新しいプランを皆が理解するまで」 precisely indicates the duration of the discussion, emphasizing thoroughness and
      collective understanding.

          state of being awake to *continue until* the drama's conclusion.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 大好き な ドラマ が 終わる {まで に}、起き て い ます。
        english: By the time my favorite drama ends, I will be awake.
        hint: 「までに」 sets a deadline for an action, not a continuous state of being. We're looking for
          the state of being awake to *last until* the drama finishes.
    scene: Someone talking to themselves or a friend about watching TV late at night.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: This example demonstrates a continuous state (being awake) lasting until an event (the drama
      ending). 「起きている」 is a common expression. The use of 「〜います」 for a continuous state is standard polite
      form, while 「〜てるよ」 is more casual.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 赤ちゃん は お 母 さん が 帰っ て 来る {まで に}、泣い て い まし た。
        english: By the time its mother came back, the baby cried.
        hint: 「までに」 indicates an action completed *by* a deadline, not a continuous state lasting *until*
          a point. We're looking for the crying to have *lasted until* the mother's return.
    scene: Someone recounting an anecdote about a child.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: This sentence illustrates a continuous action (crying) that ceases when the condition (mother's
      return) is met. The past tense 「泣いていました」 appropriately describes a completed continuous action.
      「お母さん」 is a common, affectionate term for mother.

        english: By the time you can write without looking, you should practice kanji every day.
        hint: 「までに」 indicates completion *by* a deadline. We're looking for the practice to *continue
          until* you achieve that ability.
    scene: A Japanese language teacher giving advice to a student.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    nuance: This example provides advice for continuous action (practicing) until a skill is mastered
      (writing kanji without looking). 「〜べきです」 is a strong, formal way to give advice or state an obligation.
      「見ないで書ける」 uses the potential form of 「書く」, showing the desired ability.
  - english: I will continue studying until I pass the N1 exam.
    japanese:
      - N 1 試験 に 合格 する {まで}、勉強 を 続け ます。
      - N 1 試験 に 合格 する {まで}、勉強 を 続ける よ。
      - N 1 試験 に 合格 する {まで}、勉強 を 頑張る ぞ。
      - N 1 試験 に 合格 する {まで}、勉強 し 続ける わ。
    english_literally: N1 exam pass until, study will continue.

      - competing_japanese:
          - N 1 試験 に 合格 し {たら}、勉強 を 続け ます。
        english: If/When I pass the N1 exam, I will continue studying.
        hint: Using 「〜たら」 implies a conditional action that starts *after* passing the exam. We're looking
          for continuous studying *until* the exam is passed.
      - competing_japanese:
          - N 1 試験 に 合格 する {まで に}、勉強 を 続け ます。
        english: By the time I pass the N1 exam, I will continue studying.
        hint: 「までに」 indicates a deadline for an action to be completed, not a continuous state of doing
          something *until* a point. We're looking for studying that continues throughout the period until
          success.
      - competing_japanese:
          - N 1 試験 に 合格 し た {後 に}、勉強 を 続け ます。
        english: After passing the N1 exam, I will continue studying.
        hint: 「〜た 後に」 indicates an action that occurs *after* another. This means continuing to study
          *after* passing, not *until* passing. We're looking for the study to persist until the goal
          is achieved.
    scene: A student talking about their long-term goal and determination.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: This example highlights a continuous effort (studying) that persists until a specific objective
      (passing the N1 exam) is met. The use of 「頑張るぞ」 expresses strong determination, commonly used by
      male speakers. 「勉強し続ける」 emphasizes the unbroken continuation of study.
post_example_writeup: The usage of まで with verbs always requires the verb to be in its dictionary (non-past)
  form. This is a common point of initial confusion for learners who might try to match the tense of the
  preceding verb with the tense of the main clause. However, the particle まで inherently defines the temporal
  boundary *up to* which an action or state continues. The overall tense of the sentence is determined
  by the final verb in the main clause. Mastering this distinction is key to accurately conveying durations
  and limits in Japanese.
