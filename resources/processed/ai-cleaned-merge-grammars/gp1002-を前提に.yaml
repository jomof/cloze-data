        "nuance": "Indicates that something is being considered as a foundational assumption or condition upon which a decision, action, or plan is based. Often used in business, academic, and serious contexts."
    },
    "etymology": "「前提 (ぜんてい)」 literally means \"pre-presentation\" or \"pre-established condition.\" The phrase 「を前提に」 uses the particle 「を」 to mark 「前提」 as the object of consideration, and 「に」 to indicate that something is based on that premise.",
    "writeup": "「を前提に」 is a pattern that combines the adverbial particle 「を」, the noun 「前提」 (premise) or (hypothesis), and the case-marking particle 「に」. It is often translated as \"on the premise of (A),\" and marks something as the base thought or goal toward which some other (B) action is being taken.\n\nThis structure will be used following nouns, or verbs that have been nominalized with 「こと」.\n\nAlternatively, either 「にして」 or 「として」 may be used in place of 「に」 by itself. This only slightly changes the nuance in the same way that is to be expected of these structures. 「を前提にして」 will sound more active as “toward the premise of (A), (B).” While 「を前提として」 sounds more passive as “with (A) as the premise (B).",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「を前提に」, which sets a condition or foundational assumption for a subsequent action or design, 「に基づいて」 indicates that something is being done strictly according to a particular standard, rule, or piece of information. 「を前提に」 allows for projection or future-oriented conditions, while 「に基づいて」 implies adherence to existing facts or guidelines."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「を前提に」 and 「に基づいて」 involve a foundational element, the key distinction lies in their nature. 「を前提に」 emphasizes an underlying assumption or pre-condition upon which a decision or action is based, often implying a projective or hypothetical scenario. In contrast, 「に基づいて」 signifies that an action or conclusion is derived directly from established facts, rules, or data, indicating strict adherence or reliance on existing information. To choose correctly, consider whether the basis is an assumption/condition for future action or a rule/fact guiding present action.",
