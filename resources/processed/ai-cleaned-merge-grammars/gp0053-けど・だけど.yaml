        "part-of-speech": "conjunction",
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "general conversation",
        "function": "connects two clauses, expressing contrast, concession, or a preliminary statement",
        "nuance": "Indicates a mild contrast or reservation, often used to soften a statement or introduce background information. More casual than が or けれども."
    },
    "etymology": "けど is a shortened, more casual form of けれども (keredomo). けれども itself is generally understood to derive from 係る (kakaru, 'to concern, to relate to') + ども (domo), a conjunctive particle expressing concession, eventually contracting to けれど and then けど. Thus, the original sense conveyed 'though it relates to' or 'although it is concerned with'.",
    "writeup": "けど is a versatile conjunctive particle used to connect two clauses (A and B). It functions similarly to が, often conveying a sense of \"while thinking about A, B,\" which translates to \"but\" or \"however\" in English. When けど follows a な-adjective or a noun, the linking verb だ is required, forming だけど. This makes だけど an essential part of the grammar point for these word types.\n\nけど is a more modern and casual form of けれども, and it exists on a spectrum of formality:\n*   **Casual**: けど\n*   **Less Casual**: けども\n*   **Neutral/Slightly Formal**: けれど\n*   **Formal**: けれども\n*   **Most Formal/General**: が\n\nA significant feature of けど is that the phrase after it can often be omitted if its meaning is obvious from context or if the speaker wishes to imply something without explicitly stating it. This allows for a more subtle and nuanced communication style.",

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "reflective",
            "nuance": "The phrase 「毎日勉強するけど」 introduces the effort, while 「まだ日本語が難しい」 states the persistent challenge. 「けど」 here provides a mild, almost resigned, contrast typical in casual self-reflection about learning."

            "nuance": "「親切だけど」 acknowledges a positive trait, and 「時々ちょっと静かです」 adds a contrasting observation. The use of 「だけど」 is suitable for a casual, personal assessment among peers, sounding more observational than critical compared to more formal alternatives like ですが."
