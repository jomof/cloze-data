    "etymology": "けど is a shortened, more casual form of けれども (keredomo). けれども itself is generally understood to derive from 係る (kakaru, 'to concern, to relate to') + ども (domo), a conjunctive particle expressing concession, eventually contracting to けれど and then けど. Thus, the original sense conveyed 'though it relates to' or 'although it is concerned with'.",
    "writeup": "けど is a conjunctive particle functioning to connect two parts of a sentence (A and B), similar to が. It conveys a sense of \"while thinking about A, B,\" often translated as \"but\" or \"however\" in English. When けど follows a な-adjective or a noun, だ is required, forming だけど. This makes だけど an essential part of the grammar point for certain preceding word types.\n\nけど is a more modern and casual version of けれども, and exists on a spectrum of formality, from casual to formal: けど, けども, けれど, けれども, が.\n\nThe phrase after けど can be omitted if its meaning is obvious from context or if the speaker wishes to imply something without explicitly stating it. This grammar point is gender neutral.",

        "violation: Removed top-level 'bunpro' and 'lesson_order' fields from the input JSON as per rule 20 ('You must not add top-level 'bunpro' or 'dojg' fields to the output JSON.').",
        "violation: Corrected the 'etymology' field. The previous etymology linked けれども to 蹴る ('to kick'), which is not widely accepted. The revised version provides a more common etymology deriving from 係る ('to concern') + ども (concessive particle). This aligns with rule 4 ('You must add an 'etymology' field here that discusses the etymology of this grammar point.') and implies accuracy.",
        "violation: Modified the 'formation' field to be more specific, explicitly detailing how けど and だけど attach to different parts of speech (verbs, i-adjectives, na-adjectives, nouns). The previous formation was too generic for 'だけど' and didn't clearly outline the 'だ' requirement. This better fulfills rule 1.2 ('You must add a 'formation' tag...that describes, in pseudo-algebraic notation, the formula...').",
        "violation: Removed the 'conjugation: null' field from all example sentences. Rule 6 specifies that this field should only be present if there is a top-level 'conjugations' array, which is not present for this non-conjugatable grammar point.",
        "violation: Rewrote the first example sentence from 'パソコンはないけど。(大丈夫?)' to 'パソコンは ない {けど} 、 明日 まで に 提出 しても いい です か ？' to remove parentheses and ensure it is a single, grammatically complete sentence as per rule 6 ('Must be just one sentence unless. Must not use parentheses').",
        "violation: Ensured all example sentences have the grammar point properly bolded within curly braces, e.g., '{けど}', as required by rule 6 ('The 'japanese' should have the grammar_point in {bold} (surrounded in curlies).').",
        "violation: In the last example sentence, '君 の こと 、 もっと 知り たい {けど} 、 今日 は もう 遅い から 、 また 今度 連絡 しても いい ？', the kanji 絡 (part of 連絡) is N2 according to the provided JLPT Kanji list. This violates the rule to use kanji appropriate for the N5 level (N5, N4, N3 only). I changed '連絡' to 'お話' to use N5/N4/N3 kanji ('話' is N5). This ensures the example adheres to rule 6 ('The japanese must not use hiragana for words that are typically written in kanji.' and implies using appropriate kanji for the JLPT level).",
        "violation: Expanded the 'nuance' for example sentences where 'speaker_gender' or 'listener_gender' were specified to explicitly mention the specific Japanese phrasing, in quotes, that highlights the gendered nuance or interaction as required by rule 6 ('If there is a 'speaker_gender', then 'nuance' must mention the specific Japanese, in 「quotes」, that would only be spoken by that gender.').",
        "unnatural: Minor rephrasing and improved flow in the 'writeup' section for better clarity and conciseness, without changing its core meaning. Also explicitly added the 'gender neutral' statement at the end for clarity, consistent with the prior writeup.",
        "suggestion: Adjusted the 'setting' for one example from 'casual' to 'informative' to increase the variety of settings across the examples, as suggested by rule 6 ('Example sentences should exhibit a wide variety of settings.')."
