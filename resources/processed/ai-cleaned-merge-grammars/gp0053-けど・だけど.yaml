    "etymology": "けど is a shortened, more casual form of けれども (keredomo). けれども itself is generally understood to derive from 係る (kakaru, 'to concern, to relate to') + ども (domo), a conjunctive particle expressing concession, eventually contracting to けれど and then けど. Thus, the original sense conveyed 'though it relates to' or 'although it is concerned with'.",
    "writeup": "けど is a conjunctive particle functioning to connect two parts of a sentence (A and B), similar to が. It conveys a sense of \"while thinking about A, B,\" often translated as \"but\" or \"however\" in English. When けど follows a な-adjective or a noun, だ is required, forming だけど. This makes だけど an essential part of the grammar point for certain preceding word types.\n\nけど is a more modern and casual version of けれども, and exists on a spectrum of formality, from casual to formal: けど, けども, けれど, けれども, が.\n\nThe phrase after けど can be omitted if its meaning is obvious from context or if the speaker wishes to imply something without explicitly stating it. This grammar point is gender neutral.",

                    "mitigation": "Using two separate sentences would sound blunt and lack the subtle connection and underlying reason provided by けど, which indicates the first clause is a premise for the second. The scene implies a hesitant request, where けど helps soften the statement."

                    "mitigation": "The more formal expression ～にもかかわらず (despite/nevertheless) would sound overly dramatic and unnatural for a personal, reflective thought about whether a dress suits oneself. けど offers a direct and softer contrast appropriate for internal monologue."
