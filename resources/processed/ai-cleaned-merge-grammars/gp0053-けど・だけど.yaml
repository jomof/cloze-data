    "etymology": "けど is a shortened, more casual form of けれども (keredomo). けれども itself is derived from the verb 蹴る (keru, \"to kick\") + the auxiliary verb ども (domo, expressing concession). Over time, けれども became more common, and けど evolved as a further simplification.",
    "writeup": "けど is a conjunctive particle functioning to connect two parts of a sentence (A and B), similar to が. It conveys a sense of \"while thinking about A, B,\" often translated as \"but\" or \"however\" in English. When けど follows a な-adjective or a noun, だ is required (hence だけど).  It's a more modern and casual version of けれども, and exists on a spectrum of formality: Casual: けど, けども, けれど, けれども, が: Formal. The phrase after けど can be omitted if it's obvious or the speaker doesn't want to explicitly state it. This grammar point is gender neutral.",

By paying attention to the register and the specific nuance you want to convey, you can choose the most appropriate expression for your needs."
