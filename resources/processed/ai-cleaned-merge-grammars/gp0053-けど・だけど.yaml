    },
    "etymology": "けど is a shortened, more casual form of けれども (keredomo). けれども itself is generally understood to derive from 係る (kakaru, 'to concern, to relate to') + ども (domo), a conjunctive particle expressing concession, eventually contracting to けれど and then けど. Thus, the original sense conveyed 'though it relates to' or 'although it is concerned with'.",
    "writeup": "けど is a versatile conjunctive particle used to connect two clauses (A and B). It functions similarly to が, often conveying a sense of \"while thinking about A, B,\" which translates to \"but\" or \"however\" in English. When けど follows a な-adjective or a noun, the linking verb だ is required, forming だけど. This makes だけど an essential part of the grammar point for these word types.\n\nけど is a more modern and casual form of けれども, and it exists on a spectrum of formality:\n*   **Casual**: けど\n*   **Less Casual**: けども\n*   **Neutral/Slightly Formal**: けれど\n*   **Formal**: けれども\n*   **Most Formal/General**: が\n\nA significant feature of けど is that the phrase after it can often be omitted if its meaning is obvious from context or if the speaker wishes to imply something without explicitly stating it. This allows for a more subtle and nuanced communication style.",
