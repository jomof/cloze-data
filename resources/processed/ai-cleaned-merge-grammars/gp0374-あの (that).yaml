meaning: that (over there / far from both speaker and listener)
pronunciation:
  katakana: アノ
  romaji: ano
formation:
  あの + Noun: Used to modify a noun, indicating that the noun is far from both the speaker and the listener.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The Japanese demonstrative system, often referred to as the こ・そ・あ・ど series, is a fundamental
  aspect of the language's spatial and contextual referencing. The 'あ' series, including あの, あれ, あそこ,
  and あちら, originates from ancient forms indicating something distant from both the speaker and the listener.
  This 'a' sound historically conveyed a sense of 'over there' or 'away from both parties,' distinguishing
  it from 'ko' (near speaker) and 'so' (near listener or previously mentioned). This system is deeply
  ingrained in the language, reflecting a cognitive emphasis on relative distance in communication.
writeup: あの (ano) is a demonstrative determiner, part of the こ・そ・あ・ど (ko, so, a, do) series. It is used
  to refer to something that is physically or conceptually distant from **both** the speaker and the listener.
  Unlike これ (kore) and この (kono) which refer to things near the speaker, or それ (sore) and その (sono) which
  refer to things near the listener, あの points to something further away from both. When using あの, you
  are effectively pointing to an object, person, or concept that is not in the immediate vicinity of either
  participant in the conversation. It functions as an adjective, always preceding the noun it modifies,
  such as あの 人 (ano hito, that person over there) or あの 山 (ano yama, that mountain over there). It can
  also refer to something conceptually distant, like あの 時 (ano toki, that time in the past) or あの 件 (ano
  ken, that matter we discussed earlier).

  - term: この (this)
    meaning: this (near speaker)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「この」 refers to something physically or conceptually close to the speaker. 「あの」 refers to something
      far from both speaker and listener.
    grammar_point: この (this)
  - term: その (that)
    meaning: that (near listener)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「その」 refers to something physically or conceptually close to the listener, or something previously
      mentioned. 「あの」 refers to something physically far from both the speaker and the listener.
    grammar_point: その (that)
  - term: あれ (that over there)
    meaning: that over there (pronoun, far from both)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「あれ」 is a pronoun, meaning it can stand alone (e.g., 「あれ は 何 です か？」). 「あの」 is a determiner
      and *must* be followed by a noun (e.g., 「あの 人」). Both refer to something far from both speaker and
      listener.
    grammar_point: あれ (that over there)
  - term: どの (which)
    meaning: which (determiner)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どの」 is an interrogative determiner, asking "which [noun]?". 「あの」 is a demonstrative determiner,
      pointing to "that [noun]".
    grammar_point: どの (which)
post_false_friends_writeup: The key to distinguishing between あの and its counterparts lies in understanding
  its role as a demonstrative determiner for distant objects or concepts, contrasted with こ・そ for proximity
  and あ for general farness. Remember that あの always modifies a noun, while あれ, それ, これ, and どれ are pronouns
  that stand alone. This grammatical difference is crucial for correct usage.
examples:
  - english: Who is that person over there?
    japanese:
      - あの 人 は 誰 です か？
      - あの 人 誰？
      - あの 人 って 誰？
    english_literally: That person (over there) is who?

    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「あの 頃」 (ano koro) places the time period in the distant past, creating a nostalgic
      or reflective tone. It's a common phrase used by older speakers when recalling their youth, conveying
      a sense of temporal distance rather than physical. It could be used by any speaker or listener gender,
      but the context of reminiscing childhood by an 'older' speaker fits well.
