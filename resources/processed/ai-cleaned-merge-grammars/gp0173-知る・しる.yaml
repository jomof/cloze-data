    "writeup": "The verb 「知る・しる」 means \"to know\" or \"to get to know\". It indicates the state of being aware of something or the action of becoming aware of it. Because 「知る」 is a non-stative verb, it often appears in the 「～ている」 form (知っている) to express the **state** of knowing. Without the 「～ている」 form, it indicates the **action** of coming to know something.",
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「知る・しる」 is related to the concept of discerning and distinguishing. It shares roots with other words related to understanding and wisdom. It is one of the core verbs in the Japanese language for expressing knowledge and awareness.",
