    "etymology": "The word “そこ” comes from the demonstrative series “こそあど” (kosoado). “そ” indicates something near the listener, distinguishing it from “ここ” (here, near the speaker) and “あそこ” (over there, away from both).",
    "writeup": "“そこ” is part of the “こそあど” family of words, specifically used to refer to a place near the listener. It corresponds to “that place” or “there”. Similar to how “それ” (that) refers back to a previously mentioned object, “そこ” refers back to a previously mentioned location. Additionally, “そこ” can refer to an abstract place or situation, such as a point in a discussion or a stage in a process. Important Consideration: Do not confuse “そこ” with “そっち”. While both can translate to “there,” “そっち” emphasizes direction, while “そこ” focuses on a specific place.",
