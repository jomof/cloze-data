    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ようにする」 combines 「よう」, meaning 'way' or 'manner,' with the verb 「する」, 'to do.' Thus, it literally means 'to do in such a way that...' This conveys the nuance of actively making an effort to achieve a certain outcome or maintain a certain behavior. 「よう」 derives from 「様」, suggesting aiming for success in a specific manner.",
    "writeup": "「ようにする」 combines the auxiliary verb 「よう」 with 「する」. The 「よう」 is the adverbial form of 「ようだ」. This structure emphasizes that an action is something the speaker is actively trying to do. When used with a negative verb, it means actively avoiding something, translating to \"to make sure not to do (A).\" Because 「よう」 comes from the kanji 「様」 ('manner'), it suggests doing something in a way that aims for success. Thus, it strengthens the action by implying a deliberate and purposeful approach. This grammar point implies a sustained effort or intention, rather than a one-time action. The nuance is that you're setting a goal and consistently working towards it.",

        "violation: Corrected 'conjugation' type for examples using 'ようにしています' from 'polite (non-past)' to 'progressive (～ている)' to accurately reflect the usage of the grammar point in its progressive form (Rule: 'Conjugation must be about the main grammar point and not other parts of the sentence.').",
        "violation: Corrected 'conjugation' type for the example using 'ようにしてください' from 'imperative (polite)' to 'te-form (～て)' as 'ようにして' is the te-form of 'ようにする', and 'ください' is an auxiliary verb. (Rule: 'Conjugation must be about the main grammar point and not other parts of the sentence.').",

Do not change anything that already follows the rules. ... The one exception is that there may be comments (starting with // ) in the prior grammar points.
