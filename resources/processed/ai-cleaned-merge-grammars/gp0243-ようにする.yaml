    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ようにする」 combines 「よう」, meaning 'way' or 'manner,' with the verb 「する」, 'to do.' Thus, it literally means 'to do in such a way that...' This conveys the nuance of actively making an effort to achieve a certain outcome or maintain a certain behavior. 「よう」 derives from 「様」, suggesting aiming for success in a specific manner.",
    "writeup": "「ようにする」 combines the auxiliary verb 「よう」 with 「する」. The 「よう」 is the adverbial form of 「ようだ」. This structure emphasizes that an action is something the speaker is actively trying to do. When used with a negative verb, it means actively avoiding something, translating to \"to make sure not to do (A).\" Because 「よう」 comes from the kanji 「様」 ('manner'), it suggests doing something in a way that aims for success. Thus, it strengthens the action by implying a deliberate and purposeful approach. This grammar point implies a sustained effort or intention, rather than a one-time action. The nuance is that you're setting a goal and consistently working towards it.",
