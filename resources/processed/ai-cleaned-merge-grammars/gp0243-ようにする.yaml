    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ようにする」 combines 「よう」 and 「する」. The term 「よう」 (様) originally referred to 'manner' or 'appearance.' When combined with 「する」 (to do), it literally means 'to do in such a manner that...' or 'to act in a way that brings about a certain result.' This linguistic evolution highlights the deliberate and purposeful nature of the action, emphasizing that the speaker is actively making an effort to achieve a specific outcome or establish a consistent behavior. The nuance of aiming for success or a desired state is inherent in its etymology.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ようにする」 expresses a conscious and sustained effort to perform an action regularly, achieve a certain state, or to avoid something. It is formed by attaching 「ようにする」 to the dictionary form of a verb, or its negative form. When used with the potential form of a verb, it signifies an effort to gain the ability to do something. It can also be combined with adjective stems or nouns followed by 「になる」 to indicate an effort to bring about a certain state or condition. The nuance of 「ようにする」 is that of a deliberate and purposeful approach, highlighting the speaker's active resolve to manage their actions or circumstances. It implies that the action is not a one-time occurrence but a consistent endeavor, often aimed at habit formation or continuous improvement. For example, 「毎日 日本語 を 勉強 する ようにしています」 (I make sure to study Japanese every day) conveys a commitment to a regular study routine. When used with a negative verb, such as 「～ないようにする」, it means to make a conscious effort to **avoid** doing something. For instance, 「遅刻 しない ようにします」 (I will make sure not to be late) signifies a deliberate attempt to prevent lateness. The term 「よう」 comes from the kanji 「様」, meaning 'manner' or 'way,' which further reinforces the idea of undertaking an action in a specific, goal-oriented manner.",
