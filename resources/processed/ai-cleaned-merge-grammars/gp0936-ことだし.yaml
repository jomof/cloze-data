        "[Noun] + ことだし": "Indicates a reason or justification, implying other unstated reasons as well.",

    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "General use, applicable in various contexts.",
        "function": "Connects a preceding clause (a reason) to a subsequent one (a suggestion, invitation, or determination), implying that the stated reason is sufficient among other unmentioned reasons.",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes that the stated reason is not the sole factor, but it is enough to warrant the following action or conclusion. It subtly suggests a broader context of motivations or factors contributing to the situation.",
        "grammatical-role": "Conjunctive phrase"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことだし」 is derived from 「こと」 (thing, matter, fact), 「だ」 (copula), and 「し」 (a conjunctive particle used to list reasons). The 「こと」 nominalizes the preceding phrase, 「だ」 asserts it, and 「し」 adds the nuance that this is one of several reasons.",
    "writeup": "「ことだし」 combines the noun 「こと」 ('thing'), the auxiliary verb 「だ」, and the conjunctive particle 「し」. It is employed to articulate reasons, often translating simply as \"because (A)\" or \"since (A),\" but critically, it emphasizes that there are other unstated reasons contributing to the situation. This structure can follow any word in its attributive form, or a noun when appended with 「の」. Similar to the standard usage of 「し」 in listing, this grammar point indicates that the stated reason (A) is not the sole factor. The implication is that while other reasons exist, reason (A) alone is sufficient to justify action (B). Action (B) typically takes the form of a suggestion, an invitation, or an expression of firm determination. It can be used across various registers, from casual conversation to more formal settings.",
