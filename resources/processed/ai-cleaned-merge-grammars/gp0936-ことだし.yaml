    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことだし」 is derived from 「こと」 (thing, matter, fact), 「だ」 (copula), and 「し」 (a conjunctive particle used to list reasons). The 「こと」 nominalizes the preceding phrase, 「だ」 asserts it, and 「し」 adds the nuance that this is one of several reasons.",
    "writeup": "「ことだし」 combines the noun 「こと」 ('thing'), the auxiliary verb 「だ」, and the conjunctive particle 「し」. It is employed to articulate reasons, often translating simply as \"because (A)\" or \"since (A),\" but critically, it emphasizes that there are other unstated reasons contributing to the situation. This structure can follow any word in its attributive form, or a noun when appended with 「の」. Similar to the standard usage of 「し」 in listing, this grammar point indicates that the stated reason (A) is not the sole factor. The implication is that while other reasons exist, reason (A) alone is sufficient to justify action (B). Action (B) typically takes the form of a suggestion, an invitation, or an expression of firm determination.",

            "japanese": "せっかく 君 の お父さん と お母さん が 来る {ことだし} 、 どっか いい 焼肉 屋 さん に でも 行こう 。",
            "english": "Since your father and mother are coming all the way, let's go to a nice yakiniku restaurant.",
            "scene": "A woman suggesting a plan to her male partner because his parents are visiting.",
            "scene_rationale": [
                {
                    "competing_grammar": "お父さんとお母さんが来るから、どっかいい焼肉屋さんにでも行こう。",
                    "mitigation": "The nuance of 「ことだし」 implies that their arrival is one of several unstated reasons for going to a nice restaurant (e.g., to make a good impression, it's a special occasion), which the scene highlights through the female speaker's initiative in suggesting a plan for her partner's family."
                }

            "setting": "friendly",
            "speaker_gender": "female",
            "listener_gender": "male",
            "nuance": "The use of 「～行こう」 is gender-neutral, but when spoken by a female to a male partner in a casual context, it implies a shared decision or suggestion, rather than a command. The specific mention of 「君のお父さんとお母さん」 highlights the family relationship context, which can often influence the politeness and directness of the conversation, especially when a woman is speaking to her male partner about his family."

                    "mitigation": "The scene implies that while good weather is a direct cause, the use of 「ことだし」 suggests other underlying reasons for the outing, such as a desire for group activity or simply enjoying the day. This provides a fuller justification than a simple 「から」."
