    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことだし」 is composed of 「こと」 (thing, matter, fact), 「だ」 (copula), and 「し」 (a particle used to list reasons). Essentially, it signifies that 'since this is the case, and there are other reasons too...'",
    "writeup": "「ことだし」 combines the noun 「こと」 ('thing,' 'matter'), the copula 「だ」, and the conjunctive particle 「し」, and is used to present a reason while implying that there are other reasons as well. It translates to \"because (A)\" or \"since (A),\" but it emphasizes that there are more reasons than just the one mentioned. The basic structure is '[Attributive form of a word] + ことだし' or '[Noun + の] + ことだし'. The particle 「し」 indicates that (A) is not the only reason. The implication is, \"while there are other reasons, (A) is good enough to (B).\" (B) is often a suggestion, invitation, or expression of determination.",
