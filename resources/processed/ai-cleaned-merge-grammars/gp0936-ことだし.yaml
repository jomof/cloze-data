        "usage-context": "General use, applicable in various contexts, from casual to formal.",
        "function": "Connects a preceding clause (a reason) to a subsequent one (a suggestion, invitation, or determination), implying that the stated reason is sufficient among other unmentioned reasons.",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes that the stated reason is not the sole factor, but it is enough to warrant the following action or conclusion. It subtly suggests a broader context of motivations or factors contributing to the situation.",
        "grammatical-role": "Conjunctive phrase"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことだし」 is derived from 「こと」 (thing, matter, fact), 「だ」 (copula), and 「し」 (a conjunctive particle used to list reasons). The 「こと」 nominalizes the preceding phrase, 「だ」 asserts it, and 「し」 adds the nuance that this is one of several reasons, implying that the stated reason is one among a broader set of contributing factors.",
    "writeup": "「ことだし」 combines the noun 「こと」 ('thing'), the auxiliary verb 「だ」, and the conjunctive particle 「し」. It is employed to articulate reasons, often translating simply as \"because (A)\" or \"since (A),\" but critically, it emphasizes that there are other unstated reasons contributing to the situation. This structure can follow verbs or adjectives in their plain forms, or nouns followed by 「の」 or 「である」. Similar to the standard usage of 「し」 in listing, this grammar point indicates that the stated reason (A) is not the sole factor. The implication is that while other reasons exist, reason (A) alone is sufficient to justify action (B). Action (B) typically takes the form of a suggestion, an an invitation, or an expression of firm determination. It can be used across various registers, from casual conversation to more formal settings, adapting its nuance based on the context and preceding word.",

            "kind": "similar expression",

            "term": "～ので",
            "meaning": "Because, since (polite)",

        {
            "term": "～のことだから",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While similar in conveying \"knowing X\", 「～のことだから」 implies a direct causal link between X's known characteristic and the outcome. In contrast, 「ことだし」 suggests X's characteristic is one of many reasons leading to the outcome, feeling less definitive about the causal chain."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「ことだし」 shares meaning with other causal conjunctions like 「から」 and 「ので」, its core nuance lies in implying that the stated reason is **one among several unmentioned reasons**. 「から」 and 「ので」 typically present a single, direct cause for an action or conclusion. Similarly, 「～のことだから」, while indicating an expectation based on someone's known character, focuses on that specific characteristic as the direct cause. In contrast, 「ことだし」 subtly suggests a broader context of motivations or factors contributing to the situation, making it suitable for gentle suggestions or when providing a sufficient, but not exhaustive, justification.",
