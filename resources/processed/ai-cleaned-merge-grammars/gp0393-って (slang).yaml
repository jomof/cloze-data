    "etymology": "The particle 「って」 is a colloquial contraction of 「とは」, where 「と」 is the quotation particle and 「は」 is the topic marker. Over time, its use expanded from quoting to also marking topics directly, especially in casual speech.",
    "writeup": "「って」 is a versatile particle primarily used in spoken Japanese as a casual substitute for the topic marker 「は」. It carries the nuance of \"as for\" or \"speaking of.\" It's important to note that this usage is informal and should be reserved for casual conversations. Think of it as a more relaxed way to introduce a topic compared to the more formal 「は」. Be cautious using 「って」 in formal settings.",
