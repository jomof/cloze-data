    "writeup": "「って」 is a versatile particle primarily used in spoken Japanese as a casual substitute for the topic marker 「は」. It carries the nuance of \"as for\" or \"speaking of.\" It's important to note that this usage is informal and should be reserved for casual conversations. Think of it as a more relaxed way to introduce a topic compared to the more formal 「は」. Be cautious using 「って」 in formal settings, though it can appear in semi-formal contexts when combined with polite language. It is generally used when the speaker wants to highlight or introduce a subject in a conversational, often emphatic, manner.",
