    "writeup": "**において** and **における** are formal expressions used to indicate location, time, situation, or context. Think of them as meaning \"in,\" \"on,\" \"at,\" or \"regarding.\" They are often used in formal writing and speech, such as academic papers, news reports, and business presentations.\n\n*   **において** typically follows a noun and indicates the place, time, or situation where something happens.\n*   **における** is used to modify another noun, specifying the scope or context. It's similar to saying \"in terms of\" or \"regarding the.\"\n\nThese expressions are generally considered more formal than simpler alternatives like **で** or **に**, so it's best to use them in appropriate settings.\n\nThe kanji 「於」 means \"at, in, on, as for,\" giving において and における a broad range of applications.",
