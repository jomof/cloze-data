    "etymology": "This grammar point combines 「は」 (the topic marker), 「の」 (the possessive particle), and 「一つ」 (one). The construction literally means \"is one of.\" 「一つ」 is a standard counter, and other appropriate counters can be used in its place to count people, objects, etc.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「は〜の一つだ」 is used to express that something is one of many within a larger category. Here's how it works:\n\n*   **(A) + は:**  Identifies the specific item or concept you are talking about.\n*   **(B) + の一つだ:** Specifies the larger category to which (A) belongs, indicating that (A) is just one member of that group.\n\n「一つ」 is a general counter, but you can substitute it with more specific counters like 「一人」 for people or 「一本」 for long, cylindrical objects, depending on what you're counting. For instance, when talking about people, 「一人」 (hitori) is more appropriate. When discussing items, use a counter like 「個」, 「本」, 「枚」, or similar, depending on the noun.",
