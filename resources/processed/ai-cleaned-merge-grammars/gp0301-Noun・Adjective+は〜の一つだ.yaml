    "etymology": "The grammar point is constructed from 「〜は」 (topic marker), 「〜の一つ」 (one of ~), and 「だ」 (copula). 「一つ」 is a counter for general objects, and 「〜の一つだ」 indicates that something is one of many within a larger group or category.",
    "writeup": "To express that something is one of many within a larger category, use the pattern **Noun/Adjective + は + Category + の一つだ**. This indicates that the noun or adjective belongs to a broader group.  「一つ」 here acts as a counter, but other counters can be used if more appropriate (e.g., 「一人」 for people, 「一種」 for types).",
