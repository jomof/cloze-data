  jlpt: N5
  details:
    part-of-speech: particle
    register: casual
    particle-syntactic-function: quotative
    particle-pragmatic-function: discourse marker
    usage-context: casual language
    function: To convey reported speech or thought informally
    nuance: Emphasizes a casual, direct, or informal relay of information.
    colocation: Often used with verbs like 言う (to say), 思う (to think), 聞く (to hear), 書く (to write).
  etymology: The particle 「って」 is a colloquial contraction of 「と」, the standard quotation particle. This
    type of abbreviation is common in casual speech to simplify and speed up communication. Its evolution
    reflects a natural tendency in language to shorten frequently used constructions for efficiency, particularly
    in informal settings.
  writeup: "「って」 is a versatile particle primarily used as a casual alternative to the more formal quotation\
    \ particle 「と」. It acts like a casual marker for reported speech or thought, often conveying a sense\
    \ of \"they said...\" or \"I heard that...\" without needing to explicitly state the verb of communication.\
    \ This makes conversation flow more naturally and quickly among friends and family.\n\nWhile its primary\
    \ function is to mark direct or indirect quotations, 「って」 can also be used to: \n*   **Express what\
    \ one heard or gathered**: Similar to \"I heard that...\" or \"apparently...\".\n*   **Report one's\
    \ own thoughts or decisions**: Especially when these thoughts are presented as if being 'quoted' from\
    \ oneself.\n*   **Convey information from inanimate sources**: Like a sign or a book \"saying\" something.\n\
    *   **Emphasize a point or question**: Adding a nuance of \"what do you mean by...?\" or \"you mean\
    \ to say...?\"\n\nIt's important to remember that because 「って」 is very casual, it might sound out of\
    \ place in highly formal or polite conversations, particularly when followed by highly polite forms\
    \ like 「です」 or 「ます」 directly. However, in friendly, but still polite, situations, such as between a\
    \ senpai and kouhai, this usage is perfectly normal and common. In extremely casual settings, the verb\
    \ following 「って」 can even be entirely omitted, relying on context for understanding."
  false_friends:
    - term: と (quotation)
      meaning: Quotation
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: Unlike 「って」, 「と」 is the standard quotation particle, more formal and suitable for written
        language and formal speech. It does not carry the same casual, immediate feel as 「って」.
      grammar_point: と (quotation)
    - term: といってもいい (you could say)
      meaning: You could say, You might say
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: Unlike 「って」, which is used to quote direct statements or thoughts, 「といってもいい」 is used to provide
        an alternative way of describing something, offering a possible interpretation, or making a concession.
      grammar_point: といってもいい (you could say)
    - term: んだって・だって (I heard)
      meaning: I heard that, He or She said that
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While both convey information heard from someone else, 「んだって」 often implies the information
        is new, surprising, or being relayed as hearsay. 「って」, on the other hand, can be a more direct and
        casual report of what was said, without necessarily implying surprise or novelty.
      grammar_point: んだって・だって (I heard)
    - term: とのこと
      meaning: It is said that, I am told that
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「とのこと」 is a more formal and indirect way of reporting information, often used in professional
        or public announcements. It implies the information was officially conveyed or heard from a reliable
        source. 「って」 is for personal, informal reports.
      grammar_point: <suggest>:とのこと (it is said that)
    - term: らしい
      meaning: It seems, apparently
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「らしい」 indicates that something is apparently true based on what one has heard or observed,
        but it carries a nuance of inference or conjecture. 「って」 is used for directly quoting or casually
        reporting something that was actually said or thought.
      grammar_point: らしい (I hear, it seems)
    - term: だって
      meaning: I heard that; He/She said that
      kind: often confused with
      nuance: While 「って」 is a general casual quotation marker that can imply something was heard, 「だって」
        specifically implies information received from a third party, often with a sense of 'they said'
        or 'because...'
      grammar_point: だって (even, too)
  post_false_friends_writeup: When using 「って」, remember it's a shortened, casual form of 「と」. When deciding
    which to use, consider the formality of the situation. If you're writing an essay or speaking to your
    boss, stick with 「と」. Use 「って」 with friends and family. As for 「といってもいい」 and 「んだって」, make sure you are
    using them in the correct context; the former suggests an alternative description or a concession, whereas
    the latter means 'I heard that...' often with a nuance of new information. 「とのこと」 is more formal and
    used for official reports, while 「らしい」 implies inference rather than direct quotation. Additionally,
    while 「って」 can imply information heard from others, 「だって」 explicitly functions as a marker for information
    received from a third party, or it can introduce a reason in a casual tone.

      scene: A person is planning an outing and asks a friend about their schedule.
      register: casual

            - ここ は 駐車 禁止 {だ} よ。
          english: This place is no parking.

          english: I see, I understood that kind of thing. (More formal)
          hint: 「とわかった」 is a more formal or explanatory way to state understanding. 「ってわかった」 emphasizes

            We're looking for a casual expression of a sudden realization.
        - competing_japanese:
            - なる ほど、{分かっ た}！

          english: Mom says not to stay out late. (More formal)
          hint: While 「と」 is grammatically correct, 「って」 is more common for children relaying a parent's
            direct instruction or warning informally. We're looking for a casual way to relay a direct command
            from a parent.
        - competing_japanese:
            - お 母 さん に 夜 遅く まで 遊 ば ない {よう に} 言わ れ た。
          english: I was told by my mom not to play late.
          hint: This is a passive construction, often more formal or indirect. 「って言うんだ」 is a direct and
            casual report, putting the emphasis on what the mother explicitly said. We're looking for a
            direct report of the warning.
      scene: A child explaining to a friend why they have to go home early, relaying their mother's strict
        instruction.

      setting: apologetic
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: male
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: The use of 「って」 with 「言う ん だ」 (or 「言ってる」) is very natural for a child reporting a parent's
        direct instruction or warning, especially the informal 「遊 ん じゃ ダメ」. The 「 ん だ」 adds an explanatory
        tone, justifying why they must leave.

          english: Did you hear that Ms. Tanaka is getting married? (Formal)
          hint: This is a more formal and polite way of asking. 「って？」 is extremely casual, used among close
            acquaintances to ask for confirmation of information heard informally. We're looking for a casual
            way to ask for confirmation.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 田中 さん 結婚 する {らしい} よ。
          english: Apparently, Ms. Tanaka is getting married.
          hint: 「らしい」 implies hearsay or observation, but is a statement of information rather than a question
            seeking confirmation from the listener. 「って？」 directly asks for confirmation. We're looking
            for a question about what was heard.
      scene: Two colleagues gossiping casually during a coffee break.
      register: casual
      setting: interrogative
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: The interrogative use of 「って？」 (with a rising intonation) is very common in casual speech
        to confirm information that one has heard or to express surprise. It acts as a shortcut for "Did
        you hear that...?" or "Is it true that...?".

          english: He complained that his homework was too much. (Standard quotation)
          hint: While 「と」 is grammatically correct for reporting speech, 「って」 makes the complaint sound
            more immediate and exasperated, reflecting the casual nature of the grievance. We're looking
            for a casual report of a complaint.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 宿題 が 多 すぎ て 困っ た {と} 言っ た。
          english: He said he was troubled because his homework was too much.
          hint: This is a more verbose and indirect way of stating the problem. 「って」 directly quotes the
            complaint, conveying its core message efficiently. We're looking for a direct, casual report
            of the complaint itself.
      scene: A student expressing frustration about his workload to a friend.
      register: casual
      setting: humorous
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: male
      nuance: Using 「って」 to report a complaint like 「多すぎる」 (too much) lends a direct, almost theatrical
        feel to the reported speech, as if mimicking the speaker's tone. It's typical for relaying grievances
        in an informal setting.

          english: My older sister said she needs new clothes for the trip. (Standard quotation)
          hint: 「と」 is standard. 「って」, especially with the omitted verb of saying, conveys a quick, casual
            relay of information, common when talking about family members. We're looking for a casual,
            concise report.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 姉 は 旅行 に 新しい 服 が 必要 {らしい}。
          english: Apparently, my older sister needs new clothes for the trip.
          hint: 「らしい」 implies hearsay or observation, but not a direct quote. 「って」 reports what was directly
            stated or conveyed. We're looking for a direct report of what your sister said.
      scene: Someone telling their friend about their older sister's preparations for a trip.
      register: casual
      setting: informative
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: The omission of the verb after 「って」 is very common when casually relaying information about
        family members or close acquaintances. 「新しい 服 が 必要 だ」 is a direct statement of need, reinforcing
        the straightforward report.

          english: I heard that restaurant is super popular. (More formal)
          hint: 「と聞いた」 is a more direct and formal way to state having heard something. 「って」 is commonly
            used for general hearsay or rumors in casual conversation. We're looking for a casual way to
            report popular opinion.
        - competing_japanese:
            - あの レストラン は すごく 人気 が ある {らしい}。
          english: Apparently, that restaurant is very popular.
          hint: 「らしい」 implies the information is based on appearances or reports, but it often carries a
            nuance of inference. 「って」 directly quotes the sentiment or general talk. We're looking for a
            casual relay of common knowledge or talk.
      scene: Two friends discussing where to go for dinner.
      register: casual
      setting: friendly
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: Using 「って」 to report common knowledge or rumors, especially with adjectives like 「人気 が ある」
        (popular), is natural in casual settings. The casual tone is maintained by omitting the verb of
        hearing, common in spoken Japanese.

          english: He said he would call me back later. (Standard quotation)
          hint: 「と」 is the standard particle. 「って」 is more casual and direct, making the report sound like
            a quick relay of the message received. We're looking for a casual, succinct report of a message.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 は 後 で 電話 する {予定 だ} {と} 言っ て い た。
          english: He said he plans to call back later.
          hint: This adds the nuance of a plan, making it more detailed. 「って」 is simpler and more immediate,
            focusing directly on the content of the message. We're looking for a direct, simple report.
      scene: A person relaying a message from a friend to another friend.
      register: casual
      setting: informative
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: This example shows 「って」 used to concisely relay a simple message or promise, often omitting
        the second person pronoun in the quoted part as it's understood from context. It's a very common
        casual usage.

  jlpt: N3
  details:
    part-of-speech: phrase
    register: casual
    usage-context: Common in very casual conversation, especially among younger speakers.
    function: Functions as a colloquial quotation marker, or to introduce a concept or description in an
      informal manner.
    nuance: Carries a very casual, often colloquial, and sometimes abrupt tone. It is an extreme abbreviation,
      signaling a relaxed and informal speech style. The variant 'っつ' may imply a slight pause or a frustrated
      tone, though this is not always the case.
  etymology: 「つ」 originates from an abbreviation of 「という」. 「という」 is composed of the quotation particle 「と」
    and the verb 「言う (いう)」 (to say). Over time, 「という」 was shortened to 「つ」 in very casual speech.
  writeup: The grammar pattern 「つ」 is a highly abbreviated, slang form of 「という」. It is used to quote something
    that was previously stated, to refer to something that is known as (A), or to mention something that
    is called (A). Fundamentally, 「という」 is a combination of the quotation particle 「と」 and the verb 「言う」
    (to say). Due to 「と」 being a quotation particle, 「つ」 maintains the versatility to follow almost any
    word or statement, functioning as a flexible conversational connector. Despite being strong slang, 「つ」
    is very common in modern Japanese, particularly in casual conversation among friends or peers. While
    native speakers often abbreviate 「という」 to varying degrees, 「つ」 represents the shortest possible form.
    Other common abbreviated forms include 「って」 and 「っつ」, and sometimes even 「つう」. It is crucial to remember
    that even though the verb 「言う」 is omitted in 「つ」, the grammar point can still be conjugated. For instance,
    to express past tense, you would use 「つった」 (from 「言った」), and for the progressive form, 「つってん」 (from
    「言っている」, abbreviated to 「言ってん」). Understanding these conjugated forms is essential for natural usage.
  false_friends:
    - term: って
      meaning: Casual quotation marker; said; heard; regarding
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: Both `つ` and `って` are casual quotation markers derived from `という`. However, `つ` is a *more
        extreme and specific* abbreviation used primarily for "said that" or "called", often indicating
        extreme casualness or even brusqueness. `って` is a broader, more commonly used casual particle with
        a wider range of functions beyond just quoting, such as topic marking or indicating means.
      grammar_point: って (quotation marker・casual)
    - term: という
      meaning: Called; named; known as; as much as
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: '`という` is the complete and grammatically correct form for quoting, defining, or naming. `つ`
        is a highly informal, slang abbreviation of `という`, suitable only for very casual speech and often
        perceived as rough or abrupt compared to the standard `という`.'
      grammar_point: という (naming and definition)
    - term: そうだ
      meaning: I heard that; It is said that
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: '`そうだ` conveys reported information or what one has heard, focusing on the source of information.
        `つ` (from `という`) focuses on the *act* of saying or calling something, or what something *is called*,
        often without explicitly stating the source, and is highly casual.'
      grammar_point: そうだ (hear that)
    - term: らしい
      meaning: I hear that; It is said that
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: '`らしい` conveys information based on observation or what has been heard, implying a strong
        likelihood or typicality. While `つ` also relates to what is ''said'', it is a direct colloquial
        abbreviation of `という` for direct quotation or naming, not a general inference based on hearsay.'
      grammar_point: らしい (I hear, it seems)
  post_false_friends_writeup: While all these expressions relate to conveying information, `つ` is a highly
    abbreviated, slang form specifically derived from `という` (to say/be called). It implies a direct quote
    or a label, often with a casual or even blunt tone. `って` is a broader casual particle, also deriving
    from `という` but used more widely for casual quoting, topic marking, or indicating means, and is generally
    less abrupt than `つ`. In contrast, `そうだ` (hear that) explicitly focuses on reporting information heard
    from a source, and `らしい` (I hear, it seems) conveys an impression or strong likelihood based on observation
    or indirect information. When using `つ`, consider the very informal context and its specific implication
    of direct quotation or naming, distinct from general hearsay or inference.

          english: Even if you said that, I didn't hear it.
          hint: The additional 'って' here gives a 'even if' nuance, implying that the speaker *did* say it
            but it wasn't heard, whereas the original is simply asking 'what did you say?'
      scene: A young man asking his friend to repeat something he didn't quite catch.
      register: casual
      setting: interrogative
      conjugation: past plain (～た)
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: male
      nuance: The use of 「おい」 and the informal 「なんてつった」 (a colloquial contraction of 「何と言った」) makes this
        very casual and direct, typical between close male friends.
    - english: What on earth is that guy talking about?
      japanese:

            - あいつ、何 か 問題 {つ} ってん の か？
          english: Is he saying there's some problem?
          hint: This implies someone is *reporting* a problem using `つってん`. The original is asking what
            *incomprehensible* thing the person is saying, reflecting exasperation.
      scene: A young woman expressing irritation about someone's incomprehensible remarks to her friend.

      setting: serious
      conjugation: progressive (～ている)
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: 「あいつ」 is a very informal and slightly derogatory way to refer to someone. 「何つってんのさ」 is a casual,
        frustrated form of 「何と言っているの」, with 「さ」 adding a dismissive or exasperated tone often used by women.

          hint: This uses `つった` as part of a noun clause, focusing on *forgetting* the content of what was

          hint: Here, `つって` is used reflexively, indicating the person *calls himself* a 'weirdo'. The original

          english: That's why I'm saying this is no good, I've been saying it all along!
          hint: This uses `つ` for the direct quote, but then follows it with `ずっと言ってる` to emphasize repeated
            past action. The original `つってんのよ` is a more compressed and exasperated form implying a current
            state of repeating.

      register: casual
      setting: commanding
      conjugation: progressive (～ている)
      speaker_gender: female
      nuance: The phrase 「つってんのよ」 (a shortened form of 「と言っているのよ」) uses the female-associated sentence-ending
        particle 「よ」 in conjunction with the informal 「つってん」, expressing a strong, frustrated assertion
        commonly heard from women.

          english: If you wear such strange clothes, you don't know what others will say.
          hint: This emphasizes the *consequences* of others' reactions. The original simply states the
            outcome (standing out) directly from the action of wearing.
      scene: A man warning his younger brother about his eccentric fashion choices before a casual gathering.
      register: casual
      setting: friendly
      conjugation: conditional (～たら)
      speaker_gender: male
      nuance: The use of 「つったら」 (a contracted form of 「と言ったら」) implies 'if you were to call such clothes...'
        or 'if you were to wear such clothes...'. The casualness of the abbreviation reflects the friendly
        but direct warning from a male speaker to his younger brother, emphasizing the blunt truth about
        standing out.

            - 『行き たく ない』{つ}った けど、行か ない わけ に は いか ない よ ね。
          english: I said I don't want to go, but I can't not go, can I?
          hint: This uses `つった` as a premise for a reluctant acceptance, highlighting a common real-life
            scenario. The original is a firm refusal.
      scene: A teenage girl vehemently refusing to attend a family gathering, speaking to her mother.
      register: casual
      setting: serious
      conjugation: past plain (～た)
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: 「つった でしょ」 is a very emphatic and slightly exasperated way of saying 「と言ったでしょう」, common in
        casual, frustrated female speech. The 「でしょ」 at the end seeks confirmation, implying "you know I
        said that, so why are you still pushing?"
    - english: The 'new product' they were talking about is actually just an updated version.
      japanese:
        - 『新 商品』{つ} の が、結局 マイナー チェンジ だっ た ん だ よ な。
        - あの『新 商品』{つ} の、ただ の 改良 版 らしい よ。
        - まさ か、『新 商品』{つ} の が そう と は 思わ なかっ た。
      english_literally: '''New product'' (that is called), in the end, was just a minor change, you know.'
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 『新 商品』{つ} の なら、もっと 驚き が 欲しかっ た な。
          english: If it's called a 'new product', I would have wanted more of a surprise.
          hint: This uses `つ` to refer to the labeling, implying expectation. The original states the disappointment
            after the fact.
      scene: Two friends discussing a recently released item they were anticipating.
      register: casual
      setting: informative
      conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
      speaker_gender: male
      nuance: 「新 商品つのが」 is an extremely casual and slightly dismissive way of referring to something that
        was "called" or "said to be" a new product. 「つのが」 is a contracted form of 「というものが」, implying "that
        thing called...", often with a hint of irony or disappointment.
    - english: If you call that a 'plan', you're wrong.
      japanese:
        - あんな の『計画』{つ} ったら、笑わ れる よ。
        - それ『計画』{つ} ったら、みんな びっくり する よ。
        - その 案 を『計画』{つ} ったら、無理 が ある よ。
      english_literally: That kind of thing, if you call it 'plan', you'll be laughed at.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 『計画』{つ} って も、これ じゃあ 誰 も 納得 し ない だろ う な。
          english: Even if you call it a 'plan', no one will be convinced by this.
          hint: This uses `つっても` (a more emphatic 'even if you say') to challenge the validity of the label.
            The original warns of being laughed at for the labeling.
      scene: A university student scolding his friend's poor ideas.
      register: casual
      setting: serious
      conjugation: conditional (～たら)
      speaker_gender: male
      nuance: 「計画つったら」 (from 計画と言ったら) highlights the speaker's disbelief or disapproval of something being
        labeled a 'plan'. The casual nature of 「つったら」 emphasizes the speaker's directness and bluntness,
        typical among close friends.
    - english: He's not a 'genius' or anything, he just works hard.
      japanese:
        - 彼 は『天才』{つ} う か、ただ の 努力 家 だ よ。
        - あの 人 は『天才』{つ} う より、根気 が ある 人 だ ね。
        - 『天才』{つ} う か、彼 は 地道 な 努力 の 人 だ と 思う な。
      english_literally: He is 'genius' called or, just a hard worker.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 の 努力 は『天才』{つ} って 呼ぶ に 値 する よ。
          english: His effort is worth calling 'genius'.
          hint: This example uses `つって呼ぶ` (call X Y) to affirm the label based on effort. The original uses
            `つうか` to correct a potential misunderstanding of the label.
      scene: A mentor explaining a successful person's true nature to a mentee.
      register: casual
      setting: informative
      conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
      speaker_gender: female
      nuance: 「天才つうか」 is a very casual expression meaning "rather than calling him a genius" or "it's not
        so much a genius as...". It uses the `XというよりY` structure in a slangy, abbreviated form, often when
        the speaker is correcting a misconception. The 「か」 often implies clarification or an alternative
        perspective.
    - english: He said, 'I'm busy,' and left immediately.
      japanese:
        - 彼 は『忙しい』{つ} すぐ 帰っ て いっ た。
        - 『今日 は 忙しい』{つ} 席 を 立っ て しまっ た。
      english_literally: He, 'I'm busy' saying (abbreviated), immediately left.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 は『忙しい』{つ} って 連絡 も なし に 帰っ た ん だ。
          english: He said 'I'm busy' and went home without contacting anyone.
          hint: This uses `つって` to convey the reported speech and then adds a negative action that follows.
            The original simply reports the statement and immediate departure.
      scene: Observing a person who quickly departed after stating their reason.
      register: casual
      setting: informative
      conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
      nuance: The direct use of 「忙しいつすぐ」 (short for 「忙しいと言ってすぐに」) indicates a quick, almost abrupt report
        of someone's words and subsequent action, emphasizing the swiftness or lack of elaborate explanation.
        This implies the speaker is simply relaying the sequence of events without embellishment.
    - english: Even if it's something called 'common sense', it might not be common sense in another country.
      japanese:
        - 『常識』{つ}った ところ で、他 の 国 で は 常識 じゃ ない こと も ある。
        - 『当たり前』{つ}った ところ で、人 に よっ て 違う ん だ よ ね。
      english_literally: '''Common sense'' (that is called), even if (it is said), in other countries, it
        might not be common sense.'
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 『常識』{つ}った から と いっ て、みんな が そう だ と は 限ら ない よ。
          english: Just because it's called 'common sense' doesn't mean everyone thinks so.
          hint: This uses `つったからといって` (just because you call it...) to challenge the universality of the
            concept. The original uses `つったところで` (even if you call it...) to state a general truth about
            cultural differences.
      scene: Discussing cultural differences in a relaxed conversation among friends.
      register: casual
      setting: academic
      conjugation: conditional (～たら)
      nuance: 「常識つった ところ で」 (from 「常識と言ったところで」) uses 「つった」 to frame "common sense" as a label or concept
        that might not hold universally. The casual abbreviation makes the observation feel more conversational
        and less formal, typically used when pointing out a discrepancy or challenging a general assumption.
  post_example_writeup: Even though 「言う」 disappears when abbreviated to 「つ」, it is vital to remember that
    standard conjugation rules still apply. For instance, if you wish to convey past tense, you would use
    「つった」。 Similarly, for the progressive form, 「つってん」 is used, which is derived from 「言っている」 shortened
    to 「言ってん」.
