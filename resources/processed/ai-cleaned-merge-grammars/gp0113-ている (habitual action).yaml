    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ている」 is composed of 「て」, the te-form of a verb, and 「いる」, which means \"to exist.\" Historically, this structure signified \"to be in the state of having completed an action.\" Over time, its meaning broadened to encompass actions currently in progress and, as seen here, habitual or repetitive actions. The core concept remains that of \"existing in a particular state\"—in this case, the state of repeatedly performing an action. This evolution allows 「ている」 to convey ongoing existence, completion leading to a state, or persistent activity, all stemming from the fundamental meaning of 「いる」.",
    "writeup": "The 「ている」 form is essential for expressing actions that occur repeatedly or habitually over an extended period. This differs from a single, ongoing action, focusing instead on activities that are routine or consistent, such as daily commutes, hobbies, or regular work routines. It truly conveys the sense of \"doing [verb] regularly\" or \"being in the habit of doing [verb].\n\nTo emphasize the habitual nature of the action, you will frequently find 「ている」 used with expressions of time such as **毎日** (every day), **毎晩** (every night), **毎週** (every week), **いつも** (always), or **普段** (usually). This grammatical structure highlights that the action is a consistent part of someone's life or a regular occurrence.\n\nWhile 「ている」 is a plain form, it can be made polite by changing 「いる」 to 「います」, as in 「〜ています」. The nuance of habituality remains consistent across both plain and polite forms.\n\n**A Note on Contraction:** In very casual speech or writing, especially in regional dialects or manga, 「ている」 may often be contracted to 「てる」. For instance, **読んでいる** (yonde iru - reading) might become **読んでる** (yonderu). This contraction applies to all tenses of this form.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The 「ている」 form signifying habitual action emphasizes that an action is performed repeatedly and regularly as part of a routine or a person's characteristic behavior. This is distinct from plain or polite verb forms (e.g., 「読む」, 「読みます」), which merely state a general fact or a one-time event without conveying the element of repetition. For instance, while 「彼は本を読みます」 simply means 'He reads books,' 「彼は本を読んでいます」 implies 'He habitually reads books' or 'He is a book reader.' When linking sequential actions without implying a habitual meaning, the simple 「て」 form is used to connect verbs.",
