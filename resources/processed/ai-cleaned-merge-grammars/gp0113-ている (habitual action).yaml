    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ている」 is composed of 「て」, the te-form of a verb, and 「いる」, which means \"to exist.\" When combined, it literally translates to \"existing in the state of [verb],\" but is used to describe actions that are ongoing or habitual.",
    "writeup": "The 「ている」 form indicates the repetition of common activities, things that happen so often that they are considered continuous (like going to work, having a hobby, etc.). Due to 「いる」 being one of the verbs for \"existing\" in Japanese, the 「ている」 form is closer to \"continuing to exist in a specific state,\" rather than simply \"(A)~ing\" in English.\n\nIn this construction, it can be thought of as \"to be existing in the state of performing a regular activity\".\n\n**Important Considerations**\n*   To make it easier to understand, expressions of time are often used with this meaning of 「ている」. This can be things like 「毎日」 (every day), 「毎晩」 (every night), 「毎週」 (every week), and similar phrases.\n*   **Fun Fact**: Regularly in novels, manga, and specifically some parts of Japan, 「とる」 may be used instead of 「ている」 with the same meaning.",
