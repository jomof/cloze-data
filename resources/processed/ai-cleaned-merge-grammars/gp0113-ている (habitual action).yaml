    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ている」 is composed of 「て」, the te-form of a verb, and 「いる」, which means \"to exist.\" When combined, it literally translates to \"existing in the state of [verb],\" but is used to describe actions that are ongoing or habitual.",
    "writeup": "The 「ている」 form is used to describe actions that occur repeatedly or habitually over a period of time. This differs from a single, ongoing action, focusing instead on activities that are routine or continuous by nature, such as daily commutes, hobbies, or regular work.\n\nWhile the literal translation might suggest \"being in the state of [verb]-ing,\" for habitual actions, it conveys the sense of \"doing [verb] regularly\" or \"being in the habit of doing [verb].\"\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   Expressions of time such as 「毎日」(every day), 「毎晩」(every night), 「毎週」(every week), 「いつも」(always), or 「普段」(usually) are frequently used with 「ている」 to emphasize the habitual nature of the action.\n*   This construction highlights that the action is a consistent part of someone's life or a regular occurrence.\n\n**Fun Fact:** In some regions of Japan and in more casual contexts like novels or manga, 「とる」 or 「とります」 may be used as a contracted form of 「ている」 or 「ています」, respectively. For example, 「読んでいる」 might become 「読んどる」.",
