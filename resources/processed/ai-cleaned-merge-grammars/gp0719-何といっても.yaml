    },
    "etymology": "The expression 何といっても is derived from 何 (nani, \"what\"), と (to, quotative particle), 言う (iu, \"to say\"), and the particle も (mo, \"even\"). The literal breakdown translates to \"even if one says what,\" implying that regardless of other considerations, the following statement holds true.",
    "writeup": "**何といっても (nanto ittemo)** is an expression that emphasizes a particular point or aspect as paramount, conveying the sense of \"no matter what else is said\" or \"by any account.\" Its construction combines 何 (what), と言う (to say), and the particle も (even), literally meaning \"even if one says anything.\" This phrase is predominantly used at the beginning of a sentence to highlight a key factor, often a positive attribute. While its primary usage leans towards emphasizing positive aspects, it can, albeit less commonly, introduce a negative nuance. It is generally used in standard discourse and is not restricted by specific age groups, genders, or regions.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene emphasizes the speaker is highlighting the *single most important* reason for popularity, which is better conveyed by the emphatic '何といっても' rather than a mere statement of fact for a simple statement of reason does not suffice in this context, where the emphasis on the most prominent reason is key. The scene is about emphasizing the overriding reason for popularity, making '何といっても' the most suitable choice over a simple statement of fact."

                    "mitigation": "The scene suggests the speaker is trying to pinpoint the *ultimate* reason for his likeability. '何といっても' serves to elevate this quality above all others, which a simple statement of reason does not. A straightforward statement of reason lacks the emphatic quality desired in this context, where a particular trait is highlighted as the most significant."

'何といっても' serves to elevate this skill above all other considerations. A simple statement of certainty like '間違いなく' does not convey the same sense of an overriding, undeniable quality that '何といっても' does, especially when balancing a positive against a negative trait."

'何といっても' conveys this conclusive, overriding highlight more strongly than simply '一番のおすすめ'.

The use of 「じゃ」 is typical of older male speech and implies a sense of seasoned advice. 「何といっても」 emphasizes the hot springs as the definitive best aspect, imparting a strong recommendation based on experience."

'何といっても' highlights this dominant characteristic more effectively than 'とにかく', which can be more general. While 'とにかく' (anyway/at any rate) can convey emphasis, '何といっても' specifically pinpoints the single most overriding reason for the recommendation, making it more persuasive in this context where affordability is the ultimate selling point."
