    "etymology": "The expression 何といっても is derived from 何 (nani, \"what\"), と (to, quotative particle), 言う (iu, \"to say\"), and the particle も (mo, \"even\"). The literal breakdown translates to \"even if one says what,\" implying that regardless of other considerations, the following statement holds true.",
    "writeup": "**何といっても (nanto ittemo)** is an expression that emphasizes a particular point or aspect as paramount, conveying the sense of \"no matter what else is said\" or \"by any account.\" Its construction combines 何 (what), と言う (to say), and the particle も (even), literally meaning \"even if one says anything.\" This phrase is predominantly used at the beginning of a sentence to highlight a key factor, often a positive attribute. While its primary usage leans towards emphasizing positive aspects, it can, albeit less commonly, introduce a negative nuance. It is generally used in standard discourse and is not restricted by specific age groups, genders, or regions.",
