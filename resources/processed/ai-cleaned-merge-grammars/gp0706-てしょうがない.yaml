    "etymology": "This expression is an abbreviation of 「仕方（しかた）がない」, which literally means \"there is no way/method.\" Over time, the 「仕方」 part was shortened to 「しょう」 in casual speech. The underlying idea is that the feeling or situation is so intense that nothing can be done about it.",
    "writeup": "「てしょうがない」 is a common colloquial expression used to convey that something \"cannot be helped\" or is \"extremely\" the case. It's essentially a shortened version of 「仕方（しかた）がない」, a phrase indicating there's no way to deal with a situation. The 「しょう」 is simply a more casual pronunciation of 「仕様」. \n\nThe meaning implies that the extent of something is so overwhelming it cannot be overlooked or avoided. It follows the て-form of verbs, い-adjectives, or the で-form of な-adjectives.\n\nWhile 「仕方（しかた）がない」 can also be used, 「てしょうがない」 is more common in everyday conversation. The former is traditionally considered slightly more polite and might appear more frequently in literature.",
