    "etymology": "This expression is an abbreviation of 「仕方（しかた）がない」, which literally means \"there is no way/method.\" Over time, the 「仕方」 part was shortened to 「しょう」 in casual speech. The underlying idea is that the feeling or situation is so intense that nothing can be done about it, implying an uncontrollable degree.",
    "writeup": "「てしょうがない」 is a common colloquial expression used to convey that something is \"extremely\" the case, or that a feeling or action \"cannot be helped\" due to its intensity. It is essentially a shortened and more casual version of 「仕方（しかた）がない」, with 「しょう」 being a relaxed pronunciation of 「仕様」 (meaning 'way' or 'method').\n\nThis grammar point emphasizes that the degree or extent of something is so overwhelming that it is unavoidable or cannot be ignored. It attaches to the **て-form of verbs** (including desiderative forms like 〜たい), the **て-form of い-adjectives**, and the **で-form of な-adjectives**.\n\nWhile 「仕方（しかた）がない」 carries the same meaning, 「てしょうがない」 is more prevalent in everyday, casual conversation. 「仕方がない」 is traditionally considered slightly more formal or polite and may be encountered more frequently in written contexts or more measured speech.",
