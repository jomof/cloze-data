    "etymology": "The phrase 「はおろか」 is derived from the archaic usage of the な-adjective 「おろか」 meaning 'foolish' or 'negligent'. Although 「おろか」 itself isn't commonly used as a standalone adjective in modern Japanese, the phrase 「はおろか」 retains the nuance of 'completely setting aside' something to highlight the obviousness of a subsequent point.",
    "writeup": "「はおろか」 functions similarly to 「はもちろん」, meaning \"of course (A), but (B)\". While 「おろか」 as a standalone な-adjective means \"negligent\" or \"alienation,\" its modern usage is mainly confined to set expressions. 「はおろか」 conveys the idea of \"completely putting aside (A), (B)\", implying that if (B) is true, then (A) is even more so.\n\nCommon translations include \"let alone (A), (B)\" and \"it's needless to say that (A), when (B)\". (A) and (B) typically belong to the same category, with (B) being more obvious. Often, (B) is followed by an adverbial particle like 「さえ」, 「も」, 「すら」, or 「まで」, emphasizing (B) as the noteworthy minimum extent.\n\nIn essence, 「はおろか」 highlights that if something is true for the less obvious case (B), it's even **more** true for the obvious case (A). Sentences using 「はおろか」 often carry a negative nuance.",

            "meaning": "Needless to say; it goes without saying",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike はおろか which often implies a negative or extreme state where even a basic action is impossible (let alone a more difficult one), は言うまでもなく is more neutral or positive, stating that something is so obvious it doesn't need to be said."

            "nuance": "Similar to は言うまでもなく, but more formal. While はおろか focuses on a 'let alone' situation, often with a sense of impossibility or difficulty, は言うに及ばず simply indicates that something is self-evident, making further mention unnecessary."

However, はもちろん implies a logical progression ('A is true, and B is also true'). はおろか, by contrast, implies 'A is true, and B (the more basic/obvious one) is *even* true', often highlighting a surprising or extreme state."

            "nuance": "A formal equivalent of だけでなく. Similar to だけでなく, it lacks the 'let alone' nuance and often negative implication found in はおろか. It just adds information without emphasizing the extreme nature of the preceding item."

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The expressions discussed above, such as は言うまでもなく, はもちろん, and だけでなく, convey similar ideas of inclusion or obviousness but differ significantly in nuance from はおろか. While they might link related items, they generally lack the specific emphasis on an extreme or negative condition that characterizes はおろか. はおろか highlights that if even a basic or expected thing is true (or not true), then a more extreme or less expected thing is certainly true (or not true). Pay attention to the subtle implications of severity or obviousness conveyed by はおろか, which are often absent in these other phrases.",
