    "etymology": "The phrase 「はおろか」 is derived from the archaic usage of the な-adjective 「おろか」 meaning 'foolish' or 'negligent'. Although 「おろか」 itself isn't commonly used as a standalone adjective in modern Japanese, the phrase 「はおろか」 retains the nuance of 'completely setting aside' something to highlight the obviousness of a subsequent point.",
    "writeup": "「はおろか」 functions similarly to 「はもちろん」, meaning \"of course (A), but (B)\". While 「おろか」 as a standalone な-adjective means \"negligent\" or \"alienation,\" its modern usage is mainly confined to set expressions. 「はおろか」 conveys the idea of \"completely putting aside (A), (B)\", implying that if (B) is true, then (A) is even more so.\n\nCommon translations include \"let alone (A), (B)\" and \"it's needless to say that (A), when (B)\". (A) and (B) typically belong to the same category, with (B) being more obvious. Often, (B) is followed by an adverbial particle like 「さえ」, 「も」, 「すら」, or 「まで」, emphasizing (B) as the noteworthy minimum extent.\n\nIn essence, 「はおろか」 highlights that if something is true for the less obvious case (B), it's even *more* true for the obvious case (A). Sentences using 「はおろか」 often carry a negative nuance.",
