    "etymology": "The term 「おろか」 itself is an archaic な-adjective meaning 'foolish' or 'stupid.' The 「は」 adds emphasis, creating the nuance that something is so obvious it's almost foolish to mention.",
    "writeup": "「はおろか」 is used to express that if something is true of one thing, it's even more so of another, often more obvious or extreme, thing. It's similar to 「はもちろん」 ('of course A, but B'). The word 「おろか」 alone means 'negligent' or 'alienation', but it's mostly used in set expressions now. 「はおろか」 means 'completely putting aside (A), (B)'. Common translations include \"let alone (A), (B)\" and \"it's needless to say that (A), when (B)\". (B) and (A) should be related, with (B) being more obvious. Because of this obviousness, (B) is often followed by 「さえ」 to show that (B) is the minimum noteworthy extent. Other particles like 「も」, 「すら」, or 「まで」 can also be used. 「はおろか」 sentences usually have a negative nuance.",
