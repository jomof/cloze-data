    "etymology": "The grammar point is constructed from the volitional form of a verb (う/よう) expressing intent, followed by the verb 「思う(おもう)」, meaning 'to think'. Together, they convey the idea of 'thinking of doing something' or 'intending to do something'.",
    "writeup": "The structure 「Verb[volitional-よう]+と思う」 is a common expression indicating the speaker's intention or decision to do something. It's similar to saying \"I think I will...\" or \"I'm going to...\" in English. \n\nThe 「volitional-よう」 form expresses the speaker's will or intent. When combined with 「と思う」, it signifies that the speaker has made a decision or formed an intention. This is close in meaning to 「〜するつもりだ」 ('to intend to do').\n\n「思っている」 can be used in place of 「思う」 to indicate that the intention is something the speaker has been considering for some time. This can also be used for describing the intentions of another person.",
