    "writeup": "The structure Verb[volitional-form] + と思う expresses the speaker's intention or decision to do something. It's similar to saying \"I think I will...\" or \"I'm going to...\" in English. It indicates a plan or intention that has been formed in the speaker's mind. It's a very common and versatile expression in Japanese, suitable for everyday conversations. It is often used with 思っている (omotteiru) to express an ongoing intention.",
