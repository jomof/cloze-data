    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てみる」 is composed of the te-form of a verb, indicating an action or state, followed by 「みる」 (miru), which means \"to see\" or \"to try.\" The combination implies the idea of \"trying something to see what happens\" or \"trying something out.\"",
    "writeup": "To express trying something, pair the te-form of a verb with 「みる」. It's written in hiragana. The meaning is closer to \"do A, and see what the result is.\" This is typically used when trying something for the first time. This phrase can also suggest someone else tries something, using 「てみて」 or the more formal 「てみてください」. In very casual speech, 「てみ」 might be used, with the nuance of \"just give it a go!\". When 「てみた」 is in the past tense, it implies the attempt was successful unless stated otherwise. Writing 「見る」 in kanji stresses the \"see\" meaning, potentially causing misunderstanding.",
