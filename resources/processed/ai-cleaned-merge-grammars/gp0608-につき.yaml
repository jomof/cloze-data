    "etymology": "The grammar point 「につき」 comes from 「に」 (a particle indicating location, time, or reason) and the conjunctive form (連用形) of the verb 「就く」 (つく), which means \"to take up\" or \"to assume.\" The original meaning of 「就く」 implies taking up a position or role. Therefore, 「につき」 retains a sense of being directly linked or attached to something.",
    "writeup": "「につき」 is a formal grammar point primarily used in written Japanese and formal announcements. It combines 「に」 and the conjunctive form of the verb 「就く」 (to take up, to assume). While 「就く」 often refers to assuming a new position, 「につき」 conveys meanings such as \"due to,\" \"on account of,\" or \"for each.\" It directly follows a noun to explain a reason, cause, or rate. This grammar is frequently found in official documents and notifications due to its formality.",
