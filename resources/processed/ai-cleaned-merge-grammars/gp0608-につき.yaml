        "part-of-speech": "particle",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Typically used in formal written communications, public announcements, and official documents. It conveys a stiff or formal tone."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「につき」 comes from 「に」 (a particle indicating location, time, or reason) and the conjunctive form (連用形) of the verb 「就く」 (つく), which means \"to take up\" or \"to assume.\" The original meaning of 「就く」 implies taking up a position or role. Therefore, 「につき」 retains a sense of being directly linked or attached to something.",
    "writeup": "「につき」 is a formal grammar point primarily used in written Japanese and formal announcements. It combines 「に」 and the conjunctive form of the verb 「就く」 (to take up, to assume). While 「就く」 often refers to assuming a new position, 「につき」 conveys meanings such as \"due to,\" \"on account of,\" or \"for each.\" It directly follows a noun to explain a reason, cause, or rate. This grammar is frequently found in official documents and notifications due to its formality.",

            "setting": "informative",
            "nuance": "This is a very common usage of 「につき」 in public announcements, conveying a direct and official reason for a change in service. The term 「運行」 (unko) for operations and 「中止」 (chuushi) for suspension are formal terms appropriate for such announcements.",
            "etymology": "「運行」 (unko) literally means 'transport operation' or 'service operation'. 「中止」 (chuushi) means 'suspension' or 'cancellation'."

            "etymology": "「お 一人 様」 (o-hitori sama) is a polite form meaning 'one person'. 「一 回 限り」 (ikkai kagiri) means 'limited to one time'."

This phrasing is typical in academic or formal assessment settings.",
