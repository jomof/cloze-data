meaning: Indicates that an action or state did not occur in the past.

jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  usage-context: general use
etymology: The negative past tense is derived from the negative auxiliary verb ない, which itself originates
  from older forms like ぬ or ん. By attaching the past tense auxiliary た (which becomes かった when preceded
  by い, as ない ends in い), the construction なかった emerged. The polite form ませんでした developed from the negative
  polite form ません combined with the past auxiliary でした. This structure effectively combines the negation
  of an action with its completion in the past.
writeup: |-
  The negative past forms of verbs are used to express that an action or state did not occur in the past. There are three primary forms, applicable to both Godan (u-verbs) and Ichidan (ru-verbs):

  *   **Casual (～なかった)**: This form is created by taking the plain negative (～ない) form of a verb and replacing the final い with かった. For example, 食べる (taberu) becomes 食べない (tabenai), then 食べなかった (tabenakatta - didn't eat). Similarly, 飲む (nomu) becomes 飲まない (nomanai), then 飲まなかった (nomanakatta - didn't drink).

  *   **Semi-polite (～なかった です)**: This form builds upon the casual negative past by simply adding です. For instance, 食べなかったです or 飲まなかったです. While not strictly grammatically standard in traditional Japanese, it is widely used and accepted in modern colloquial Japanese, especially when speaking to someone you respect but with whom you have a somewhat close relationship.

  *   **Polite (～ませんでした)**: For the polite form, take the ます-stem of the verb (e.g., 食べます → 食べ, 飲みます → 飲み) and attach ませんでした. For example, 食べませんでした (tabemasen deshita - didn't eat) or 飲みませんでした (nomimasen deshita - didn't drink).

  An important exception to note is the verb ある (aru), which means "to exist" or "to be" for inanimate objects. Its casual past-negative form is simply なかった (nakatta), not あらなかった (aranakatta). However, its polite past-negative form follows the regular pattern: ありませんでした (arimasendeshita).
false_friends:
  - term: まだ～ていません
    meaning: have not done
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike the negative past tense for verbs, 「～ていません」 implies a state that began in the past
      and continues to the present, or an action that has not yet been completed. It focuses on the current
      state resulting from a past action, not merely the non-occurrence of an action in the past.
    grammar_point: まだ～ていない (still uncompleted)
  - term: 〜ませんでしたか
    meaning: Didn't you...?
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike the negative past tense for verbs which makes a statement, 「～ませんでしたか」 is a question
      asking if someone didn't do something. It implies seeking confirmation or expressing mild surprise.
    grammar_point: か (question)
  - term: い-Adjective (past negative)
    meaning: was not (i-adjective)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While structurally similar by ending in 「なかった」, this applies to i-adjectives to describe a
      past state of non-existence of that quality, not a past non-occurrence of an action performed by
      a verb.
    grammar_point: い-Adjective (past negative)
  - term: じゃなかった
    meaning: was not (noun/na-adjective)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This form is used to negate nouns or な-adjectives in the past tense. It describes a past state
      of being 'not something' or 'not a certain quality', rather than a past action that did not occur.
    grammar_point: じゃなかった (was not)
  - term: Verb[ない] (plain negative)
    meaning: Not (verb)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike the past negative, this form expresses a general non-action or non-existence in the
      present, or a future non-occurrence, rather than a specific non-occurrence in the past.
    grammar_point: Verb[ない] (plain negative)
post_false_friends_writeup: The distinction between these forms is crucial for precise communication.
  The primary grammar point, Verb[なかった] (past negative), states that an action definitively did not occur
  at a specific time in the past. In contrast, Verb[ない] (plain negative) functions as a general present
  negative or to express non-existence. 「～ていない」, while also negative, focuses on the *state* of not having
  completed an action up to the present moment, or an ongoing state of non-action. Furthermore, take care
  to distinguish statements using this grammar point from interrogative sentences using the form 「～ませんでしたか」.
  Lastly, forms like い-Adjective (past negative) (e.g., 寒くなかった - wasn't cold) and じゃなかった (e.g., 学生じゃなかった
  - wasn't a student) are used to negate past states of adjectives and nouns, respectively, demonstrating
  a common 「なかった」 ending but applied to different parts of speech.

  convey that an action did not take place at a specific point in the past. While 「〜なかった」 offers a direct
  and casual tone, 「〜ませんでした」 provides a polite alternative suitable for formal interactions. The semi-polite
  「〜なかったです」 serves as a flexible option in everyday conversation. Remember to distinguish these from expressions
  like 「〜ていない」, which indicate a state of not having completed an action up to the present, rather than
  a definitive past non-occurrence.
