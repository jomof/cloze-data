id: gp0056
meaning: did not do
pronunciation:
  katakana: ナカッタ
  romaji: nakatta
formation:
  Verb[ない form] + かった: This forms the plain past negative for verbs. Take the plain negative form of the
    verb (ending in ない) and replace the final い with かった.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The form なかった (nakatta) combines the negative auxiliary ない (nai) with the past tense auxiliary
  た (ta). Historically, ない evolved from なし (nashi), an archaic adjective meaning 'non-existent' or 'not
  present.' The かっ (katt) part comes from the adjectival stem なかっ when conjugating ない into its past form.
  Thus, it literally means 'was not present' or 'did not exist (for the verb),' highlighting its adjectival
  origin in Japanese grammar.
writeup: |-
  The なかった form is the plain past negative conjugation for verbs in Japanese. It signifies that an action or event did not occur in the past. This form is widely used in casual conversation and informal writing. It's essential for forming negative statements about past events without conveying a sense of politeness or formality.

  To form なかった, you take the plain negative form of a verb (the ない form) and replace the final い with かった. For example, 食べる (taberu, to eat) becomes 食べない (tabenai, not eat), and then 食べなかった (tabenakatta, did not eat). This pattern applies to all regular verbs.

  It's a declarative form, simply stating a fact about the past. Unlike polite forms, なかった doesn't convey any specific speaker-listener relationship beyond being informal. It's often used when speaking with friends, family, or in situations where politeness is not required. Understanding this basic past negative form is fundamental for constructing comprehensive sentences in Japanese.

  - term: Verb[ませんでした]
    meaning: did not do (polite past negative)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is the polite equivalent of なかった. While なかった is casual and used among friends or family,
      ませんでした は used in formal settings or when addressing someone of higher status, or simply to show
      general politeness.
    grammar_point: Verb[ませんでした] (polite past negative)
  - term: Verb[ていない]
    meaning: have not done / is not doing
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: なかった indicates a completed past non-action (e.g., 'I did not eat breakfast yesterday'). ていない
      indicates an ongoing state of non-action or a state that has not yet begun/completed (e.g., 'I haven't
      eaten breakfast yet' or 'I am not eating breakfast'). The time reference is crucial here. なかった is
      a definite past, while ていない often implies a continuation from the past up to the present, or an
      action that is currently not happening.
    grammar_point: Verb[ている・てる] (progressive・resultative)
  - term: ないでください
    meaning: please don't do
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: なかった is a declarative statement about something that did not happen. ないでください is a command
      or request to not do something. It's about future action or current cessation, not past non-occurrence.
    grammar_point: ないでください・ないで (please don't)
post_false_friends_writeup: While なかった marks a simple past non-occurrence, its politeness level sets it
  apart from ませんでした. Furthermore, distinguish なかった from forms like ていない (the negative form of ている). なかった
  confirms something did not happen in the past at a specific time. ていない typically indicates a state of
  not having done something yet (implying future potential) or currently not doing something. ないでください
  is a prohibition, a command for future action, whereas なかった simply states a past fact.

      for objective reporting or factual statements, especially when formality is conveyed by other elements
      of the sentence or discourse. Variations like 「のだ」 and 「のである」 can add an explanatory or more formal
      tone to the plain form, even when the verb itself remains casual.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how Verb[なかった] is used to state a simple past negative fact.
  Notice its versatility across various everyday situations, from personal reflections to casual conversations
  and even objective reporting. While the plain form is inherently informal, the overall context, including
  vocabulary and other particles, can influence the perceived politeness or formality of the sentence.
