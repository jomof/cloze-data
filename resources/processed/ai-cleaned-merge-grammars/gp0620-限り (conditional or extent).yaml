  usage-context: Defining a scope or condition under which something is true.
  function: Expresses limitations, conditions, or the extent of knowledge/information.
  nuance: Consistently underscores a boundary or constraint for the accompanying logic.
  grammatical-role: Connects clauses, indicating a condition or scope.
  logical-flow: Establishes a prerequisite or boundary for the subsequent statement.
  temporal-flow: Implies an ongoing condition or a point in time up to which something is valid.
  spatial-flow: Can imply a spatial boundary (e.g., as far as one can see), but primarily conceptual/conditional.
etymology: The grammar point 「限り」 is derived from the verb 「限る」 (かぎる), which means "to limit" or "to restrict."
  Its noun form 「限り」 retains this sense of limitation or boundary, indicating the scope or condition under
  which something is valid or true. Its various usages, from setting conditions to defining the extent
  of knowledge or a physical boundary, all stem from this core concept of limitation.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「限り」 (kagiri) is a versatile expression that conveys the idea of "as long as" or "while a certain condition is met," and "to the extent that." It emphasizes the **limitations** or **scope** within which something is true or valid.

  There are a few common ways 「限り」 is used:

  *   **As Long As (Conditional):** This signifies that as long as a certain state or condition persists, the accompanying statement holds true. For instance, 「彼 が 謝ら ない 限り」 (as long as he doesn't apologize), implies that a situation will remain unchanged until the condition is met.
  *   **To the Extent That (Scope of Information/Action):** This highlights that a statement is true within a specific scope of information or action. This often relates to sensory input, knowledge, or effort, such as 「私 が 知る 限り」 (as far as I know), 「見渡す 限り」 (as far as the eye can see), or 「力 の 限り」 (to the best of one's ability).

  While this form of 「限り」 focuses on ongoing conditions or the scope of something, it is important to distinguish it from the related grammar point 「限り (limited to)」 (gp0744). That grammar point specifically denotes a strict restriction, meaning "only for" or "restricted solely to" a particular item or group (e.g., 「今週 末 限り」 - limited to this weekend).
false_friends:
  - term: とは限らない
    meaning: Not necessarily so, is not always true, there is no guarantee that
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「限り」 which defines a condition or extent for something to be true, 「とは限らない」 indicates
      that something is not necessarily true or not always the case, expressing uncertainty.
    grammar_point: とは限らない (not necessarily)
  - term: からには
    meaning: As long as, since, given
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While similar in conditional meaning, 「からには」 implies a stronger sense of commitment or obligation
      arising from a given situation, whereas 「限り」 focuses more on the condition or scope itself.
    grammar_point: からには (since; obligation)
  - term: さえ〜ば
    meaning: If only…then, as long as..., provided..., only thing ... needs for ... is ...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「さえ〜ば」 emphasizes a specific, minimal condition necessary for a result, implying that if only
      that one thing is met, the outcome is guaranteed. 「限り」 describes a broader, often ongoing state
      or condition.
    grammar_point: さえ〜ば (if only; as long as)
  - term: に限る
    meaning: Nothing better than, there's nothing like, limited to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に限る」 suggests that something is the best or most preferable option, or that it applies only
      to a particular thing. In contrast, 「限り」 (this grammar point) defines the conditional scope or the
      extent of something, rather than indicating an exclusive preference or strict applicability to just
      one item.
    grammar_point: に限る (nothing better than)
  - term: 限り (limited to)
    meaning: Limited to, only for, restricted to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both expressions derive from 「限る」 (to limit), this grammar point 「限り (conditional or
      extent)」 broadly sets a condition or defines the full extent of something (e.g., as long as X is
      true, as far as one knows). In contrast, 「限り (limited to)」 specifically denotes an exclusive restriction,
      meaning 'only for' or 'restricted solely to' a particular item or group.
    grammar_point: 限り (limited to)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「限り」 (conditional or extent) sets an ongoing
  condition or defines the full scope of something. 「とは限らない」 expresses uncertainty. 「からには」 implies obligation
  or resolve based on a situation. 「さえ〜ば」 highlights a single necessary condition for an outcome. 「に限る」
  expresses preference or strict limitation. The distinct 「限り (limited to)」 emphasizes exclusive restriction
  to a specific item or group.
examples:
  - english: As long as you are a student, you should prioritize your studies.
    japanese:
      - 学生 で ある {限り}、学業 を 最 優先 す べき です。
      - 学生 で ある {限り} は、勉強 を まず 第 一 に し なさい。
      - 学生 の {限り}、勉強 する の が 当たり前 だ よ。
    english_literally: As long as you are a student, studies should be highest priority.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 学生 の {間 は}、学業 を 最 優先 す べき です。
        english: While you are a student, you should prioritize your studies.
        hint: 「間は」 emphasizes a duration of time during which an action or state continues. 「限り」 focuses
          on a condition or a defining state that establishes a boundary. We're looking for an expression
          that links an obligation to an inherent state of being.
    scene: A university professor giving advice to their students.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The standard polite form uses 「最 優先 す べき です」. Adding 「は」 after 「限り」 (限り は) can slightly emphasize
      the condition. The casual variant 「学生 の 限り」 omits 「で ある」 and is common in more informal settings,
      implying that being a student is the inherent condition. The phrase 「勉強 を まず 第一 に し なさい」 is a more
      direct, instructive way to express prioritization.
  - english: As far as I investigated, the cause of the accident was speeding.
    japanese:
      - 私 が 調べ た {限り} で は、事故 の 原因 は スピード 違反 でし た。
      - 私 の 調べ た {限り} で は、事故 の 原因 は スピード の 出し 過ぎ だっ た よう です。
      - 僕 の 調べ た {限り}、事故 の 原因 は スピード 違反 だっ た よ。
    english_literally: As far as I investigated, the cause of the accident was speeding.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 が 調べ た {所 で は}、事故 の 原因 は スピード 違反 でし た。
        english: According to the place I investigated, the cause of the accident was speeding.
        hint: 「所では」 refers to 'according to the place where X happened' or 'according to what was found
          at the site.' 「限りでは」 indicates 'as far as one's knowledge or investigation extends.' We're looking
          for an expression that limits the scope of information based on one's personal investigation.
    scene: A police officer reporting findings from an accident investigation.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: 「私 が 調べ た 限り で は」 is the standard formal expression. 「私 の 調べ た 限り で は」 is also common and
      natural. The third variant, using the masculine pronoun 「僕」 and the casual ending 「だっ た よ」, makes
      it suitable for a male speaker in an informal context. 「スピード の 出し過ぎ」 is a more colloquial way to
      say 'excessive speeding' compared to 「スピード 違反」.
  - english: As long as he doesn't apologize, I have no intention of forgiving him.
    japanese:
      - 彼 が 謝ら ない {限り}、私 は 許す つもり は あり ませ ん。
      - 彼 が 謝ら ない {限り} は、私 は 許す 気 に なれ ませ ん。
      - あいつ が 謝ら ない {限り}、絶対 許さ ない。
    english_literally: As long as he doesn't apologize, I have no intention to forgive.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が 謝る {まで}、私 は 許す つもり は あり ませ ん。
        english: Until he apologizes, I have no intention of forgiving him.
        hint: 「まで」 indicates an endpoint or a point up to which something continues. 「限り」 expresses a
          continuous condition; as long as that condition holds, the other action or state persists. We're
          looking for an expression that signifies a sustained stance contingent on an ongoing state.
    scene: A woman expressing her strong stance in a personal dispute.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The first variant is a standard, polite negative statement. Adding 「は」 after 「限り」 (限り は) subtly
      emphasizes the conditional boundary. 「許す 気 に なれ ませ ん」 expresses a lack of willingness or feeling,
      which can be softer than saying "no intention." The third variant is very casual and forceful, using
      「あいつ」 (a derogatory term for 'that guy') and the strong negative 「絶対 許さ ない」, suitable for expressing
      strong anger or resolve from a female speaker.
  - english: As long as I am alive, I will continue to protect you.
    japanese:
      - 私 が 生き て いる {限り}、あなた を 守り 続け ます。
      - 俺 が 生き て いる {限り}、お前 を 守り 続ける。
      - 私 が 生き て いる {限り} は、あなた を 守る よ。
    english_literally: As long as I am living, I will continue to protect you.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 が 生き て いる {間 は}、あなた を 守り 続け ます。
        english: While I am alive, I will continue to protect you.
        hint: 「間は」 signifies a duration or period of time. 「限り」 implies a strong, inherent condition or
          boundary. We're looking for an expression that expresses a profound, unconditional promise linked
          to one's very existence.
    scene: A parent making a profound promise to their child during a difficult time.
    register: shitashii kuchō (intimate)
    setting: supportive
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The first variant is polite and can be used by anyone. The second variant, using 「俺 が」 (a
      masculine pronoun) and 「お前 を」 (a familiar, often masculine, pronoun for 'you'), combined with the
      direct 「守り 続ける」, conveys a strong, protective commitment typical of male speech in an intimate setting.
      The third variant, with 「私」 and the softer 「守る よ」, is a gentle yet firm promise suitable for female
      or generally softer intimate speech. The addition of 「は」 after 「限り」 slightly emphasizes the condition
      of being alive.
  - english: As long as this project is successful, the budget increase will be approved.
    japanese:
      - この プロジェクト が 成功 する {限り}、予算 の 増額 は 許可 さ れ ます。
      - この プロジェクト が 成功 する {限り} は、予算 の 増額 は 承認 さ れる でしょう。
      - この プロジェクト が うまく いっ て いる {限り}、予算 を 増やす の は 問題 ない はず だ。
    english_literally: As long as this project is successful, budget increase will be approved.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この プロジェクト が 成功 {すれ ば}、予算 の 増額 は 許可 さ れ ます。
        english: If this project succeeds, the budget increase will be approved.
        hint: 「すれば」 indicates a simple conditional 'if A, then B.' 「限り」 implies that an action or state
          will continue as long as a specific condition or state persists. We're looking for an expression
          that implies ongoing approval contingent on sustained success.
    scene: A manager discussing conditional budget approval with a team leader.
    register: formal
    setting: negotiating
    nuance: The first Japanese variant is standard formal business language. Adding 「は」 after 「限り」 (限り
      は) can emphasize the condition for approval. 「承認 さ れる でしょう」 uses a softer, more predictive tone.
      The third variant is more casual, replacing 「成功 する」 with the colloquial 「うまく いっ て いる」 (going well)
      and using a less formal, but confident, ending with 「問題 ない はず だ」 (should be no problem).
  - english: As far as I can see, there's no one around here.
    japanese:
      - 見渡す {限り}、ここ に は 誰 も い ない。
      - 見渡す {限り}、人 っ子 ひとり 見当たり ませ ん。
      - 周り を 見る {限り}、誰 も い ない な。
    english_literally: As far as overlooking, here no one exists.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{見渡せ ば}、ここ に は 誰 も い ない。'
        english: If I look around, there's no one here.
        hint: 「見渡せ ば」 implies a simple conditional 'if I do this action'. 「見渡す 限り」 emphasizes the entire
          scope of what can be seen as the condition for the statement. We're looking for a phrase that
          sets the limit of one's perception.
    scene: A hiker alone in a vast, quiet natural landscape.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: 「見渡す 限り」 is a common idiomatic expression for 'as far as the eye can see.' 「人っ子ひとり」 is a more
      emphatic way to say 'not a single person' and is used with the polite 「見当たり ませ ん」. The third variant
      uses the more direct 「周り を 見る」 and the casual male sentence-ending particle 「な」, making it sound
      like an internal thought or a casual observation to oneself.
  - english: As long as there's a possibility, I won't give up.
    japanese:
      - 可能 性 が ある {限り}、私 は 諦め ませ ん。
      - 可能 性 が 少し で も ある {限り} は、私 は 諦め ない。
      - 可能 性 が ある {限り}、絶対 に 諦め て は いけ ませ ん。
    english_literally: Possibility exists as long as, I will not give up.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 可能 性 が {あれ ば}、私 は 諦め ませ ん。
        english: If there's a possibility, I won't give up.
        hint: 「あれば」 is a simple conditional 'if'. 「限り」 emphasizes that the condition is continuous and
          as long as it exists, the action will not cease. We're looking for an expression that signifies
          a sustained commitment contingent on an ongoing condition.
    scene: A coach motivating a team after a setback.
    register: formal
    setting: inspirational
    nuance: 「可能 性 が ある 限り」 is a frequently used phrase to express unwavering determination. Adding 「少し
      で も」 emphasizes even the smallest possibility. The polite 「諦め ませ ん」 conveys general politeness,
      while the casual 「諦め ない」 is more direct. The third variant, 「絶対 に 諦め て は いけ ませ ん」, uses strong,
      prescriptive language, implying that giving up is absolutely forbidden, often used in a motivational
      or instructive context.
  - english: I'll do my best to the extent of my ability.
    japanese:
      - 私 の 力 の {限り}、頑張り ます。
      - できる {限り} の こと は やり ます。
      - 力 の {限り} 尽くし ます。
    english_literally: My strength's limit, I will do my best.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 最大 限 に 頑張り ます。
        english: I will do my maximum best.
        hint: 「最大 限 に」 is an adverb simply meaning "to the maximum extent." 「力 の 限り」 implies utilizing
          one's strength to its very limit or boundary, emphasizing the effort itself. We're looking for
          a phrase that specifically refers to the full extent of one's capacity.
    scene: An employee assuring their manager about a challenging task.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「力 の 限り」 is a formal and dedicated expression meaning 'to the utmost of one's strength/ability.'
      「頑張り ます」 is a common polite verb for 'to do one's best.' 「できる 限り の こと は やり ます」 is a very common,
      slightly more colloquial phrase that expresses doing everything within one's power. 「尽くし ます」 is
      a more formal and literary verb for 'to exert completely' or 'to devote oneself fully'.
  - english: As long as it's a living creature, it has to eat.
    japanese:
      - 生物 で ある {限り}、食べ なけれ ば なら ない。
      - 生物 で ある {限り} は、食べる の が 必須 だ。
      - 生き物 で ある {限り}、食う の は 当たり前 だろ。
    english_literally: Living creature as long as, must eat.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 生物 {なら}、食べ なけれ ば なら ない。
        english: If it's a living creature, it has to eat.
        hint: 「なら」 sets a simple condition. 「限り」 emphasizes an inherent, fundamental nature or universal
          truth that defines the condition.
    scene: A biologist explaining fundamental laws of nature.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The phrase 「生物 で ある 限り」 emphasizes the inherent nature of living beings. The use of 「である」
      makes it a formal and universal statement, suitable for academic or scientific contexts. Adding
      「は」 after 「限り」 in the second variant emphasizes the given condition. The third variant uses the
      more casual 「生き物」 for 'living thing' and 「食う」 for 'eat', along with the male casual ending 「だろ」,
      making it a very informal observation.
  - english: As long as there is an opportunity, I will keep trying.
    japanese:
      - 機会 が ある {限り}、挑戦 し 続け ます。
      - 機会 が ある {限り} は、挑み 続け ます。
      - チャンス が ある {限り}、俺 は 諦め ない！
    english_literally: Opportunity exists as long as, will continue to challenge.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 機会 が {あれ ば}、挑戦 し 続け ます。
        english: If there is an opportunity, I will keep trying.
        hint: 「あれば」 is a simple conditional. 「限り」 implies a sustained effort as long as the condition
          continuously holds. We're looking for an expression that signifies ongoing determination dependent
          on a continuous state.
    scene: A determined person encouraging themselves after facing repeated setbacks.
    register: casual
    setting: inspirational
    nuance: The phrase 「機会 が ある 限り」 signifies continued action as long as the possibility exists. It conveys
      a strong sense of perseverance and commitment. Adding 「は」 after 「限り」 in the second variant adds
      a slight emphasis. The third variant uses the more colloquial 「チャンス」 (chance) and the masculine
      「俺」, ending with a strong, determined 「諦め ない！」 (I won't give up!), suitable for a highly motivated
      male speaker.
post_example_writeup: The examples showcase how 「限り」 defines the boundaries or conditions under which
  a statement holds true, covering various uses from personal ability to general truths. Pay close attention
  to the context and what word or phrase precedes 「限り」 to grasp its precise nuance in each situation.
