    "etymology": "The particle が originally indicated the subject of a sentence but evolved to also express contrast or connection between clauses. It's derived from the verb 'あり' (ari), meaning 'to be,' and retains a subtle sense of highlighting the preceding clause while introducing a contrast.",
    "writeup": "The particle が has several uses, all sharing the theme of highlighting the preceding clause while introducing additional information. As 'but' or 'however', が connects two clauses, indicating a contrast or slight opposition. It's used directly after verbs and い-adjectives. With nouns and な-adjectives, it requires a form of だ (である or です) before it. While conveying contrast, が is considered more formal and direct than other conjunctions such as けど. Sometimes, a sentence ends with が, implying that further information exists but is obvious. Be mindful that が is versatile and context-dependent.",
