details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: casual
  function: To add emphasis, indicate a minimum condition, or imply exclusion.
  nuance: 「さえ」 can convey surprise that even a certain item or condition is included, or it can specify
    a minimal condition that, if met, is sufficient for something else to occur. It often carries a stronger
    emphasis than 「も」.
etymology: The origin of 「さえ」 is thought to be related to the verb 添える (そえる - soeru), meaning "to add
  to" or "to accompany." Over time, the meaning evolved from simply adding something to emphasizing the
  inclusion of even an extreme or minimal item. This core concept of "adding on" or "including" is key
  to its various uses, whether it's "even this" or "this much is sufficient," setting a baseline or highlighting
  an unexpected presence.
writeup: |-
  The particle 「さえ」 is a versatile particle that adds nuance to sentences, primarily functioning in two main ways: to emphasize the inclusion of something surprising or extreme, and to express a minimal condition for something to occur.

  When used for **emphasis**, 「さえ」 means "even" and typically highlights an unexpected or extreme example. This usage often appears in negative sentences to underscore the complete absence of something, implying "not even this minimal thing exists." For instance, if you say 「子供 さえ 分かる」, it implies that the concept is so simple that "even a child can understand it," thereby emphasizing its simplicity.

  The second primary function of 「さえ」 is to set a **minimal condition**, translating to "if only" or "as long as." In this context, it usually combines with conditional forms like 「〜ば」 or 「〜たら」 (e.g., 「〜さえ〜ば」 or 「〜さえ〜たら」). This construction implies that if a stated minimal condition is met, a certain outcome will follow. For example, 「お金 さえ あれば、買える」 means "If only I had money, I could buy it," indicating that money is the sole necessary condition.
false_friends:
  - term: も
    meaning: also; even
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「も」 is a general additive particle, indicating "also" or "even" without the strong emphasis
      on extremity or minimum condition that 「さえ」 carries. 「さえ」 often implies that something else is true
      or will happen given the stated condition.
    grammar_point: も (addition or emphasis particle)
  - term: だけ
    meaning: only; just
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だけ」 simply limits something to a certain extent. 「さえ」, while also limiting, adds the nuance
      of "even something as minimal as this" or "even something as surprising as this."
    grammar_point: だけ (only・just)
  - term: すら
    meaning: even (literary, strong negative nuance)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「すら」 is a more formal and often carries a stronger, sometimes negative, nuance than 「さえ」,
      especially when implying that even a minimal thing isn't possible or happened unexpectedly. It's
      often used in literary or more dramatic contexts.
    grammar_point: すら (even)
  - term: まで
    meaning: even to the extent; until
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「まで」 can mean "even" in the sense of including something up to a certain limit or extent.
      While similar to 「さえ」 in conveying "even X", 「さえ」 specifically highlights X as a surprising or minimal
      example, whereas 「まで」 often implies a progression or a point reached.
    grammar_point: まで (even to the extent)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「さえ」 is most distinctive in its use to express a minimal condition ("if only"
  / "as long as"). While 「も」, 「だけ」, 「すら」, and 「まで」 can all express forms of "even" or limitation, 「さえ」
  often implies a subsequent consequence that relies on that minimal condition, or highlights the unexpected
  nature of what is included. Pay close attention to whether the particle is emphasizing an extreme example
  or setting a baseline for something else to occur.
examples:
  - english: Even a child can understand this.
    japanese:
      - '{子供 さえ} これ が 分かる。'
      - 子供 さえ これ が 分かり ます。
      - 子供 さえ これ が 分かっ ちゃう。
    english_literally: Even a child, this, understands.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 子供 も これ が 分かる。
        english: A child also understands this.
        hint: While 「も」 can mean "also" or "even", 「さえ」 adds a stronger emphasis, highlighting the surprising
          or minimal nature of the subject. We're emphasizing that this is so easy, even a child gets
          it.
    scene: A teacher explaining a very simple concept.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「子供さえ」 emphasizes that even someone as seemingly unqualified as a child can understand it,
      implying it's very simple. The phrase does not have gender-specific or age-specific Japanese elements,
      but the context implies the speaker is an adult talking about a child.
  - english: He didn't even say goodbye.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は {さようなら さえ} 言わ なかっ た。
      - 彼 は さようなら さえ 言い ませ ん でし た。
      - あいつ は さようなら さえ 言わ なかっ た ん だ。
    english_literally: He, goodbye even, did not say.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は さよう なら も 言わ なかっ た。
        english: He also did not say goodbye.
        hint: 「も」 is more neutral. 「さえ」 provides a stronger sense of surprise or disappointment that even
          the most basic courtesy was omitted. We're stressing the lack of even a simple goodbye.
    scene: Someone left abruptly, causing disappointment.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: Here, 「さえ」 stresses the lack of even the most basic courtesy of saying goodbye, highlighting
      the speaker's disappointment or surprise at the extreme omission.
  - english: There isn't even a single person here.
    japanese:
      - ここ に は {一人 さえ} い ませ ん。
      - ここ に は 一人 さえ い ない。

    english_literally: Here, one person even, is not present.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ここ に は 一人 も い ませ ん。
        english: There isn't even one person here.
        hint: Both 「一人さえ」 and 「一人も」 can express "not even one person". However, 「さえ」 often implies a stronger
          sense of unexpected emptiness or a more surprising lack. We want to emphasize the complete absence,
          even of a minimal number.
    scene: Arriving at a place that was expected to be busy, but finding it completely deserted.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「さえ」 with a negative verb emphasizes the complete absence, noting that not even the smallest
      number (one person) is present, implying an unexpected level of emptiness.
  - english: If only I had money, I could buy it.
    japanese:
      - '{お 金 さえ} あれ ば、それ が 買える の に。'

      - 金 さえ あれ ば、それ 買えん の に。

      - competing_japanese:
          - お 金 が あれ ば、それ が 買える の に。
        english: If I had money, I could buy it.
        hint: While 「が」 simply marks the subject, 「さえ」 emphasizes that money is the minimal and sufficient
          condition. We're highlighting that money is the *only* thing needed.
    scene: A person looking at an expensive item they really want but cannot afford.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: 「お金さえあれば」 emphasizes that money is the sole necessary condition to achieve the desire. The
      「さえ」 combined with 「あれば」 (conditional form of ある) underscores that if this minimal condition is
      met, the outcome follows.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 努力 すれ ば、できる よ。
        english: If you try, you can do it.
        hint: Adding 「さえ」 emphasizes that *just* trying is the key, simplifying the condition to the bare
          minimum. We want to stress that effort is the crucial factor.
    scene: A coach giving encouragement to an athlete who is feeling discouraged.
    register: casual
    setting: supportive
    nuance: 「努力しさえすれば」 highlights that simply making an effort (努力する) is the minimal and sufficient requirement
      for success. The 「し」 here is the ます-stem of する, forming a common phrase with 「さえ」 to mean "if only
      one does X".

        english: Simple things are also sometimes difficult for me.
        hint: 「も」 is more generalized. 「さえ」 adds a nuance of surprise or unexpected difficulty, emphasizing
          that even the simplest things pose a challenge. We're highlighting the surprising nature of
          the difficulty.
    scene: A student struggling with a basic task, reflecting on their own abilities.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「簡単なことさえ」 emphasizes that even tasks considered easy by others can be challenging for the

        english: He also couldn't speak because he was tired.
        hint: While 「も」 indicates 'also couldn't', 「さえ」 strongly emphasizes that the speaker was so exhausted

    register: casual

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あなた が いれ ば、他 に 何 も いら ない。
        english: If you are here, nothing else is needed.

      everything else unimportant. The 「で」 here functions to connect the noun 「あなた」 to the state of being,
      which is then emphasized by 「さえ」.
  - english: He even forgot that.

      - 彼 は {それ さえ} 忘れ て しまっ た。

    english_literally: He, that even, ended up forgetting.

          - 彼 は それ も 忘れ て しまっ た。
        english: He also forgot that.

          him forgetting even this specific thing.
    scene: Two friends discussing someone's recent forgetfulness, implying it's becoming a problem.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「それさえ」 implies that "that" was something important or basic, and forgetting it is surprising
      or concerning, perhaps hinting at a higher level of forgetfulness than expected.

    japanese:
      - '{連絡 し て さえ} くれれ ば、すぐ に 行く から。'

          - 連絡 し て くれれ ば、すぐ に 行く から。
        english: If you contact me, I will come right away.
        hint: Adding 「さえ」 emphasizes that simply making contact is the minimal and sufficient action for
          the speaker to come. We want to stress that nothing more than contacting is needed.
    scene: A person assuring a worried friend that they are always available to help.
    register: casual
    setting: supportive
    conjugation: conditional (～ば)
    nuance: 「連絡してさえくれれば」 implies that mere contact (連絡する - to contact) is the sufficient and only required
      action for the speaker to come. The 「〜てさえくれれば」 structure shows that the speaker is willing to act
      based on this minimal condition.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 「さえ」 powerfully emphasizes either a surprising
  inclusion or a bare minimum condition. When it marks a minimal condition, it is almost always paired
  with a conditional form like 「〜ば」 or 「〜たら」, reinforcing the idea of "if only this one thing happens."
  Understanding this dual function will greatly improve your ability to use 「さえ」 naturally.
