etymology: The term 『やつ』 (yatsu) has a fascinating linguistic journey. Historically, it can be traced
  back to the character 『奴』, which has connotations of 'slave' or 'servant.' Over time, its usage broadened
  to refer to people or things in a casual, often rough, or even derogatory manner. This historical root
  is why 『やつ』 can carry a somewhat dismissive or contemptuous nuance, though it has evolved significantly.
  In modern colloquial Japanese, particularly among younger generations or close acquaintances, it can
  also be used affectionately or simply as an informal, gender-neutral placeholder for 'person' or 'thing,'
  akin to English 'guy,' 'dude,' or 'thingy.' However, the underlying implication of a lack of respect
  or formality remains, which is why it should not be used with superiors or in formal settings.
writeup: The word 『やつ』 (yatsu) is a versatile and frequently used informal term in Japanese, primarily
  functioning as a casual substitute for 'person' (人), 'thing' (物), or 'matter/event' (事). Its precise
  nuance is heavily context-dependent and can range from affectionate familiarity to dismissive contempt,
  or simply a very informal, general reference.When referring to people, 『やつ』 often translates to 'guy,'
  'fellow,' 'chap,' or 'dude.' It's typically used among close friends or by an older person referring
  to someone younger or of lower status. For example, a father might affectionately refer to his son as
  『あいつは面白いやつだ』 ('That guy's interesting'). However, it can also carry a negative or contemptuous connotation,
  as in 『あのやつは本当に嫌いだ』 ('I really hate that guy'). This usage is more common for male speakers or in rougher
  speech.For inanimate objects or animals, 『やつ』 acts as an informal 'thing' or 'one.' For instance, when
  pointing to an object, you might say 『このやつ、いいね』 ('This thing is good, isn't it?'). It can be used to
  refer to pets affectionately. For example, 『うちの猫、かわいいやつだよ』 ('My cat, he's a cute little fella').Grammatically,
  『やつ』 behaves like a noun and can be preceded by plain form verbs, adjectives, or other nouns to describe
  the 'person' or 'thing' in question. For example, 『よく食べるやつ』 ('a person who eats a lot') or 『赤い傘のやつ』
  ('the person with the red umbrella'). It can also be used to refer to a situation or a matter, similar
  to 『こと』, as in 『そんなことをするやつじゃない』 ('He's not the type of person to do something like that').It's crucial
  to understand that 『やつ』 is strictly informal. Using it in formal settings or towards people of higher
  status or unfamiliar individuals would be considered highly inappropriate or even rude. Its directness
  can sometimes lend it a rough or masculine feel, though it's used by women in casual, close-knit contexts
  as well.
false_friends:
  - term: もの (mono)
    meaning: neutral "thing" or "person"
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 『やつ』 is highly informal and can carry specific connotations (familiarity, contempt),
      『もの』 is a neutral term for 'thing' or 'person' (especially when referring to the nature of something
      or someone) and lacks the strong informal register of 『やつ』. 『もの』 can be used in more general or
      slightly more formal contexts.
    grammar_point: の (noun omission)
  - term: こと (koto)
    meaning: abstract "thing," "matter," or "event"
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 『やつ』 can sometimes refer to abstract matters or situations, similar to 『こと』. However, 『こと』
      is always used for abstract concepts, actions, or facts, whereas 『やつ』 retains a sense of referring
      to a concrete 'person' or 'object' (even if the referent is implied). 『こと』 is also neutral in register.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:こと (the act of・the fact that)
  - term: 人 (hito)
    meaning: neutral "person," "human being"
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 『人』 is the standard, neutral term for 'person.' 『やつ』 is an informal and often less respectful
      substitute for 『人』, carrying the nuances of familiarity or disdain. While 『人』 is always safe, 『やつ』
      can be rude if used inappropriately.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:人 (person)
  - term: 奴 (yatsu)
    meaning: informal "guy," "thing"
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is the kanji for 『やつ』. While the meaning is identical, writing 『やつ』 in kanji (奴) tends
      to emphasize the historical and potentially derogatory nuance, making it feel rougher or more dismissive
      than the hiragana form. The hiragana 『やつ』 is generally softer and more widely accepted for casual
      use.

  - term: 野郎 (yarou)
    meaning: '"bastard," "guy," "scoundrel" (often derogatory)'
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 『野郎』 is a much stronger and more derogatory term for 'guy' or 'fellow' than 『やつ』. While 『やつ』
      can be dismissive, 『野郎』 almost always conveys strong anger, contempt, or insult. It's generally
      not used affectionately.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:野郎 (derogatory guy)
  - term: め (me)
    meaning: suffix for contempt or affection
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The suffix 『〜め』 can be attached to nouns or pronouns (e.g., 『こいつめ』, 『貴様め』) to add a strong
      nuance of contempt, disdain, or sometimes playful affection (e.g., for a small child or pet). 『やつ』
      is a standalone noun/pronoun, whereas 『〜め』 modifies another term. The negative connotation of 『〜め』
      is often stronger than 『やつ』.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:め (suffix for contempt or affection)
post_false_friends_writeup: When differentiating 『やつ』 from similar terms, remember that its core lies
  in its informality and its chameleon-like ability to take on various nuances—from familiar to contemptuous—depending
  on the speaker's intent and relationship with the listener or subject. Unlike the neutral 『もの』 and abstract
  『こと』, 『やつ』 always carries a more personal or opinionated flavor. The kanji form 『奴』 often accentuates
  the rougher or more derogatory aspects, whereas the hiragana form 『やつ』 is more versatile in casual conversation.
  While 『野郎』 unequivocally expresses strong negativity, 『やつ』 requires careful consideration of context
  to avoid unintended rudeness. Finally, the suffix 『〜め』, though also able to express contempt, functions
  differently by attaching to other words, intensifying their existing meaning rather than standing alone
  as a general referent like 『やつ』.
examples:
  - english: That guy over there, he's really kind.
    japanese:
      - あそこ に いる {やつ}、本当 に 親切 だ よ。
      - あそこ に いる {やつ}、ほんと 親切 だ ぜ。
      - あの {やつ}、すごく 親切 だ よ。
    english_literally: The one over there, really kind, you know.

      - competing_japanese:
          - あそこ に いる 人、本当 に 親切 だ よ。
        english: That person over there, he's really kind.
        hint: 『人』 is a neutral term for 'person' and doesn't convey the same level of casual familiarity
          or specific male-gendered implication as 『やつ』 can in this context. We're looking for a more
          informal and potentially affectionate term.
    scene: Two friends are observing someone from a distance.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The speaker uses 『やつ』 to refer to a male friend or acquaintance in a familiar and slightly
      affectionate way, reinforced by the sentence-final particle 『よ』.
  - english: What is this thing for?
    japanese:
      - この {やつ} は 何 に 使う の？
      - この {やつ}、何 に 使う ん だ？
      - これ、なん の {やつ}？
    english_literally: This thing, what is it used for?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ は 何 に 使う の？
        english: What is this for?
        hint: 『これ』 is a neutral demonstrative pronoun. While correct, we're looking for a more informal
          way to refer to an object whose specific name is unknown or irrelevant, like 'this thingy'.
    scene: Someone picks up an unfamiliar gadget.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
  - english: I don't want to see that arrogant guy's face.
    japanese:
      - あの 生 意気 な {やつ} の 顔 は 見 たく ない。
      - あの 生 意気 な {やつ} の 顔 なんて 見 たく ない。
      - あの {やつ} の 顔、見 たく ねぇ な。
    english_literally: That arrogant one's face, I don't want to see.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 生 意気 な 人 の 顔 は 見 たく ない。
        english: I don't want to see that arrogant person's face.
        hint: While 『人』 is grammatically correct, it doesn't carry the strong sense of disdain and contempt
          that the speaker intends to convey towards the arrogant individual. We're looking for a word
          that emphasizes negative feeling.
    scene: A person is expressing frustration about someone.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: Here, 『やつ』 clearly conveys strong contempt due to the preceding 『生意気 な』 (arrogant) and the
      overall negative sentiment. It's harsh.
  - english: That kind of thing often happens.
    japanese:
      - そう いう {やつ} は よく ある。
      - ああ いう {やつ}、よく ある ん だ よ な。
      - ああ いう {やつ} って、ある ある だ よ ね。
    english_literally: That kind of thing, it often exists.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - そう いう 事 は よく ある。
        english: That kind of thing (matter/event) often happens.
        hint: 『事』 refers to abstract matters or events. While grammatically sound, 『やつ』 in this context
          gives a slightly more casual and often colloquial feel when referring to a general type of situation
          or problem.
    scene: Discussing common occurrences or problems.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
  - english: The red one in the back, could you hand it to me?

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 後ろ に ある 赤い 物、取っ て くれる？
        english: The red thing in the back, could you hand it to me?
        hint: 『物』 is a neutral term for a physical object. 『やつ』 is used here to refer to a specific, unnamed
          item in a more casual and conversational way, as if saying "the red one."
    scene: Asking for an item in a cluttered room.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
  - english: The guy who was talking just now was really funny.
    japanese:
      - さっき 喋っ て い た {やつ} は 面白かっ た よ。
      - さっき 話し て た {やつ}、面白かっ た ね。
      - いま 話し て た {やつ}、面白かっ た なぁ。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - さっき 喋っ て い た 人 は 面白かっ た よ。
        english: The person who was talking just now was really funny.
        hint: While 『人』 is fine, 『やつ』 is often preferred in casual speech to refer to an individual, especially
          if male, in a familiar or generic way without needing to be too formal.
    scene: Two people are chatting after a presentation.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: Even a female speaker can use 『やつ』 in very casual conversation, especially if referring to
      a male or in a slightly rough but not necessarily derogatory way. The 『よ』 softens it.
  - english: My dog is a really spoiled guy.
    japanese:
      - うち の 犬 は、本当 に 甘えん坊 な {やつ} だ。
      - うち の 犬、ホント 甘えん坊 な {やつ} な の。
      - 俺 の 犬、甘えん坊 の {やつ} な ん だ よ。
    english_literally: My dog, really a spoiled one.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - うち の 犬 は、本当 に 甘えん坊 だ。
        english: My dog is really spoiled.
        hint: The original sentence emphasizes the dog as a "spoiled *one*." Omitting 『やつ』 makes it a
          simple statement about the dog's characteristic rather than endearing personification.
    scene: A pet owner talking about their dog.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: Affectionate usage for a pet. 『甘えん坊 な やつ』 refers to the dog's personality, implying it's a
      "spoiled little fellow."
  - english: Don't mess with that suspicious guy.
    japanese:
      - あの 怪しい {やつ} に は 関わる な。
      - あの 怪しい {やつ}、関わら ない 方 が いい ぞ。
      - そんな 怪しい {やつ} と は 付き合う な。
    english_literally: Don't get involved with that suspicious one.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 怪しい 人 に は 関わる な。
        english: Don't get involved with that suspicious person.
        hint: 『人』 is neutral. 『やつ』 here adds a level of dismissiveness and stronger negative judgment
          towards the individual in question, fitting the direct warning.
    scene: Warning a friend about a suspicious person.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The combination of 『怪しい』 (suspicious) and 『やつ』 (implied male referent) creates a strong warning
      with a clear negative, almost contemptuous, nuance towards the person. 『関わる な』 is an informal, strong
      prohibition.
  - english: He's not the type of guy who would lie.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 嘘 を つく {やつ} じゃ ない。
      - あいつ、嘘 つく {やつ} じゃ ない よ。
      - 彼 は 嘘 を つく よう な {やつ} じゃ ない から。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 嘘 を つく 人 じゃ ない。
        english: He's not a person who would lie.
        hint: 『人』 is simply 'person'. 『やつ』 here emphasizes "the *type* of person" in a casual, evaluative
          way, implying a characteristic or behavioral pattern rather than just being a human.
    scene: Defending someone's character.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
  - english: This troublesome thing just won't start.
    japanese:
      - この 困っ た {やつ}、全然 動か ない な。
      - この 困っ た {やつ}、全然 動か ねぇ。
      - この {やつ}、ちっとも 動か ない ん だ よ。
    english_literally: This troublesome one, it doesn't move at all, huh.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ、全然 動か ない な。
        english: This, it won't move at all.
        hint: While 『これ』 is understandable, adding 『困った やつ』 emphasizes the speaker's frustration and annoyance
          with the object itself, as if it's a mischievous entity.
    scene: Frustrated with a malfunctioning machine or device.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: Expresses frustration or annoyance with an inanimate object that is causing trouble. 『困った
      やつ』 is like "this troublesome thing/bugger." The 『な』 adds a sigh of resignation.
