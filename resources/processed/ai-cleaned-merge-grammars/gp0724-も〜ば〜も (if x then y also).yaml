  usage-context: general
etymology: The structure combines the particle 「も」, indicating 'also' or 'too,' with the conditional 「ば」
  form of a verb or adjective, creating a parallel structure that emphasizes the co-occurrence of two
  related elements. The repeated 「も」 emphasizes that both elements are true or applicable. Historically,
  this structure highlights a natural, often inherent, correlation between two facts or qualities, implying
  that if one holds true, the other almost invariably does as well.
writeup: |-
  The 「も〜ば〜も」 construction in Japanese highlights that if one thing is true, another related thing is also true. It emphasizes that traits or characteristics often go hand-in-hand, suggesting a strong correlation between them. The general idea is "If (A) is true, then (B) is also true."

  Here's the breakdown:

  *   「も」 connects to a noun.
  *   The first predicate uses the 「ば」 conditional form. This varies depending on the part of speech:
      *   **Verbs:** Change to their ば-form (e.g., 食べる → 食べれば).
      *   **い-Adjectives:** Change to their ければ-form (e.g., 寒い → 寒ければ).
      *   **な-Adjectives/Nouns:** Use 「なら」 or 「ならば」 after them (e.g., 静か → 静かなら, 学生 → 学生なら).
  *   The second 「も」 follows a noun and is typically followed by a predicate similar to the first one, but not necessarily in the conditional form.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *   Both traits must share a mutual connection; they should both be positive, neutral, or negative. It is unnatural to mix positive and negative traits in this construction.
  *   This construction is generally used in standard or semi-formal contexts. It is not typically seen in very casual or overly formal speech.
  *   It implies that the existence of one characteristic naturally leads to or is intrinsically linked with the existence of the other, presenting them as a cohesive set.

  - term: 〜し
    meaning: And, moreover, in addition to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「〜し」 simply lists reasons or facts without necessarily implying an inherent, conditional
      correlation between them, 「も〜ば〜も」 emphasizes that if one condition (A) holds true, then a related
      condition (B) also tends to hold true, highlighting a deeper, often inherent, pairing or consistency.
      It's about 'both X and Y' as a cohesive, interrelated set.
    grammar_point: し〜し (and; listing reasons)
  - term: も〜も
    meaning: Both ~ and ~; neither ~ nor ~; also; (not) either
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「も〜も」 simply states that two items (X and Y) possess a certain quality or undergo a certain
      action without implying a conditional relationship between them. For example, 'XもYも〜だ' means 'Both
      X and Y are 〜'. In contrast, 「も〜ば〜も」 explicitly uses the conditional 'ば' form, emphasizing that
      if the first condition is met, the second, related condition is also met, thereby highlighting an
      inherent or expected co-occurrence.
    grammar_point: も~も (both neither ~ nor)
  - term: ばかりか〜（さえ）
    meaning: Not only...but also; much more than; in addition to.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ばかりか〜（さえ）」 expresses 'not only X, but also (even) Y,' implying that Y is an additional and
      often more surprising element. It conveys an additive and often escalating relationship. 「も〜ば〜も」
      focuses on the parallel existence or inherent pairing of two elements without necessarily implying
      an escalation or surprising addition; it emphasizes that 'both X and Y' are consistently present
      together.
    grammar_point: Noun・Verb・Adjective+ばかりか~(さえ) (not only ~ but also)
  - term: のみならず
    meaning: Not only...but also, Not just...but also, What is more
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「のみならず」 is a formal 'not only X, but also Y' construction, often used to extend a statement
      to a broader scope or additional case. It's about inclusiveness. 「も〜ば〜も」, however, specifically
      frames the relationship between two elements as a conditional pairing, suggesting that if one quality
      or state is present, the other related quality or state is typically present as well. It underscores
      a consistent, inherent connection rather than simply adding to a list.
    grammar_point: のみならず (not only... but also)
  - term: たり〜たりする
    meaning: To do things like X and Y; sometimes X and sometimes Y
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「〜たり〜たりする」 lists examples of actions or states, often implying a non-exhaustive list
      or alternation, 「も〜ば〜も」 specifically highlights an inherent, conditional correlation where the presence
      of one quality or fact implies the presence of another. It emphasizes a stable pairing rather than
      a varied list of activities.
    grammar_point: たり〜たりする (do things like x and y)
post_false_friends_writeup: When comparing 「も〜ば〜も」 with these similar expressions, the key distinction
  lies in the nuance of connection. While 「〜し」 and 「も〜も」 primarily list or state coexistence, and 「ばかりか〜（さえ）」
  and 「のみならず」 emphasize addition or escalation, 「も〜ば〜も」 specifically highlights an *inherent correlation*
  or *conditional pairing*. It implies that if one characteristic or condition exists, the other *naturally
  and consistently* follows or is present alongside it, framing them as an inseparable pair rather than
  just a simple collection of facts.
examples:
  - english: My father can speak both Italian and Spanish.
    japanese:
      - 父 は {イタリア 語 も でき れ ば、スペイン 語 も} 話せる。
      - 父 は {イタリア 語 も でき れ ば、スペイン 語 も} 話せ ます。
    english_literally: Father, Italian language also can if, Spanish language also can speak.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 父 は イタリア 語 も できる し、スペイン 語 も 話せる。
        english: My father can speak Italian, and he can also speak Spanish.
        hint: The use of 〜し connects multiple reasons or facts, but it doesn't carry the same strong implication
          of 'both...and...' that comes from the specific conditional structure. We're looking for a pattern
          that emphasizes the simultaneous presence of two qualities.
    scene: A person is describing their father's linguistic talents, highlighting his proficiency in multiple
      languages.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The structure 「も〜ば〜も」 is used to emphasize that both abilities, speaking Italian 「イタリア 語 も
      でき れば」 and speaking Spanish 「スペイン 語 も 話せる」, are true for the father. It implies a comprehensive
      skill set.
    etymology: The etymology of 「できる」 (to be able to, to be skilled at) suggests a deep-rooted sense of
      capability or completion, which is well-suited here to describe acquired linguistic skills. The
      combination with the 「も」 particle and conditional 「ば」 form stresses the dual existence of these
      proficiencies, making them equally important and mutually reinforcing aspects of his linguistic
      talents. This inherent capability is what allows for the expression of both skills co-existing within
      the same individual.
  - english: Winter in Japan is both dry and cold, so you must be careful when using fire outside.
    japanese:
      - 日本 の 冬 は {湿度 も 低けれ ば、温度 も 低い} から、外 で 火 を 使う 時 は 気 を つけ なけれ ば なり ませ ん。
      - 日本 の 冬 は {湿度 も 低けれ ば、寒 さ も 厳しい} から、外 で 火 を 使う 時 は 気 を つけ なけれ ば なり ませ ん。

        english: Winter in Japan is dry, and the temperature is also low, so you must be careful when
          using fire outside.
        hint: Using 〜て for connecting adjectives simply lists attributes. It doesn't emphasize the correlation
          of 'both...and...' in the same way the conditional form does. We're looking for a pattern that
          highlights both conditions simultaneously.
    scene: Someone explains the harsh conditions of winter in Japan and the necessary precautions.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: This example highlights two characteristics of winter in Japan using 「湿度 も 低けれ ば」 (humidity
      is low) and 「温度 も 低い」 (temperature is low). The particle 「も」 reinforces that both aspects are true,
      leading to the necessity of caution stated with 「気 を つけ なければ なり ませ ん」.
    etymology: The word 「低い」 (hikui) for 'low' is used for both temperature and humidity. The etymology
      of 「低い」 stems from a concept of physical lowness or depth. When used with 「も〜ば〜も」, it emphasizes
      that these two 'low' conditions exist simultaneously, leading to a critical situation. This structure
      suggests a natural pairing, where dryness and coldness are inherent qualities of Japanese winters
      that necessitate caution.
  - english: I like both the sound and the design of this guitar, so I never want to let it go.
    japanese:
      - この ギター は {音 も 好き なら、柄 も 好き} な の で、一生 手放し たく あり ませ ん。
      - この ギター は {音 も 好き なら、柄 も 好き} な の で、一生 手放し たく ない です。
      - この ギター は {音 も 好き なら、柄 も 好き} だ から、一生 手放し たく ない。

        english: This guitar, I like the sound, and I also like the design, so I never want to let it
          go.
        hint: Using 〜し for connecting reasons or facts is a common way to list, but it lacks the parallel
          emphasis that も〜ば〜も provides, which states that 'if one is true, the other is also true'. We're
          looking for a structure that strongly pairs two attributes.
    scene: A musician expressing deep affection for their guitar, emphasizing two distinct features.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: Here, 「好き なら」 is used with the な-adjective 「好き」 to show that both the sound 「音」 and the design
      「柄」 are reasons for the speaker's strong attachment. The repetition of 「も」 highlights the equal
      importance of both aspects.
    etymology: The concept of 「好き」 (suki) meaning 'liking' or 'fondness' has ancient roots, indicating
      a state of being pleasing or agreeable. The use of 「好き なら」 (if I like) in the conditional 「ば」 form,
      coupled with the double 「も」, builds a strong argument for the speaker's attachment to the guitar.
      It implies that because both these inherent qualities are appealing, the desire to keep it is a
      logical and inevitable outcome. The phrase 「手放し たく あり ませ ん」 (do not want to let go) reinforces this
      strong emotional bond.
  - english: Whenever I hear about pyramid schemes, I always think that both the scammers and the scammed
      are at fault.

        english: While this sentence also uses 「も」 for 'both', it doesn't convey the specific conditional
          nuance of 'if one is like that, the other is also like that' that the も〜ば〜も structure implies.
          We're looking for a phrasing that emphasizes the inherent nature or a given state of both parties.
        hint: While this sentence also uses 「も」 for 'both', it doesn't convey the specific conditional
          nuance of 'if one is like that, the other is also like that' that the も〜ば〜も structure implies.
          We're looking for a phrasing that emphasizes the inherent nature or a given state of both parties.
    scene: Someone reflects critically on pyramid schemes, expressing a balanced perspective on who is
      responsible.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: This complex sentence uses 「騙す 方 も 騙す 方 なら」 (the scammer is a scammer) and 「騙さ れる 方 も 騙さ れる
      方」 (the scammed is scammed) with 「なら」 to express a critical, balanced view. It implies a certain
      inevitability or characteristic nature for both sides in such schemes.
    etymology: The verb 「騙す」 (damasu) meaning 'to deceive' and its passive form 「騙さ れる」 (damasareru) meaning
      'to be deceived' are central here. The repetition of the noun phrase 「騙す 方」 (the deceiving side)
      and 「騙さ れる 方」 (the deceived side) within the 「も〜ば〜も」 structure serves to emphasize an intrinsic
      nature or predilection. It suggests that if one is a deceiver, that's their nature, and if one is
      deceived, that's their nature, implying a cyclical or inherent flaw in both parties involved in
      such schemes.
  - english: That izakaya is always full because both the staff's attitude is good and the food is exquisite.

        english: That izakaya, the staff's attitude is good, and the food is also exquisite, so it's always
          full, isn't it?
        hint: While 〜し effectively lists multiple reasons, it lacks the strong sense of parallelism and
          inherent connection that も〜ば〜も conveys, suggesting that these two qualities go hand-in-hand.
          We're looking for a structure that emphasizes both traits as equally contributing to the outcome.
    scene: Two friends casually discussing why a popular izakaya is always crowded, admiring its consistent
      quality.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 'This example highlights two positive attributes of the izakaya: the staff''s attitude 「スタッフ
      の 態度 も 良けれ ば」 and the exquisite food 「料理 も 絶品」. The casual ending 「ね」 is appropriate for a conversation
      between male friends, seeking agreement and sharing an observation.'
    etymology: The word 「絶品」 (zeppin), meaning 'exquisite' or 'masterpiece,' historically refers to a
      product of exceptional quality. When combined with 「良けれ ば」 (if it's good), the conditional form
      of 「良い」 (yoi/ii), this construction emphasizes that both the staff's attitude and the food are superlatively
      good. The combined effect of these two high-quality elements makes the izakaya consistently popular,
      highlighting their inherent connection to its success. The casual ending 「ね」 (ne) adds a touch of
      shared observation common among male friends.
  - english: I admire him because he's good at both sports and efficient at work.

        english: He's good at sports, and he can also work efficiently, so I respect him.
        hint: Using 〜し for listing reasons implies 'and' or 'in addition to', but it doesn't emphasize
          the strong parallelism and correlation that も〜ば〜も does, which states that 'if one is true, the
          other is also true'. We're looking for a structure that highlights both abilities as equally
          present and contributing.
    scene: A person expressing admiration for a colleague or friend who excels in multiple areas.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The speaker expresses admiration for a person who excels in both sports 「スポーツ も 上手 に でき れば」
      and work 「仕事 も 効率 よく できる」. The use of 「できる」 in the ば-form highlights the combination of abilities,
      making the person truly respectable.
    etymology: The verb 「できる」 (dekiru) often signifies 'to be able to' or 'to be accomplished'. In this
      context, it reflects an inherent capability or knack. The phrase 「効率 よく」 (kouritsu yoku) meaning
      'efficiently' comes from 「効率」 (kouritsu), relating to 'effectiveness' or 'efficiency,' often used
      in business or productive contexts. The 「も〜ば〜も」 structure with these two distinct areas emphasizes
      a balanced excellence, where the individual's abilities in both fields contribute equally to their
      admirable qualities. The ending 「尊敬 する よ」 (I respect you/him/her) highlights the speaker's genuine
      admiration, implying that these dual skills are indeed the foundation for such respect.
  - english: She has neither status nor money.

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 地位 も お 金 も ない。
        english: She has neither status nor money.
        hint: While this sentence expresses the lack of both, the construction is a fixed phrase that
          emphasizes the 'both...and also not...' aspect more strongly than a simple double-も with a single
          negative ending. We're looking for the specific grammatical pattern that explicitly links two
          negations with a conditional feel.
    scene: Someone commenting on a person's unfortunate circumstances, highlighting a complete lack of
      certain advantages.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: This sentence uses the negative form 「なけれ ば」 (if there is not) with 「も」 to express the absence
      of both status 「地位」 and money 「お金」. It implies a situation where neither is present, emphasizing
      a comprehensive lack.
    etymology: The expression 「〜もなければ〜もない」 (mo nakereba mo nai) is a very common fixed phrase employing
      this grammar. 「ない」 (nai) means 'not exist' or 'not have', and its conditional form 「なけれ ば」 (nakereba)
      means 'if there is not'. The repetition of 「も」 (mo) intensifies the negation, emphasizing the complete
      absence of both elements. This structure has roots in classical Japanese, where conditionals were
      often used to express concurrent states or conditions. In this phrase, it conveys a profound lack,
      almost as if 'if this doesn't exist, then that also doesn't exist', painting a picture of comprehensive
      privation.
  - english: It seems the Prime Minister can both reform the economy and resolve human rights issues.

        english: The Prime Minister can also review the economy, and it seems they can resolve human rights
          issues too.
        hint: Using 〜し for listing abilities or possibilities implies 'and' or 'in addition', but it doesn't
          emphasize the strong parallelism and shared capacity that も〜ば〜も conveys, where both abilities
          contribute equally. We're looking for a structure that highlights both capabilities as equally
          present.
    scene: A political analyst discusses the promising capabilities of the Prime Minister, anticipating
      positive outcomes in multiple policy areas.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The speaker uses 「見直し でき れば」 (if able to reform) and 「解決 でき そう」 (seems able to solve) to suggest
      the Prime Minister's dual capacity for handling complex issues like the economy 「経済」 and human rights
      「人権 問題」. This highlights a holistic competence.
    etymology: The verb 「見直す」 (minaosu), meaning 'to review' or 'to reconsider,' combines 「見」 (mi, look)
      and 「直す」 (naosu, fix/correct), implying a re-evaluation for improvement. 「解決」 (kaiketsu), meaning
      'resolution,' combines 「解」 (kai, untie) and 「決」 (ketsu, decide), suggesting untangling a problem.
      The 「も〜ば〜も」 structure here, combined with the potential form 「でき」 and the volitional/speculative
      「そう」, implies a strong potential for the Prime Minister to achieve both. It's almost as if 'if reform
      is possible, then resolution also seems possible', painting a picture of multifaceted competence
      based on inherent capabilities.

        english: He can do photography, and he can also do narration, so he is valued.
        hint: Using 〜し to list skills implies 'and' or 'in addition', but it doesn't emphasize the strong
          parallelism and combined usefulness that も〜ば〜も conveys, where both skills contribute equally
          to his value. We're looking for a structure that highlights both abilities as a pair.
    scene: A manager explains why a particular employee is highly valued within their team.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: This sentence highlights the individual's diverse skill set, using 「撮影 も でき れば」 (if able to
      photograph) and 「ナレーション も できる」 (also able to narrate) to show he can perform both tasks. The grammar
      point emphasizes that this dual capability is why he is highly valued 「重宝 さ れ て い ます」.
    etymology: The words 「撮影」 (satsuei, photography) and 「ナレーション」 (nareeshon, narration) are distinct
      professional skills. The phrase 「重宝 さ れ て い ます」 (chouhou sareteimasu) means 'is highly valued' or
      'is very useful,' combining 「重宝」 (chouhou, valuable item/treasure) with the passive verb suffix
      「さ れる」. The 「も〜ば〜も」 structure with 「できる」 (to be able to) frames these two abilities as co-existing
      and mutually contributing to his value. It suggests that because he possesses both these skills,
      he is uniquely indispensable. This emphasizes the synergistic effect of his diverse talents.

          the conditional nuance of 'if A, then B also' or the strong parallelism of the も〜ば〜も structure,
          which highlights the separate but equally impressive actions. We're looking for a structure
          that emphasizes two distinct but equally skillful actions.
        hint: While using two 「も」 particles with a single predicate expresses 'both', it doesn't convey
          the conditional nuance of 'if A, then B also' or the strong parallelism of the も〜ば〜も structure,
          which highlights the separate but equally impressive actions. We're looking for a structure
          that emphasizes two distinct but equally skillful actions.
    scene: A narrator describing the impressive and multifaceted skills of an acrobat during a performance.
    register: formal
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: 'This sentence describes an acrobat with impressive dual talents: spinning a teacup 「茶碗 も
      回せ れば」 and a cushion 「座布団 も 回せる」. The use of 「も〜ば〜も」 highlights the rare combination of skills that
      consistently thrills the audience 「観客 を 湧か せ ます」.'
    etymology: The verb 「回す」 (mawasu) meaning 'to spin' or 'to turn,' takes on a dynamic and skillful
      connotation in the context of acrobatics. Its potential form 「回せる」 (mawaseru) indicates the ability
      to perform the action. 「茶碗」 (chawan, teacup) and 「座布団」 (zabuton, cushion) are everyday items transformed
      into props by the acrobat's skill. The phrase 「観客 を 湧か せ ます」 (kankyaku o wakasemasu) means 'to excite
      the audience.' The 「も〜ば〜も」 structure here elevates the acrobat's ability by showing that their talent
      is not limited to one impressive feat but encompasses two distinct, challenging ones, implying a
      profound mastery that consistently captivates the audience.
  - english: Since that child is good at both studying and has a good personality, I bet they're popular.

        english: While 〜し effectively lists multiple reasons, it lacks the strong sense of parallelism

    scene: Two mothers gossiping good-naturedly about a child who seems to effortlessly excel in various
      aspects.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The speaker, likely an older female, observes that a child is both academically strong 「勉強
      も でき れば」 and has a good personality 「性格 も 良い」. The casual ending 「だろう ね」 is common among female
      speakers when speculating or seeking soft agreement, implying a shared understanding of the child's
      attractiveness.
    etymology: The verb 「できる」 (dekiru) for 'studying well' here denotes capability and achievement. The
      adjective 「良い」 (yoi/ii) for 'good personality' signifies inherent quality. The expression 「モテる」
      (moteru) means 'to be popular/attractive' and often implies popularity among peers. The 「も〜ば〜も」
      construction effectively conveys that both academic prowess and good character are present, and
      these two attributes combined are the reason for the child's popularity. The use of 「だろう ね」 (darou
      ne) suggests a shared, gentle speculation common in informal female conversation, reinforcing the
      observation that these dual qualities are inherently attractive.
  - english: You're truly a captivating person, as you're both intelligent and good-looking.
    japanese:
      - 君 は {頭 も 良い なら、外見 も 良い} から、本当 に 魅力 的 な 人 だ ね。
      - 君 は {頭 も 良い なら、外見 も 良い} の で、本当 に 魅力 的 な 人 です ね。

    scene: A person on a first date giving a genuine compliment to their partner, admiring their well-rounded
      qualities.
    register: casual
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 'This casual compliment, likely from a younger male speaker, highlights two appealing attributes:
      intelligence 「頭 も 良い」 and good looks 「外見 も 良い」. The use of 「良い なら」 for the い-adjective with 「も」
      emphasizes that both qualities contribute to the person being truly captivating 「本当 に 魅力 的 な 人 だ
      ね」. The ending 「だ ね」 seeks agreement and conveys a friendly, admiring tone.'
    etymology: The idiom 「頭 が 良い」 (atama ga ii) literally means 'head is good,' signifying intelligence.
      「外見 が 良い」 (gaiken ga ii) means 'appearance is good.' The word 「魅力 的」 (miryokuteki) means 'captivating'
      or 'charming,' combining 「魅力」 (miryoku, charm) and 「的」 (teki, -like). The 「も〜ば〜も」 structure serves
      to emphasize that both intelligence and good looks are simultaneously present, and these two qualities
      together make the person genuinely attractive. The final 「だ ね」 (da ne) is a common casual sentence-ending
      particle that seeks soft agreement or confirms a shared sentiment, often used in intimate or friendly
      settings.
post_example_writeup: Keep in mind that the 'both...and...' structure indicates that if one thing is true,
  the other is also likely to be true, or that they exist in conjunction. This emphasizes a strong correlation
  between the two elements. While this construction highlights characteristics that go hand-in-hand, it
  does not imply causation, nor is it universally applicable to all situations.
