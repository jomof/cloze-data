    "etymology": "他動詞 (tadoushi) consists of 他 (ta, \"other\"), 動 (dou, \"move\"), and 詞 (shi, \"word\"), indicating a verb that affects something else. 自動詞 (jidoushi) consists of 自 (ji, \"self\"), 動 (dou, \"move\"), and 詞 (shi, \"word\"), signifying a verb describing self-initiated action.",
    "writeup": "Japanese verbs are fundamentally divided into transitive and intransitive categories. Transitive verbs involve the subject acting *upon* something else, while intransitive verbs describe the subject's *own* movement or action. Transitive verbs typically require an object marked with 「を」, whereas intransitive verbs use 「が」 to indicate the subject acting independently.\n\nThere are many transitive/intransitive verb pairs in Japanese that must be memorized. Think of transitive verbs as \"other-move\" verbs and intransitive verbs as \"self-move\" verbs.\n\nAlthough not traditionally categorized this way, consider 「する」 (to do) and 「なる」 (to become) as a transitive/intransitive pair. 「する」 implies control or acting upon something, while 「なる」 suggests something happening spontaneously or beyond control.",
