    "etymology": "他動詞 (tadoushi) consists of 他 (ta, \"other\"), 動 (dou, \"move\"), and 詞 (shi, \"word\"), indicating a verb that affects something else. 自動詞 (jidoushi) consists of 自 (ji, \"self\"), 動 (dou, \"move\"), and 詞 (shi, \"word\"), signifying a verb describing self-initiated action.",
    "writeup": "Japanese verbs are fundamentally categorized into two types: **他動詞** (tadoushi), or transitive verbs, and **自動詞** (jidoushi), or intransitive verbs.\n\n**他動詞** describe actions performed by a subject *upon* an object. The subject actively causes something to happen to another entity. These verbs typically take a direct object marked with the particle **を**.\n\n**自動詞** describe actions or states where the subject itself is undergoing a change or performing an action without directly affecting an external object. The action or change occurs *within* or *of* the subject. These verbs typically feature the subject marked with the particle **が**.\n\nA simplified way to consider this distinction is to think of transitive verbs as \"other-moving\" verbs (acting upon something else) and intransitive verbs as \"self-moving\" verbs (the subject moves or acts on its own). Many Japanese verbs exist in transitive/intransitive pairs, and recognizing these pairs is crucial for accurate expression.\n\nConsider the concepts of **動作** (dousa, action/motion initiated by an agent) and **作用** (sayou, an effect or occurrence). While not traditional grammar terms for this distinction, **他動詞** often represent **動作** directed outward, and **自動詞** represent **作用** that manifests inherently.\n\nThough not conventionally grouped this way, **する** (suru, to do) and **なる** (naru, to become) can also be seen as a conceptual transitive/intransitive pair. **する** implies conscious control and agency, where the subject *does* something. Conversely, **なる** implies that something *becomes* or *occurs* on its own, often due to external factors or natural progression, lacking the subject's direct, controlling intent.",
