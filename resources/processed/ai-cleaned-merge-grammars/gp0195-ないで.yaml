        "Verb[ない形] + で": "Indicates an action performed without performing another action, or a request to not perform an action."

    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "usage-context": "General"
    },
    "etymology": "ないで is formed from the negative auxiliary verb 「ない」 and the particle 「で」. 「で」 here retains its meaning of 'by means of' or 'with'. Therefore, it literally means 'by not doing'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ないで」 (naide) functions in two primary ways. Firstly, it expresses an action (B) performed **without** first performing another action (A). This often implies that action (A) was expected but omitted, or that the omission of (A) is notable or surprising. For instance, 「朝ご飯を{食べないで}学校へ行った」 (I went to school without eating breakfast) highlights the absence of eating breakfast before going to school.\n\nSecondly, 「ないで」 can be used to form polite negative requests or commands, indicating that one should **not** perform an action. For example, 「まだ{帰らないで}ください」 (Please don't go home yet) is a polite way to ask someone to refrain from leaving.\n\nIt is crucial to distinguish 「ないで」 from 「なくて」. While both involve negation, 「ないで」 emphasizes the **manner** in which an action is performed (i.e., *without* doing something else) or a direct request *not to do* something. In contrast, 「なくて」 typically expresses a **reason** or **cause** for a state or action (e.g., 「時間がなくて行けなかった」 - I couldn't go *because I didn't have time*). 「なくて」 focuses on the preceding clause as the *reason* for the following clause, whereas 「ないで」 connects two actions where the first is merely unperformed in relation to the second.",
