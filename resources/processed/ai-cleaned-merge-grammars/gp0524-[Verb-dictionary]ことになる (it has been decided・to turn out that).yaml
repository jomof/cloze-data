grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]ことになる (it has been decided・to turn out that)'
learn_before:
  - Verb[dictionary] (dictionary form)
learn_after:
  - (という)わけではない (it's not that...)
id: gp0524
meaning: It has been decided or it will turn out that
pronunciation:
  katakana: コトニナル
  romaji: koto ni naru
formation:
  Verb[dictionary form] + ことになる: Indicates that something has been decided or is a natural consequence,
    often by external factors.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The particle に here marks the result of a change, and なる means "to become". こと nominalizes
  the preceding verb phrase. Thus, ことになる literally means "to become the matter/fact that [verb]". This
  structure evolved to express an outcome or a decision that solidifies into a fixed "matter" or "fact,"
  often one that is externally determined or unavoidable, reflecting a shift from a potential state to
  a concrete reality.
writeup: |-
  Verb[dictionary form] + ことになる is a fundamental grammatical pattern used to express that something has been decided, arranged, or will naturally turn out to be the case due to external circumstances, rules, or established facts. It differs significantly from Verb[dictionary form] + ことにする, which conveys a personal decision or intention.

  The core meaning of ことになる is that a situation or action **becomes a matter/fact**, implying a lack of direct personal control over the outcome. It can be used for:

  *   **Decisions/Arrangements:** When a decision has been made by a third party, or an arrangement has been finalized. For example, "It has been decided that I will transfer departments."
  *   **Natural/Unavoidable Outcomes:** When something is a logical or unavoidable consequence of a situation. For example, "If you continue to not study, you will naturally fail the exam."
  *   **Rules/Customs:** To state established rules or customs, often conveying an impersonal truth. For example, "In Japan, you take off your shoes when entering a house."

  It often translates to "it has been decided that...", "it turns out that...", "it comes to pass that...", or "it means that..." depending on context. This structure emphasizes the result or the status of something becoming a settled fact, rather than the process or the agent of the decision.

  - term: '[Verb-dictionary]ことにする'
    meaning: to decide to do
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「〜ことにする」 expresses a personal decision or intention, where the speaker (or subject) actively
      chooses to do something. In contrast, 「〜ことになる」 indicates a decision made by external factors or
      an unavoidable outcome, with less personal agency.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]ことにする (to decide to do)'
  - term: '[Verb-dictionary]つもりだ'
    meaning: to intend to
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「〜つもりだ」 expresses the speaker's personal intention or belief about something, which may or
      may not align with reality. 「〜ことになる」, however, describes a concrete outcome or decision that is
      already established or will definitely occur, often due to external factors.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]つもりだ (to intend to)'
  - term: 〜のだ・〜んだ
    meaning: explanatory (it is that...)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both can explain circumstances, 「〜のだ・〜んだ」 provides an explanation or background for
      a situation, often emphasizing the reason or cause. 「〜ことになる」 specifically states what the outcome
      or established decision is, functioning more as a statement of fact or consequence.
    grammar_point: 〜のだ・〜んだ (explanatory)
post_false_friends_writeup: It is crucial to differentiate between 〜ことになる and 〜ことにする. The former highlights
  an external decision or an unavoidable outcome, while the latter emphasizes a personal choice. Consider
  whether the subject of the sentence has direct control over the action or event described. If the action
  is a result of circumstances or someone's else's decision, 〜ことになる is appropriate. If it is a self-initiated
  decision, 〜ことにする is used.
