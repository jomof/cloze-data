    "etymology": "「そうすると」 is derived from 「そう」 (meaning \"that way\" or \"like that\"), 「する」 (to do), and the conditional particle 「と」. It literally means \"if you do that\" or \"when you do that.\"",
    "writeup": "「そうすると」 is a conjunction used to express a cause-and-effect relationship between two statements. It indicates that once action A is performed, result B will follow. It is often used at the beginning of a sentence to highlight a consequence of the previous statement. The \"result\" conveyed by 「そうすると」 is typically something the speaker has no control over, or a conclusion the speaker wants to confirm. While 「そう」 has a kanji form (然う), it is typically written in hiragana.",
