        "usage-context": "Generally applicable in various contexts, connecting statements or actions with their direct outcomes or logical deductions.",
        "function": "Connects a preceding action or statement to a resulting outcome or a confirmed understanding.",
        "nuance": "Implies that the speaker has no control over the outcome, or is seeking confirmation of a logical deduction. Often highlights a direct, inevitable cause-and-effect."
    },
    "etymology": "「そうすると」 is a combination of 「そう」 (an adverb meaning \"like that\" or \"as such\"), the verb 「する」 (to do), and the conjunction particle 「と」. It literally means something like \"If you do that.\"",
    "writeup": "「そうすると」 is a conjunctive phrase combining the adverb 「そう」 (meaning \"like that\" or \"as such\"), the verb 「する」 (to do), and the conjunction particle 「と」. It primarily expresses that once a certain action or condition (A) is met, a specific result or consequence (B) will follow. It signifies a direct, often inevitable, cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nThis phrase typically begins a new sentence, serving to highlight the outcome that arises from the circumstances mentioned in the preceding statement. It functions similarly to a conjunction, providing a clear link between a premise and its consequence.\n\nIt is important to understand that the result conveyed by 「そうすると」 falls into one of two categories:\n\n1.  **A consequence over which the speaker has no control**: This refers to a natural or automatic outcome. For example, if you push a button, the door opens – the door opening is an automatic consequence.\n2.  **A conclusion or determination the speaker wants to confirm**: This use is common when the speaker is drawing a logical deduction from someone else's statement and wants to verify their understanding. In such cases, the translation is closer to \"So you mean to say...\" or \"If so, then...\"\n\n**Fun Fact**: Although 「そう」 (然う) has a kanji form, this particular word is almost always written in hiragana in modern Japanese. This tendency applies to many other expressions that use 「そう」, not just 「そうすると」.",
