    "etymology": "「そうすると」is a combination of 「そう」 (an adverb meaning \"like that\", or \"as such\"), the verb 「する」 (to do), and the conjunction particle 「と」. It literally means something like \"If you do that.\"",
    "writeup": "「そうすると」, combines 「そう」 (meaning \"like that\") with 「する」 and the conjunction particle 「と」. It indicates that **B** occurs as a result of **A**, or upon **A**, **B** happens. 「そうすると」 typically begins a new sentence, emphasizing a consequence of the preceding statement. It functions as a conjunction.  Be aware that 「そうすると」 implies either a speaker's lack of control over the outcome or their confirmation of a conclusion based on their understanding.",
