The original \"giving\" aspect is twisted to imply giving someone a hard time, or a consequence, rather than a favor.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「～てやる」 is an auxiliary verb construction used when the speaker performs an action, fully aware that it will cause trouble, difficulty, or inconvenience for another person. This often conveys a sense of spite, condescension, or deliberate imposition on the part of the speaker.\n\nThis expression is typically used in casual settings and can be perceived as rude or aggressive, especially if directed towards superiors or strangers. Its use often indicates the speaker's frustration or negative emotions towards the recipient of the action.\n\nWhile not exclusively gender-specific, 「～てやる」 is more commonly used by male speakers. It should be used with caution, as it can sound harsh depending on the context and relationship between speakers.",
