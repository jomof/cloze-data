details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: general
  function: To classify or categorize a specific item as belonging to a larger group.
  nuance: Emphasizes that the item in question is simply one instance among many similar items within
    a category, rather than being unique or the only one
etymology: The grammar point is constructed from 「〜は」 (topic marker), 「〜の一つ」 (one of ~), and 「だ」 (copula).
  「一つ」 is a counter for general objects, and 「〜の一つだ」 indicates that something is one of many within a
  larger group or category. This fundamental structure reflects the directness of classification in Japanese.
writeup: 'The grammatical construction **Noun・Adjective+は〜の一つだ** is used to assert that a particular noun
  is a single item or instance belonging to a larger, broader category. While the grammar point name includes
  ''Adjective'', this refers to an adjective modifying the noun which is the subject. The structure fundamentally
  applies to nouns.In this pattern, the specific item (Noun A) is followed by the topic particle 「は」.
  The larger category (Noun B) is then followed by 「の」 and a suitable counter, most commonly 「一つ」, which
  means ''one'' and is used for general objects. The sentence concludes with the copula 「だ」 (or 「です」 for
  polite speech).For example, if you say 「猫はペットの一つです。」, you are classifying ''cats'' as belonging to the
  category of ''pets''. This highlights that there are many other types of pets besides cats.It is important
  to note that while 「一つ」 is the most common counter used, it is not the only one. Depending on the nature
  of the noun being discussed, other counters may be more appropriate and commonly used. For instance:For
  people, 「一人」 (ひとり) is used: 「彼は優秀な学生の一人です。」 (He is one of the excellent students.)For long, cylindrical
  objects, 「一本」 (いっぽん) is used: 「この鉛筆は私の筆記用具の一本です。」 (This pencil is one of my writing tools.)For books
  or bound volumes, 「一冊」 (いっさつ) is used: 「この本は彼のお気に入りの漫画の一冊だ。」 (This book is one of his favorite manga.)For
  types or kinds, 「一種類」 (ひと しゅるい) is used: 「トマトは果物の一種類です。」 (Tomatoes are one type of fruit.)The choice
  of counter depends directly on the noun (A) being classified, ensuring natural and correct Japanese
  usage.'
false_friends:
  - term: のなかで
    meaning: Among, out of, within
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both expressions involve a group, 「〜は〜の一つだ」 simply states that something is a member
      of a larger category. In contrast, 「〜のうち(で)」 is used when you are selecting, comparing, or singling
      out something *from within* that group, often implying a subset or a particular instance among others.
    grammar_point: のなかで (in・among)
post_false_friends_writeup: The crucial distinction between 「〜は〜の一つだ」 and 「〜のうち(で)」 lies in their primary
  function. 「〜は〜の一つだ」 serves to classify, stating that something belongs to a general category. For example,
  「犬は動物の一つだ」 (A dog is one of the animals) classifies dogs as animals. On the other hand, 「〜のうち(で)」 focuses
  on selection or comparison *within* a defined group. For instance, 「犬のうちで、柴犬が一番好きだ」 (Among dogs, I like
  Shiba Inu the most) picks a favorite from the group of dogs. Therefore, if you are simply categorizing,
  use 「〜は〜の一つだ」; if you are choosing or making a distinction within a group, consider 「〜のうち(で)」.
examples:
  - english: A cat is one of many pets.
    japanese:
      - 猫 は ペット の {一 つ です}
      - 猫 は ペット の {一 つ だ}
    english_literally: Cat is of pets one.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 猫 は ペット の うち で 飼わ れる 動物 です。
        english: A cat is an animal that is kept among pets.
        hint: This sentence implies selection or popularity within a group. We're looking for a simple
          classification stating a cat is a type of pet.
    scene: A man is explaining to a child about different types of animals people keep in their homes.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「です」 makes the sentence polite and suitable for an older man explaining a general
      fact to a child. The phrase 「一つです」 classifies 'cats' as a type of 'pet', emphasizing that there
      are many other pets.
    etymology: The Japanese counter 「一つ」 (hitotsu) originally combined 「日」 (hi, meaning 'day' or 'sun')
      and 「つ」 (tsu, a common Old Japanese particle for counting things). Over time, its meaning evolved
      to simply 'one' for general objects, reflecting a universal way of categorizing single items.
  - english: She is one of my important friends.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 私 の 大切 な 友達 の {一人 です}

      to a specific group.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「大切 な 友達 の 一人です」 uses the counter 「一人」 for a person, emphasizing that she is a valuable member
      of her friend circle. The polite 「です」 maintains a friendly but respectful tone appropriate when
      introducing someone.
    etymology: The counter 「一人」 (hitori) for people is an exception to the regular reading of the numeral
      'one' (ichi) combined with the counter 'nin' (nin). It derives from an older pronunciation, perhaps
      influenced by the native Japanese word for 'one person', highlighting its long-standing usage for
      individuals.
  - english: Happiness is one of life's ultimate goals.
    japanese:
      - 幸福 は 人生 の 究極 の 目標 の {一 つ だ}

    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The casual 「だ」 reflects the relaxed, intimate setting of a philosophical discussion among
      peers. The abstract concept of 「幸福」 (happiness) being categorized as one of 「究極 の 目標」 (ultimate
      goals) makes this a thought-provoking statement.
    etymology: The concept of 「究極 の 目標」 (kyūkyoku no mokuhyō) refers to a 'final' or 'ultimate' goal,
      often stemming from philosophical discourse. The combination of 「究極」 (ultimate) and 「目標」 (goal)
      creates a strong sense of a culminating objective, implying a deeper, more profound pursuit in life.

    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of the specific counter 「一冊」 for a book is appropriate. The casual 「だ」 suggests a
      direct, informative tone, as if providing a factual statement without needing excessive formality.
    etymology: The counter 「冊」 (satsu) specifically for books and volumes originated from the ancient
      Chinese practice of counting bundles of bamboo slips or scrolls. This unit of measurement was adopted
      into Japanese, evolving to denote bound volumes like books and magazines, hence its specific use
      for printed materials.
  - english: Environmental protection is one of our most important issues.
    japanese:
      - 環境 保護 は 私 たち の 最も 重要 な 課題 の {一 つ だ}

      「最も 重要 な 課題」 (most important issues). The formal register emphasizes the seriousness of the topic
      and the speaker's conviction.
    etymology: The term 「環境 保護」 (kankyō hogo, environmental protection) is a modern compound. 「環境」 (environment)
      combines 「環」 (circle, ring) and 「境」 (border, boundary), implying the surroundings. 「保護」 (protection)
      consists of 「保」 (to protect, maintain) and 「護」 (to guard). Together, they form a clear and direct
      concept of safeguarding one's surroundings, reflecting a contemporary social concern.

    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female

    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The polite form 「です」 is appropriate for a tour guide addressing a group. 「最も 有名 な 山 の 一つです」
      clearly states its status as a famous mountain, without implying it's the *only* famous one or the
      *most* famous.
    etymology: 「富士山」 (Fujisan) has a long and debated etymology, with theories ranging from 'immortal'
      (不死) to 'abundant warriors' (富士), reflecting its historical significance. The use of 「山」 (yama/san)
      for mountains is fundamental, categorizing it as a geographical feature. The phrase emphasizes its
      place among other famous mountains in Japan.

      characteristic.
    etymology: The term 「従業 員」 (jūgyōin) refers to a 'staff member' or 'employee'. 「従業」 (jūgyō) means
      'employment' or 'following a profession', combining 「従」 (to follow) and 「業」 (business, profession).
      「員」 (in) means 'member'. This term is widely used in business contexts to refer to personnel.

    nuance: The use of 「一台です」 with 「車」 (car) correctly employs the counter for vehicles. 「私 ども」 (watakushi
      domo) is a humble and formal way to refer to 'our company', appropriate for a salesman. The overall
      phrasing aims to persuade by highlighting its status as a popular choice.
    etymology: The counter 「台」 (dai) for machines and vehicles originates from the practice of counting
      stands or pedestals on which objects were placed. It expanded to count vehicles, machines, and other
      durable goods, reflecting their functional nature.
  - english: Kindness is one of the most important virtues.

    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: Using 「一つだ」 with an abstract noun like 「優しさ」 (kindness) categorizes it as a member of the
      group 「美徳」 (virtues). The casual 「だ」 suits the intimate setting between friends. 「優しさ」 itself is
      a feminine-sounding word, often associated with gentle qualities.
    etymology: 「美徳」 (bitoku) means 'virtue' or 'moral excellence'. 「美」 (bi) means 'beauty' or 'beautiful',
      and 「徳」 (toku) means 'virtue' or 'morality'. This compound emphasizes the inherent goodness and
      aesthetic quality of moral values. The concept of virtues is universal, but its expression varies
      culturally.

    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「一つ です」 is used to classify Tokyo Tower as one of the many iconic landmarks. The polite 「です」
      is appropriate for guiding a visitor. The term 「象徴 的 な ランドマーク」 (shōchōteki na randomaaku) implies
      a significant and recognizable symbol of the city.
    etymology: 「ランドマーク」 (randomaaku) is a loanword from English 'landmark'. Its adoption into Japanese
      reflects the need for specific terms to describe prominent, easily recognizable features in a landscape
      or city, especially in the context of tourism and urban development.
post_example_writeup: As demonstrated in the examples, the counter used with 「一つだ」 will vary depending
  on the type of noun being described. While 「一つ」 serves as a general counter, choosing the appropriate
  specific counter (e.g., 「一人」 for people, 「一冊」 for books) enhances the naturalness and precision of the
  Japanese expression. This highlights the importance of mastering Japanese counters alongside this grammar
  point.
