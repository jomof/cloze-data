        "function": "To establish a fixed reference point in space or time, indicating a boundary, an extent, or a relative position to that point.",
        "nuance": "This usage of 「より」 is often found in formal announcements, instructions, or written language. It precisely defines a boundary or a relative position, indicating 'from' or 'beyond' a specified point. It carries a slightly more formal tone compared to 「から」 when indicating origin or starting point.",
        "colocation": "Often used with words indicating direction (e.g., 先, 後, 内側, 外側) or time (e.g., 前, 後, 早く, 遅く).",
        "grammatical-role": "Connects a noun (referring to a time or place) to the rest of the sentence, serving as a fixed point of reference for a subsequent spatial or temporal description.",
        "temporal-flow": "Establishes a boundary point in time, indicating 'before' or 'after' that specific moment, or marking a start point for an action.",
        "spatial-flow": "Establishes a boundary point in space, indicating 'inside,' 'outside,' 'beyond,' or 'relative direction' from that specific location."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「より」 originates from the verb 「寄る (よる)」, which means \"to approach\" or \"to draw near.\" Over time, 「より」 evolved to signify a point of origin or a standard against which something is measured, leading to its use as both a marker for starting points in space/time and for indicating a basis of comparison (\"than\"). This specific usage focuses on the notion of establishing a point from which an extent or range is defined.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「より」, when used to indicate extent or range, functions to establish a precise reference point in terms of space or time. This usage is distinct from its more common function as a comparative particle meaning \"than.\"\n\nIn this context, 「より」 marks a fixed boundary or origin point, often followed by words that denote direction, position, or a relative time. For example, 「ここより先」 means \"beyond this point,\" clearly defining a spatial boundary. Similarly, 「三時より前」 means \"before three o'clock,\" setting a temporal limit.\n\nThis particular usage of 「より」 is typically found in more formal or written contexts, such as official announcements, instructions, maps, or historical descriptions. While 「から」 can also indicate a starting point, 「より」 in this sense often emphasizes a precise boundary or a point from which a calculation or description extends. It imparts a sense of clarity and formality, making it suitable for situations where exact parameters need to be conveyed. For instance, 「駅より徒歩五分」 is a precise way to state the distance *from* the station, emphasizing the station as the defined starting point.",
