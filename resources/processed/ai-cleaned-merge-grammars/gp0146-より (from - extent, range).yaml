        "function": "To indicate a starting point, a point of origin, or a basis for comparison.",
        "nuance": "Implies a distinction or boundary from which something originates or is evaluated. Can also denote a superior or inferior relationship in comparisons.",
        "colocation": "Often used with comparative structures like 「～のほうが」 (X is more Y than Z) or with adverbs of time/place.",
        "grammatical-role": "Connects a noun (or noun phrase) to the rest of the sentence, indicating a point of reference for comparison or origin.",

    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「より」 originates from the verb 「寄る (よる)」, which means \"to approach\" or \"to draw near.\" Over time, 「より」 evolved to signify a point of origin or a standard against which something is measured, leading to its use as both a marker for starting points in space/time and for indicating a basis of comparison (\"than\").",
    "writeup": "The particle 「より」 is versatile, serving two primary functions: indicating a starting point in space or time, and acting as \"than\" in comparisons. It marks the point *from* which something originates or against which something is being measured.\n\nWhen indicating a starting point, 「より」 establishes a boundary or reference. For instance, 「ここより」 means \"from here\" or \"beyond this point,\" while 「昨日より」 means \"from yesterday\" or \"since yesterday.\" This usage is often found in more formal or written contexts, though it can appear naturally in spoken language.\n\nIn comparisons, 「より」 is a direct equivalent to \"than.\" It precedes the item that is being compared against. For example, 「犬より猫が好きです」 means \"I like cats more than dogs.\" This comparative use is very common in everyday conversation and writing.\n\nIt is crucial to understand the context to differentiate between these two functions, as both are integral to conveying precise meaning in Japanese.",
