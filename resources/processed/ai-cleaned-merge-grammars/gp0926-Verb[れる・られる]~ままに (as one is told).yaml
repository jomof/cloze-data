jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: hard/stiff (i.e. formal, in writing, serious situations)
  function: Expresses compliance with instructions or external influence.
  nuance: Implies acting without resistance or personal initiative, simply following external directives.
    It often carries a connotation of passive obedience or adherence to an external force.
  grammatical-role: Indicates the manner or condition in which an action is carried out, emphasizing that
    the action is a result of external influence or the lack thereof. When used with a passive verb, it
    shows compliance with being told or guided. When used with a negative verb, it indicates an action
    performed in the absence of instruction or influence.
etymology: The grammar point 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」 combines the passive auxiliary verb 「れる・られる」 (indicating
  being told or ordered or influenced) with 「ままに」, which means "in the state of" or "as is". Literally,
  it suggests doing something in the state of having been told or ordered or influenced.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」 signifies performing an action exactly as one is told, ordered, or influenced. It is constructed by attaching the passive auxiliary verbs 「れる」 or 「られる」 to the verb stem, followed by 「ままに」. This construction highlights that the subject is acting in compliance with an external directive or influence, rather than their own initiative.

  This pattern is primarily used with verbs that imply communication or instruction, such as 言う (to say), 命じる (to order), 聞く (to ask), 教える (to teach), 勧める (to recommend), 要求する (to demand), or 案内する (to guide). The sense conveyed is that the action (the part after 「ままに」) is carried out precisely "in the state of having been told/ordered/guided" (the part before 「ままに」).

  For instance, if someone says 「言われるままに」, it means they are doing something **exactly as they were told**. The literal translation often approaches "to do (B) in the state that (A) was done to me," where (A) is the instruction or influence received, and (B) is the subsequent action taken in compliance.

  While less common in modern Japanese, the conjunction particle が (ga) may occasionally appear between the passive form of the verb and 「ままに」 (e.g., 言われるがままに). In this context, が does not carry its typical "but" meaning. Instead, it emphasizes that the instruction (A) was not resisted or argued with when performing action (B). This grammatical structure is notably formal and less frequently encountered in casual conversation, appearing more often in written contexts or serious discussions.

  - term: れる られる (passive・potential・spontaneous・respectful)
    meaning: To be done to, to be affected by (passive voice, often with negative connotation); to be
      able to (potential); to happen spontaneously; or used for respectful expressions.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「れる・られる」 forms the core of this grammar point, it is simply the passive or potential
      conjugation of a verb. 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」 adds the crucial nuance of *doing something in compliance
      with* that passive action or state, emphasizing obedience or adherence to external influence.
    grammar_point: れる られる (passive・potential・spontaneous・respectful)
  - term: ままに
    meaning: As is; while remaining; left in a state; exactly as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ままに」 on its own expresses a state or condition remaining unchanged, or doing something exactly
      as something else happens (e.g., 思うままに 'as one thinks'). However, when preceded by a passive verb
      form as in 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」, it specifically denotes compliance with an external instruction or
      influence, a nuance not present when 「ままに」 is used alone.
    grammar_point: ままに (as is)
  - term: にしたがって・従い (in accordance with and proportional change)
    meaning: As; in accordance with; following; in proportion to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「にしたがって」 implies adherence to a general rule, a natural phenomenon, or a progression (e.g.,
      時間が経つにしたがって 'as time passes'). Unlike 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」, it does not emphasize direct compliance
      with a personal instruction or command, but rather following a broader guideline or development.
    grammar_point: に従って・従い (in accordance with and proportional change)
  - term: に沿って (along)
    meaning: Along, In accordance with, In line with
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に沿って」 means to follow along a path, a plan, or a policy. It suggests adherence to a pre-established
      framework or guideline, implying that the action is *consistent with* something. In contrast, 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」
      denotes *direct compliance* with an an instruction given to the speaker, implying a more active
      obedience rather than mere alignment.
    grammar_point: に沿って (along)
  - term: とおり (exactly as)
    meaning: In that way, exactly, precisely, just as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とおり」 (often written as 通り) emphasizes the exactness or precision of an action in relation
      to something else (e.g., 計画通り 'as planned'). While it shares the 'just like' aspect, it focuses
      on the *accuracy* of the replication. 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」, conversely, foregrounds the *compliance*
      or *obedience* aspect, specifically in response to being told or influenced by someone or something.
    grammar_point: とおり (exactly as)
  - term: ように (purpose or desired state)
    meaning: so that; in order to; in such a way that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ように」 serves multiple functions, including expressing purpose ('so that'), appearance ('like'),
      or a request ('please do'). It often implies a goal or a comparison. 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」, however,
      is distinct in its specific focus on an action performed as a direct consequence of being told or
      influenced, with an emphasis on unresisting compliance rather than purpose or similarity.
    grammar_point: ように (purpose or desired state)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」 always implies doing
  something exactly as someone told you to do, or as an external influence guided you. It's about compliance
  and following orders or influences, not just acting in accordance with a general rule, policy, or for
  a specific purpose. Other similar expressions may focus on accuracy, purpose, or general adherence,
  but 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」 is specifically about unresisting obedience to a received instruction or influence.
  It explicitly uses the passive voice to highlight this reception of influence.

    scene: A male office worker explaining to his female colleague why he prepared documents in a specific
      way.

    scene: A narrator describing a military drill.
    register: formal
    setting: commanding
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: This example highlights the strict hierarchy and absolute obedience expected in military contexts.
      「命じられる」 (to be commanded) is a strong passive verb, and 「ままに」 reinforces the immediate and unquestioning
      compliance of the soldier, reflecting a lack of personal discretion.

      out of trust or casual acceptance rather than strict obedience.

        hint: 「とおりに」 emphasizes precise execution of a judgment or expectation. 「Verb[れる・られる]ままに」 in the
          negative describes acting in the *absence of external direction*. We're looking for an expression
          that conveys acting in a state of not being instructed.
      - competing_japanese:

    scene: An employee explaining to a colleague why they took independent action on a project.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: negative past polite (～ませんでした)
    nuance: The negative past polite form 「言われませんでした」 indicates a specific lack of instruction from a
      superior in the past. This absence of external directive led to the speaker's independent decision-making
      「自分で判断して」, which may imply taking initiative or a necessary step when guidance was not provided.
post_example_writeup: As demonstrated in the examples, while 「Verb[れる・られる]~ままに」 typically implies acting
  in obedience or compliance to external instructions or advice, it can also be used to describe actions
  taken in the absence of instruction (using the negative form) or following less tangible influences,
  such as an internal feeling.
