  - Verb[えば] (conditional)
id: gp9999
meaning: The quality or state of being [い-adjective]
pronunciation:
  katakana: ミ
  romaji: mi
formation:
  い-Adjective (stem form) + み: Forms a noun indicating an abstract quality or inherent state.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The suffix 「み」 (mi) derives from the classical Japanese nominalizing suffix 「み」. It attaches
  to the stem of adjectives to create nouns that denote an abstract quality or state, similar to English
  suffixes like "-ness" or "-ity." For example, 「悲しい」 (kanashii, sad) becomes 「悲しみ」 (kanashimi, sadness).
  This usage emphasizes the inherent attribute or characteristic of something, rather than merely describing
  it.
writeup: |-
  The suffix 「み」 attaches to the stem of い-adjectives to form nouns. These nouns represent an abstract quality, state, or condition associated with the adjective. It's often compared to English suffixes like "-ness" or "-ity."

  A key distinction to make is with the suffix 「さ」 (sa). While both 「み」 and 「さ」 can nominalize adjectives, they carry different nuances:
  *   「さ」 (sa) is very general and can attach to almost any い-adjective (and some な-adjectives when used adjectivally) to indicate the *degree* or *extent* of a quality, or simply to nominalize it for general reference. It often refers to measurable qualities. Examples: 高さ (takasa, height), 大きさ (ookisa, size), 難しさ (muzukashisa, difficulty).
  *   「み」 (mi) is more restrictive and typically attaches to a smaller set of い-adjectives. It tends to denote an inherent, abstract, or qualitative *feeling* or *state* rather than a measurable degree. Examples: 悲しみ (kanashimi, sadness), 痛み (itami, pain), 苦しみ (kurushimi, suffering), 暖かみ (atatakami, warmth, feeling of). It often relates to sensory or emotional perceptions.

  - term: 〜さ
    meaning: The degree or extent of a quality; nominalizer
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「〜み」 and 「〜さ」 nominalize adjectives, 「〜さ」 generally indicates a measurable *degree*
      or *extent* of a quality (e.g., 「高さ」 height, 「大きさ」 size), whereas 「〜み」 often refers to an inherent,
      abstract, or qualitative *feeling* or *state* (e.g., 「悲しみ」 sadness, 「痛み」 pain).
    grammar_point: さ (nominalizer)
post_false_friends_writeup: The choice between 「〜み」 and 「〜さ」 is often subtle and depends on whether you
  want to emphasize the quantifiable aspect of a quality (「〜さ」) or the inherent, often sensory or emotional,
  nature of that quality (「〜み」). For instance, 「甘さ」 refers to the *degree* of sweetness (how sweet something
  is), while 「甘み」 refers to the *taste* or *flavor* of sweetness itself. Similarly, 「重さ」 is the *weight*
  (a measurable quantity), whereas 「重み」 can be the *heaviness* in a more qualitative, often metaphorical,
  sense (e.g., the weight of responsibility).
