pronunciation:
  katakana: ウマクイク
  romaji: umaku iku
formation:
  '[Effort/Situation] が + うまくいく': Indicates that an effort or situation progresses favorably.
  '[Person/Group] が + [Attempt] に + うまくいく': Indicates that a person succeeds in an attempt.
jlpt: N4
etymology: うまくいく is formed from the adjective うまい (umai, meaning skillful, delicious, good at something)
  in its adverbial form うまく (umaku, meaning skillfully, well) and the verb いく (iku, meaning to go). Thus,
  it literally means "to go skillfully" or "to go well," which naturally evolved into its current meaning
  of "to succeed" or "to work out favorably."
writeup: うまくいく is a versatile phrase used to express that something is progressing smoothly, successfully,
  or turning out as intended. It combines the adverbial form of うまい (skillful, good) with the verb いく
  (to go). This literal translation of "to go well" perfectly captures its meaning of achieving a desired
  outcome without obstacles. It can refer to plans, projects, relationships, or any situation that culminates
  positively. While often translated as "to succeed," it carries a broader nuance of things simply "working
  out" or "going as planned," which can be less grand than a full "success." It is frequently used in
  daily conversation across various registers, from casual to formal, and is not notably gender or age-specific
  in its usage. Its application is broad, encompassing everything from personal endeavors to large-scale
  operations.
false_friends:
  - term: 成功する
    meaning: to succeed
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While うまくいく implies things are progressing favorably or turning out as planned, 成功する specifically
      means to achieve a definitive, often significant, success or accomplishment. うまくいく とは異なり、最終的な成果に焦点を当てます。
    grammar_point: する (to do・make)
  - term: 失敗する
    meaning: to fail
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 'うまくいく describes a positive or favorable outcome, whereas 失敗する describes the opposite: an
      undesirable or unsuccessful outcome. They are direct opposites in meaning.'
    grammar_point: する (to do・make)
  - term: できる
    meaning: to be able to do; to be completed
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: できる can mean "to be completed" or "to be possible," which might overlap with "working out."
      However, うまくいく specifically emphasizes the favorable nature of the outcome or process, whereas できる
      is more neutral, simply stating completion or capability.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:するができる (can・be able to)
post_false_friends_writeup: While `うまくいく` shares conceptual ground with phrases like `成功する` (to succeed)
  or `できる` (to be completed or possible), subtle differences exist. `成功する` suggests a more definitive
  and often significant achievement, a clear victory, whereas `うまくいく` can describe a smoother process
  or a satisfactory outcome without necessarily being a major triumph. On the other hand, `できる` simply
  indicates completion or capability, without the inherent positive connotation of things going *well*.
