    "etymology": "This grammar point is composed of several elements: 「の」 (a nominalizer), 「ではない」 (the negative form of 「だ」), 「だろう」 (a conjecture), and 「か」 (a question particle). Literally, it translates to 'Isn't it probably that...?' The indirect phrasing makes it sound more modest and polite.",
    "writeup": "「のではないだろうか」 is used to express an opinion indirectly, often in the form of a rhetorical question. It can be translated as \"I think it's (A), isn't it?\" or \"It might be that (A).\" The literal meaning, considering its components (「の」, 「ではない」, 「だろう」, and 「か」), is 'Is it probably not that it's (A)?' Like similar expressions in English, the drawn-out phrasing and lack of certainty make the statement sound more modest. It can follow verbs and い-adjectives directly, or な-adjectives and nouns preceded by 「な」. 「でしょう」 can replace 「だろう」 for a slightly more polite tone. This phrase can also seek agreement or mildly persuade the listener.",

            "nuance": "The speaker uses 「のではないだろうか」 to express their observation indirectly and politely, showing consideration for their 「先輩」's feelings and status. While no gender-specific language is used, a younger male often uses respectful indirectness in professional settings."
