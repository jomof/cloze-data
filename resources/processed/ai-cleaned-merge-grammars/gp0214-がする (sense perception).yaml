  register: casual
etymology: The grammar point 「がする」 combines the particle 「が」, which marks the subject, with the verb 「する」
  (to do). In this context, 「する」 takes on a unique meaning, indicating the emanation or perception of
  a sensory experience, where the sensation itself is the subject. This highlights the non-volitional
  nature of the perception, emphasizing that the sensory input 'occurs' or 'happens' to the perceiver.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「がする」 is employed to articulate sensory experiences, specifically those perceived through senses other than sight. While the English language might use distinct verbs for each sense, such as "to smell" or "to taste," Japanese frequently utilizes 「がする」 to convey the perception of a sensory phenomenon. This construction emphasizes that the sensory experience itself—the smell, sound, taste, or feeling—is the subject of the sentence, actively "doing" or "occurring."

  For instance, instead of directly stating "I smell roses," one expresses that "the smell of roses is occurring" or "a rose smell is being given off." This grammatical pattern is particularly useful for describing ambient or non-volitional perceptions. It differs from verbs that imply a conscious action of sensing, focusing instead on the emanation or presence of the sensory input.

  It is also commonly seen in the form 「〜気がする」, which describes an intuitive feeling or impression. Here, 「気」 (energy, spirit, feeling) is treated as something that can be perceived or "happen." This extends the usage beyond purely physical senses to include abstract feelings or premonitions.

  - term: に見える
    meaning: To look, to seem, to appear
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「がする」 which describes sensory experiences (excluding sight), 「に 見える」 describes what
      can be *seen* or how something *appears* visually. The nuance is about visual appearance, not other
      senses affecting other senses. 「に 見える」 focuses on visual perception, how things appear to the eye,
      whereas 「がする」 is for non-visual senses like smell, sound, taste, or physical sensation. For example,
      if you want to say "It looks good," you would use 「よく 見える」, not 「よく がする」. This distinction is crucial
      for expressing how something is perceived through different sensory channels in Japanese. The grammar
      point 「がする」 focuses on non-visual sensory perceptions, such as smells, sounds, tastes, and feelings,
      where the sensation itself is the subject. In contrast, 「に 見える」 specifically describes visual perception,
      indicating how something appears or looks to someone. For instance, you would use 「に 見える」 to say
      "It looks strange," referring to its visual appearance, but 「がする」 to say "It feels strange," referring
      to a physical sensation. This distinction helps clarify which sensory input is being conveyed. 「に
      見える」 focuses on how something appears to the eye, describing visual perceptions. For example, 「あの
      人 は 若く 見える」 means "That person looks young." In contrast, 「がする」 is used for perceptions of smell,
      sound, taste, and physical sensations. For instance, 「変 な 匂い が する」 means "There's a strange smell."
      Thus, 「に 見える」 is exclusively for sight, while 「がする」 covers other senses, highlighting their distinct
      applications.
    grammar_point: にみえる (to look like)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「がする」 is used for perceptions involving
  smell, sound, taste, and feeling. In contrast, 「に 見える」 is specifically reserved for visual appearances.
  If you wish to describe how something *looks*, use 「に 見える」. If you wish to describe how something *smells*,
  *sounds*, *tastes*, or *feels*, use 「がする」. For sounds, 「聞こえる」 focuses on the *ability* to hear, whereas
  「音 が する」 emphasizes the sound *occurring*. When describing smells, 「〜臭い」 is an adjective for something
  being smelly, often with a negative nuance, while 「匂い が する」 is a neutral description of a smell's presence.

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 車 が 音 を 立て て いる。
        english: A car is making noise.
        hint: This phrase emphasizes the car's action of *making* noise, rather than the passive perception
          of the sound itself. We're looking for an expression that focuses on the sound being perceived
          by you, not the car actively making noise myself, but the sound existing for you to hear it,
          regardless of the car’s intention. We're looking for an expression that focuses on the sound
          being perceived, not the car's action of making it. We're looking for an expression that focuses
          on the sound being perceived. The sound is passively heard by the listener, it isn't an active
          action on the part of the listener. This phrasing indicates that the noise produced by the car
          is a perceptible phenomenon, rather than an intentional action.

        english: This room smells badly of coffee (or is filled with coffee smell).

          unpleasant, odor, while the original describes a general, neutral presence of a coffee smell.

      input a child might experience. While not explicitly gendered, the simpler expression is common
      for younger speakers. The usage of 「が」 instead of 「は」 here emphasizes the banana as the subject
      of the strange taste. This implies a more direct sensory experience of something strange about the
      taste itself, rather than a general negative judgment about the food. It emphasizes the banana as
      the subject of the strange taste, rather than simply stating that it is bad or unpleasant. This
      implies a more direct sensory experience of something strange about the taste itself, rather than
      a general negative judgment about the food.

        english: I can hear a strange sound from the engine.
        hint: 「聞こえる」 emphasizes the *ability* to hear the sound. We're looking for an expression that
          focuses on the sound *itself* originating or being produced, highlighting its emanation rather
          than the act of perceiving it.

  feelings or intuitions. The specific noun preceding 「がする」 defines the nature of the perception, emphasizing

  'happens' or 'occurs' to the perceiver.
