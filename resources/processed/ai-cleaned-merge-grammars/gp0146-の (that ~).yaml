    "etymology": "The nominalizer 「の」 evolved from the possessive particle 「の」. In its nominalizing function, it essentially transforms a clause into something that can be 'possessed' or treated as a noun.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「の」 functions as a **nominalizer**, which means it turns a clause or sentence into a noun phrase. This allows the phrase to function as a noun within a larger sentence. 「の」 is often used to describe directly perceptible events or situations. It's commonly paired with verbs of perception like 「見る」(miru, to see) and 「聞く」(kiku, to hear). When 「の」 follows a verb or i-adjective, it takes the plain form. However, when it follows a na-adjective or noun, 「な」 or 「だった」 is used depending on the tense.",
