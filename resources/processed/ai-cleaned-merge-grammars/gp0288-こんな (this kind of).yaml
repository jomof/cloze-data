jlpt: N5
etymology: The word こんな (konna) is a contracted form of このような (kono yō na). It combines この (kono), meaning
  'this' and referring to something near the speaker, with ような (yō na), meaning 'like a certain way' or
  'similar to'. This contraction allows for a more fluid and casual expression, much like how English
  phrases can be shortened in informal speech. The core idea is to describe something as being 'of this
  manner or type' in relation to the speaker's immediate perception or context.
writeup: |-
  こんな (konna) is a demonstrative adjective, functioning similarly to an adjectival phrase meaning 'this kind of' or 'like this'. It is used to describe nouns that possess qualities or characteristics similar to something implicitly understood or physically close to the speaker. While この (kono) simply points to a specific item, こんな goes further by describing its nature or quality.

  It is part of the こ・そ・あ・ど (ko-so-a-do) series, which indicates proximity or relation to the speaker and listener.
  *   **こんな**: Refers to something near the speaker, or a quality perceived by the speaker. It often carries a nuance of surprise, emphasis, or a subjective judgment about the nature of the thing.
  *   **そんな**: Refers to something near the listener, or a quality related to the listener's context. It can also be used to express disbelief or rejection ("no way, that kind of thing?").
  *   **あんな**: Refers to something far from both the speaker and listener, or a quality generally known or understood. It often carries a more objective or distant tone.
  *   **どんな**: An interrogative, asking "what kind of?" or "what sort of?".

  こんな is always followed by a noun or a noun phrase. It cannot stand alone as a pronoun, unlike これ (kore) or それ (sore). Its usage is very common in everyday conversation.

  - term: そんな (that kind of)
    meaning: that kind of (near listener)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While こんな refers to things or qualities near or perceived by the speaker, そんな refers to things
      or qualities near the listener or within the listener's context. It can also imply a sense of 'such'
      or 'that kind of' with surprise or disagreement.

  - term: あんな (that kind of)
    meaning: that kind of (far from both)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: あんな refers to things or qualities far from both speaker and listener, or something generally
      known/understood, often with a sense of reminiscence or detachment.
    grammar_point: あんな (that kind of)
  - term: どんな (what kind of)
    meaning: what kind of?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: どんな is an interrogative term used to ask about the kind or nature of something, whereas こんな

    grammar_point: どんな (what kind of)
  - term: この (this)
    meaning: this (specific)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: この is a direct demonstrative adjective that points to a specific item. こんな describes the kind
      or quality of something, often with a subjective nuance, rather than merely pointing.
    grammar_point: この (this)
  - term: こう (like this)
    meaning: this way; like this
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: こう is an adverb meaning 'this way' or 'like this', describing an action or state. こんなは adjective
      that modifies a noun, meaning 'this kind of'. They function differently grammatically.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:こう・そう・ああ・どう (like this・that way・how)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the nuances of the こ・そ・あ・ど series is crucial for natural Japanese.
  こんな, そんな, あんな, and どんな all function as adjectival demonstratives modifying nouns, but they differ in
  terms of the speaker's and listener's proximity and shared context. この is a direct pointer to a specific
  noun, unlike こんな which describes its nature. こう, on the other hand, is an adverb describing the manner
  of an action or state, not the kind of a noun. Pay close attention to whether you are describing the
  'kind of' something (こんな) or the 'way' something is done (こう) to avoid confusion.
