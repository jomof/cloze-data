    "etymology": "「の」is a nominalizer, turning a verb phrase into a noun. 「が」 marks the subject. 「下手」 (へた) is a na-adjective meaning 'unskillful' or 'bad at'.",
    "writeup": "〜{のが下手} (no ga heta) indicates that someone is bad at something, or unskillful. It is similar to saying someone is \"poor at\" a particular activity. It combines a verb in its dictionary form with 「のが」, followed by the na-adjective 「下手」. The 「の」 nominalizes the verb, turning the preceding verb phrase into a noun clause, and the 「が」 marks this noun clause as the subject being described by 「下手」. To express being bad at something in the past, conjugate 「下手」 to its past form 「下手だった」, while the verb remains in its dictionary form. This expression is versatile and can be used with both Ichidan and Godan verbs without any change in the verb's form.",
