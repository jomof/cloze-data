It directly contrasts with **〜のが上手 (no ga jouzu)**, which means to be good at something. This expression consistently uses a verb in its plain, dictionary form, regardless of whether it's an Ichidan or Godan verb.\n\nThe particle **の (no)** functions as a nominalizer, transforming the preceding verb phrase into a noun clause. For example, in 「料理する」 (to cook), 「料理するの」 becomes ",
