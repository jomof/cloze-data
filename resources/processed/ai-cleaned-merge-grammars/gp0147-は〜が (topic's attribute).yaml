id: gp0147
meaning: Indicates a topic with a specific attribute or characteristic; "As for A, B is..."
pronunciation:
  katakana: ハ～ガ
  romaji: wa ~ ga
formation:
  Topic (A) + は + Attribute/Part (B) + が + Description (C): Used to describe a specific characteristic
    or attribute of a broader topic. The description (C) applies to the attribute/part (B), which in turn
    relates to the topic (A)
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: This construction is commonly used to introduce a broad topic (A) with は, and then specify
    a particular attribute or part (B) of that topic using が, followed by a description (C). This attribute
    or part is often something inherent, a state, an ability, or a desire that cannot be directly controlled
    by the topic. It's particularly useful for expressing natural states, physical characteristics, likes/dislikes,
    or aptitudes
  function: To narrow the focus from a general topic to a specific aspect or attribute within that topic,
    emphasizing that aspect
  nuance: The combination of は and が creates a nuanced relationship where は establishes the main topic,
    setting the stage, while が highlights a specific element or aspect of that topic that possesses a
    certain characteristic. It's often used when the characteristic being described is not something the
    topic does, but something it is or has (e.g., 'Elephants have long noses,' not 'Elephants make their
    noses long'). It implies an inherent quality or state. It can also be used to draw a contrast with
    other similar topics
  grammatical-role: The は marks the main topic, which acts as a larger framework. The が then marks the
    subject of the predicate that describes the specific attribute within that framework
  logical-flow: Introduces a general domain (topic A), then singles out a particular item (B) within that
    domain, and finally states something about that particular item (C). It's a 'topic-attribute-description'
    flow
etymology: 'The particles 「は」 (wa) and 「が」 (ga) have distinct historical roles. 「は」 evolved from the emphatic
  particle 「は」 used in Old Japanese, becoming the primary topic marker. It sets the theme or common ground
  for the sentence. 「が」, on the other hand, originated as a possessive particle (similar to ''of'') and
  developed into the subject marker. In the 「は〜が」 construction, the historical functions combine: 「は」
  establishes the overarching topic, and 「が」 then singles out the specific element within that topic that
  the following predicate describes. This creates a logical flow from general (topic) to specific (attribute/subject)'
writeup: |-
  The 「は〜が」 construction is a fundamental structure in Japanese that allows speakers to describe a specific attribute or characteristic of a broader topic. The part before 「は」 (A) introduces the overall topic or theme of the sentence, setting the context. The part before 「が」 (B) then specifies a particular element, attribute, or part *of* that previously introduced topic. Finally, the predicate (C) describes the characteristic of that specified element (B).

  This construction is crucial for expressing intrinsic qualities, abilities, desires, or states that are often beyond the direct control of the topic. For instance, when you say 「象は鼻が長い」 (Elephants have long noses), you are not saying elephants *do* long noses, but rather that long noses are an inherent characteristic *of* elephants. The 「は」 sets 'elephants' as the general topic, and then 「鼻が」 specifically points to 'noses' *as the part that is long*.

  It is often used in situations where:
  *   **Describing physical attributes or inherent characteristics:** 「彼は背が高い」 (He is tall – lit. 'As for him, back is tall').
  *   **Expressing abilities or aptitudes:** 「田中さんは料理が上手だ」 (Tanaka-san is good at cooking – lit. 'As for Tanaka-san, cooking is skillful').
  *   **Stating desires or feelings:** 「私は喉が渇いた」 (I am thirsty – lit. 'As for me, throat is parched').
  *   **Highlighting a specific aspect of a general category:** 「日本は冬が寒い」 (In Japan, winter is cold – lit. 'As for Japan, winter is cold').

  **Important Considerations:**
  *   The particle 「が」 in this construction is not marking the primary subject of the entire sentence in the traditional sense, but rather the subject *of the description (C)* that applies to the attribute (B) of the initial topic (A). The main topic (A) is marked by 「は」.
  *   This structure allows for a clear distinction between the broad topic and the specific attribute being discussed, often implying that while the topic might have many aspects, this particular one is being highlighted
false_friends:
  - term: 〜は
    meaning: As for ~; indicates topic
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「は」 alone introduces a topic, it does not explicitly specify an attribute or part of
      that topic that is being described by a predicate. The 「は〜が」 structure creates a tighter link between
      the topic and a specific characteristic
    grammar_point: は (topic and contrast)
  - term: 〜が
    meaning: indicates subject
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: When 「が」 alone marks a subject, it often introduces new information or is used in contrast.
      The 「は〜が」 structure, however, introduces a topic first with 「は」 and then uses 「が」 to highlight an
      attribute *within* that established topic, often describing an inherent quality or state, rather
      much like the primary agent of an action
    grammar_point: が (subject marker)
  - term: 〜の
    meaning: possessive particle; of
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「〜の」 indicates possession or association (e.g., 「象の鼻」 - 'elephant's nose'). While it can describe
      a relationship, it doesn't carry the same 'as for X, its Y is Z' nuance as 「は〜が」, which explicitly
      sets the initial topic and then details a characteristic of its part or attribute. For example,
      「象の鼻は長い」 would mean 'The elephant's nose is long', focusing on the nose itself as the topic, rather
      than the elephant
    grammar_point: の (possessive)
post_false_friends_writeup: The key distinction among these similar expressions lies in their focus. While
  「は」 establishes a general topic, and 「が」 marks a subject (often new information), the 「は〜が」 construction
  specifically sets a broad topic and then drills down to highlight an an attribute or part of that topic.
  「〜の」 simply shows a possessive relationship. Understanding this difference in emphasis is crucial for
  natural Japanese expression
examples:
  - english: I like English.
    japanese:
      - 私 {は} 英語 {が} 好き です。
      - 私 {は} 英語 {が} 好き だ。
      - 私、英語 {が} 好き。
    english_literally: As for me, English is liked.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 英語 は 好き です。
        english: As for English, I like it.
        hint: This phrase makes 'English' the primary topic. The 「は〜が」 structure here sets 'I' as the
          main topic, then specifies 'English' as the thing I like. We're looking for a statement about
          *my* preference.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 が 英語 が 好き です。
        english: It is I who likes English.
        hint: This phrase strongly emphasizes 'I' as the one who likes English, often for contrast (e.g.,
          'Others may not, but *I* do'). The 「は〜が」 structure here simply states a fact about me and my
          preference without such strong emphasis. We're looking for a general statement about my liking.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の 英語 は 好き です。
        english: As for my English (skill), I like it.
        hint: This phrase refers to your personal skill in English, not the subject itself. The 「は〜が」
          structure here expresses a liking for the subject 'English'. We're looking for a statement about
          your preference for the subject 'English'.
    scene: A new student introduces themselves in a language class, sharing their preferences.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The speaker, a woman, uses 「好きです」 to politely state her preference. The structure 「私は英語が好きです」
      explicitly positions 'English' as the attribute that is 'liked' within the broader topic of 'myself'.
      「私、英語が好き」 is a more casual way to express this.
  - english: Elephants have long trunks.
    japanese:
      - 象 {は} 鼻 {が} 長い。
      - 象 {は} 鼻 {が} 長い です。
    english_literally: As for elephants, their noses are long.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 象 の 鼻 は 長い。
        english: The elephant's nose is long.
        hint: This phrase focuses on the elephant's nose as the main topic, saying that *its* nose is
          long. The 「は〜が」 structure instead sets 'elephants' as the primary topic, then describes 'long
          noses' as a specific attribute of them. We're looking for a general statement about elephants'
          physical characteristics.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 鼻 は 長い。
        english: As for the nose, it is long.
        hint: This phrase makes 'nose' the topic but doesn't connect it to 'elephants'. The 「は〜が」 structure
          first establishes 'elephants' as the topic, then describes their 'noses' as long. We're looking
          for a statement that describes a characteristic *of elephants*.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 象 が 鼻 が 長い。
        english: It is the elephant whose nose is long.
        hint: This phrase emphasizes 'elephant' as the specific creature whose nose is long, often for
          contrast. The 「は〜が」 structure introduces 'elephants' as a general topic, then specifies 'noses'
          as the long part. We're looking for a general factual statement.
    scene: A zookeeper is giving a tour, describing animal characteristics.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: This is a classic example. 「象は」 sets 'elephants' as the topic, while 「鼻が長い」 specifically points
      to their 'long noses' as the attribute being described. It’s a factual statement about an inherent
      characteristic. The casual form 「象は鼻が長い」 is often used in descriptive contexts like documentaries.
  - english: This town is cold in winter.
    japanese:

          - この 町 の 冬 は 寒い です。
        english: The winter of this town is cold.
        hint: This phrase focuses on 'the winter of this town' as the topic. The 「は〜が」 structure first
          establishes 'this town' as the topic, then describes its 'winter' as being cold. We're looking
          for a statement that describes a characteristic of the town itself.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 冬 は 寒い です。
        english: As for winter, it is cold.
        hint: This phrase makes 'winter' the topic, but doesn't specify *where* it's cold. The 「は〜が」 structure
          establishes 'this town' as the context for winter's coldness. We're looking for a statement
          about the town's climate.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 町 が 冬 が 寒い です。
        english: It is this town where winter is cold.
        hint: This phrase emphasizes 'this town' as the one where winter is cold, often in a comparative
          sense. The 「は〜が」 structure states a general characteristic of the town. We're looking for a
          general description of the town's winter.
    scene: Someone new to a region asks about the local climate.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「この町は」 establishes 'this town' as the topic, and then 「冬が寒い」 specifies that 'winter is cold'
      as a characteristic *of this town*. This implies that other seasons might be different, but winter
      is particularly notable for its coldness. The plain form 「この町は冬が寒い」 would be used in a more casual
      setting, such as describing one's own apartment to a friend.
  - english: My son is good at soccer.
    japanese:

        english: My son is good at playing soccer.
        hint: This phrase describes the *act of playing soccer* as skillful. The 「は〜が」 structure directly
          states that 'soccer' is the field in which the 'son' is skilled. We're looking for a direct
          statement about his aptitude in soccer, not the action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - サッカー は 上手 です。
        english: As for soccer, he is good (at it).
        hint: This phrase makes 'soccer' the main topic. The 「は〜が」 structure here sets 'my son' as the
          topic, then describes his skill in 'soccer'. We're looking for a statement about *my son's*
          abilities.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 息子 が サッカー が 上手 です。
        english: It is my son who is good at soccer.
        hint: This phrase emphasizes 'my son' as the one good at soccer, often for contrast. The 「は〜が」
          structure simply states a fact about his ability. We're looking for a general statement about
          his skill.
    scene: A parent proudly talks about their child's athletic abilities.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The speaker, a mother, uses 「上手です」 to express her son's skill. The structure clearly indicates
      that 'soccer' is the specific area where the 'son' excels. 「息子、サッカーが上手」 is a more casual way a parent
      might express this to a friend.
  - english: I'm hungry.
    japanese:
      - 私 {は} お腹 {が} 空き まし た。
      - 私 {は} お腹 {が} 空い た。
      - お腹 {が} 空き まし た。
      - お腹 {が} 空い た。
      - 俺 {は} お腹 {が} 空い た。
      - 俺 {は} お腹 {が} 空い た。
    english_literally: As for me, my stomach became empty.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - お腹 が 空き まし た。
        english: I became hungry.
        hint: While grammatically correct, this phrase simply states 'I'm hungry'. The 「は〜が」 structure
          with 「私は」 puts a subtle emphasis on *who* is hungry, especially if clarifying among a group.
          We're looking for a statement that highlights the individual experiencing hunger.
      - competing_japanese:
          - お腹 は 空き まし た。
        english: As for my stomach, it became empty.
        hint: This phrase emphasizes 'stomach' as the topic, which sounds less natural for expressing
          one's own hunger. The 「は〜が」 structure with 「私は」 more naturally expresses the state of 'I' feeling
          hungry. We're looking for a statement about *your* hunger.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 が お腹 が 空き まし た。
        english: It is I who became hungry.
        hint: This phrase emphasizes 'I' as the specific person who got hungry, possibly in contrast to
          others. The 「は〜が」 structure without this emphasis is a more straightforward statement. We're
          looking for a general statement about your hunger.
    scene: A student loudly announces their hunger during a study break.
    register: casual
    setting: casual slang
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: This is a common way to express a physical state. While 「お腹が空きました」 alone is grammatically
      correct, adding 「私は」 puts emphasis on the speaker as the one experiencing the hunger, useful when
      others are present. The male speaker might use 「俺は」 for a casual, personal tone, or drop the particle
      completely as in 「俺お腹空いた」.

      - competing_japanese:
          - この 部屋 の 窓 は 大きい です。
        english: The windows of this room are large.
        hint: This phrase topicalizes 'the windows of this room'. The 「は〜が」 structure first establishes
          'this room' as the topic, then points out that its 'windows are large' as a feature. We're describing
          a feature *of* the room, not making the windows themselves the primary topic.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 窓 は 大きい です。
        english: As for the windows, they are large.
        hint: This phrase makes 'windows' the topic, but doesn't specify *which* windows. The 「は〜が」 structure
          establishes 'this room' as the context for the large windows. We're looking for a statement
          about a feature *of this room*.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 部屋 が 窓 が 大きい です。
        english: It is this room that has large windows.
        hint: This phrase emphasizes 'this room' as the one with large windows, possibly distinguishing
          it from others. The 「は〜が」 structure states a general characteristic of the room. We're looking
          for a general description of the room's features.
    scene: A real estate agent is showing a client a new apartment, pointing out features.
    register: bijinesu nihongo (business)
    setting: professional
    nuance: The agent uses polite language to describe a characteristic of the room. 「この部屋は」 establishes
      'this room' as the topic, then 「窓が大きいです」 points out the large windows as a key attribute of that
      room. The plain form 「この部屋は窓が大きい」 would be used in a more casual setting, such as describing one's
      own apartment to a friend.
  - english: My mother is good at drawing pictures.
    japanese:

      - competing_japanese:
          - 母 の 絵 は 上手 です。
        english: The pictures my mother draws are skillful.
        hint: This phrase focuses on the *pictures themselves* as being skillful. The 「は〜が」 structure
          describes the *mother's ability* in drawing. We're looking for a statement about her skill.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 母 が 絵 が 上手 です。
        english: It is my mother who is good at drawing pictures.
        hint: This phrase emphasizes 'my mother' as the one who is good at drawing, often for contrast.
          The 「は〜が」 structure states her ability more generally. We're looking for a general statement
          about her skill.
    scene: A child proudly tells their teacher about their mother's talent.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: A child using 「母」 and the polite 「上手です」 to convey respect. This structure highlights that
      'drawing' is the specific skill the 'mother' possesses.
  - english: My eyes hurt.
    japanese:
      - 私 {は} 目 {が} 痛い です。
      - 目 {が} 痛い です。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 目 は 痛い です。
        english: As for eyes, they hurt.
        hint: This phrase focuses on 'eyes' as the topic, which sounds less natural when describing one's
          own physical discomfort. The 「は〜が」 structure with 「私は」 or implied 'I' more naturally expresses
          the state of 'I' feeling pain in the eyes. We're looking for a statement about your physical
          sensation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 が 目 が 痛い です。
        english: It is I whose eyes hurt.
        hint: This phrase emphasizes 'I' as the specific person whose eyes hurt, possibly for contrast.
          The 「は〜が」 structure states the physical symptom more directly. We're looking for a general statement
          about your physical state.
    scene: A person has been working at a computer for a long time and feels discomfort.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: 「目 が 痛い」 is a common, direct way to express pain in the eyes. Adding 「私は」 makes it explicitly
      clear who is experiencing the pain, useful when others are present. The lack of 「です」 makes it casual.
  - english: Japan has four distinct seasons.
    japanese:

      - 日本 {は} 四季 {が} ある。
    english_literally: As for Japan, four seasons exist.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 日本 の 四季 は あり ます。
        english: Japan's four seasons exist.
        hint: This phrase makes 'Japan's four seasons' the topic, implying they are a known entity. The
          「は〜が」 structure introduces 'Japan' as the overall topic, and then specifies 'four seasons' as
          an inherent characteristic it possesses. We're looking for a general statement about Japan's
          climate.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 四季 は あり ます。
        english: As for four seasons, they exist.
        hint: This phrase makes 'four seasons' the topic but doesn't specify *where* they exist. The 「は〜が」
          structure establishes 'Japan' as the context for having four seasons. We're looking for a statement
          about Japan's climate.
    scene: A tour guide explains the climate to a group of foreign visitors.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: This example demonstrates using 「は〜が」 to describe an inherent characteristic of a country
      or region. 「日本は」 sets Japan as the topic, and 「四季があります」 specifies that having four seasons is a
      characteristic of Japan. It is a factual, descriptive statement.
  - english: Tanaka-san has a kind personality.
    japanese:
      - 田中 さん {は} 性格 {が} 優しい です。
      - 田中 さん {は} 性格 {が} 優しい。
      - 田中 さん、性格 {が} 優しい。
    english_literally: As for Tanaka-san, personality is kind.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 田中 さん は 優しい です。
        english: Tanaka-san is kind.
        hint: While this is correct, it's a more direct statement about Tanaka-san's kindness. The 「は〜が」
          structure specifically attributes 'kindness' to their 'personality'. We're looking for a statement
          that specifies the *aspect* of kindness.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 田中 さん が 性格 が 優しい です。
        english: It is Tanaka-san whose personality is kind.
        hint: This phrase emphasizes 'Tanaka-san' as the specific person with a kind personality, often
          for contrast. The 「は〜が」 structure states a general characteristic of Tanaka-san. We're looking
          for a general description of their personality.
    scene: Two colleagues are discussing a new team member.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: This describes an inherent personality trait. 「田中さんは」 sets Tanaka-san as the topic, and 「性格が優しい」
      specifies that 'personality is kind' as their attribute. This is a common way to describe someone's
      character.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「は〜が」 is used to describe an inherent characteristic
  or attribute of a given topic. It allows for a precise way to state what something *is* or *has* rather
  than what it *does*. This nuanced distinction is key to natural Japanese expression, especially when
  discussing physical traits, abilities, or inherent qualities of people, places, or things.
