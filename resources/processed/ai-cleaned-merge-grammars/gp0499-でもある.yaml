    "etymology": "The grammar point 「でもある」 is composed of 「で」 (the te-form of the copula 「だ」), 「も」 (meaning 'also' or 'too'), and 「ある」 (the dictionary form of the verb 'to be', existing). Thus, it literally translates to 'is also'.",
    "writeup": "「でもある」 indicates that something *also is* something else. It is typically used to add an additional, sometimes unexpected, piece of information about a subject. It often implies \"while (A), it is also (B)\" or \"in spite of (A), it is also (B)\".",
