    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「でもある」 is composed of 「で」 (the te-form of the copula 「だ」), 「も」 (meaning 'also' or 'too'), and 「ある」 (the dictionary form of the verb 'to be', existing). Thus, it literally translates to 'is also'. It evolved from the formal copula 「である」, adding the particle 「も」 to convey the sense of 'also' or 'even'.",
    "writeup": "「でもある」 indicates that something **also is** something else. It is an extension of the formal copula 「である」, adding the nuance of 'also' with 「も」. It is typically used to add an additional, sometimes unexpected, piece of information about a subject. It often implies \"while (A), it is also (B)\" or \"in spite of (A), it is also (B)\". This grammar point can be used after nouns or the stem of な-adjectives.\n\nWhile 「である」 is primarily a formal or literary copula, the addition of 「も」 in 「でもある」 allows for a broader range of contexts, even in more casual or reflective speech, when emphasizing an additional, possibly surprising, characteristic. It highlights that the subject possesses multiple attributes.",
