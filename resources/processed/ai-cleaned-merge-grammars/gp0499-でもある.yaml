    "etymology": "The grammar point 「でもある」 is composed of 「で」 (the te-form of the copula 「だ」), 「も」 (meaning 'also' or 'too'), and 「ある」 (the dictionary form of the verb 'to be', existing). Thus, it literally translates to 'is also'.",
    "writeup": "「でもある」 indicates that something *also is* something else. It is an extension of the formal copula 「である」, adding the nuance of 'also' with 「も」. It is typically used to add an additional, sometimes unexpected, piece of information about a subject. It often implies \"while (A), it is also (B)\" or \"in spite of (A), it is also (B)\". This grammar point can be used after nouns or the stem of な-adjectives.",
