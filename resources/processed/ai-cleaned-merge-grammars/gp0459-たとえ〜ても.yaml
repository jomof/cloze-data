    "writeup": "「たとえ〜ても」 is used to express that even if something is the case, it doesn't necessarily affect the outcome. 「たとえ」 introduces a hypothetical situation, and 「〜ても」 indicates that regardless of that situation, the result remains the same or is still possible. It is a contrastive conjunction, meaning that while situation A might lead you to expect Result X, that is not the case. Sometimes 「たとい」 is used, but 「たとえ」 is more common.",
