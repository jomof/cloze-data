    "etymology": "「たとえ」 comes from the verb 「例える (tatoeru)」, meaning \"to compare\" or \"to use as an example.\" It sets up a hypothetical situation. 「〜ても」 expresses \"even if\" or \"even though,\" indicating a contrast or concession.",
    "writeup": "「たとえ〜ても」 is used to express that even if something is the case, it doesn't necessarily affect the outcome. 「たとえ」 introduces a hypothetical situation, and 「〜ても」 indicates that regardless of that situation, the result remains the same or is still possible.  It is a contrastive conjunction, meaning that while situation A might lead you to expect Result X, that is not the case. Sometimes 「たとい」 is used, but 「たとえ」 is more common.",
