meaning: As; in accordance with; following; in proportion to
pronunciation:
  katakana: ニシタガッテ・シタガイ
  romaji: ni shitagatte / shitagai
formation:
  Verb in dictionary form + に従って/従い: Indicates that something spontaneously and gradually occurs in accordance
    with some change.
  Noun + に従って/従い: Indicates acting in accordance with instructions or a specific standard.
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  function: To indicate a parallel relationship where one event or situation changes in proportion to
    another, or to express adherence to rules or instructions.
  nuance: Implies a natural progression or consequence due to a preceding factor. The 「に従い」 form is slightly
    more formal and literary than 「に従って」, often found in written contexts or formal speeches. It can denote
    both a proportional, continuous change and a strict adherence to something.
etymology: 'The grammar point derives from the verb 「従う」(shitagau), which means "to obey" or "to follow".
  The に (ni) particle indicates direction or purpose, thus 「に従って」 literally means "following in accordance
  with". This etymological root explains its dual usage: both following a natural progression and following
  a rule or instruction.'
writeup: "「に従って」 and 「従い」 are versatile grammatical patterns used to express two primary relationships:\
  \ proportional change and adherence. Both forms are generally formal, with 「に従い」 being particularly\
  \ common in written language or very formal spoken contexts due to its conjunctive `連用形` (ren'yōkei)\
  \ form. \n\n**Proportional Change (Verb + に従って/従い)**\nThis usage indicates that as one thing changes\
  \ or progresses, another thing also changes or progresses in tandem. It suggests a continuous and often\
  \ inevitable correlation between two phenomena. For example, as time passes, something else gradually\
  \ happens. This nuance emphasizes a natural or logical progression, rather than a single cause-and-effect\
  \ event.\n\n**Adherence/Compliance (Noun + に従って/従い)**\nIn this usage, the pattern signifies that an\
  \ action is performed \"in accordance with,\" \"following,\" or \"based on\" a specific rule, instruction,\
  \ standard, or agreement. It conveys a sense of obedience, compliance, or strict observance. This is\
  \ commonly seen in business, legal, or official contexts where following established procedures is crucial.\n\
  \n**Distinguishing Forms**\n「に従って」 and 「に従い」 are largely interchangeable in meaning for both usages,\
  \ but 「に従い」 is perceived as more formal and literary. 「に従って」 functions as a conjunctive particle, connecting\
  \ clauses, while 「に従い」 is the `連用形` (conjunctive form) of the verb 「従う」, which can act as a conjunction\
  \ or connect to another verb."

  - term: につれて
    meaning: As, in proportion to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「に従って・従い」, which can mean "in accordance with" (following rules/instructions), 「につれて」
      primarily emphasizes the progressive change or correlation between two actions or states. It implies
      a more natural, less rule-bound progression.
    grammar_point: につれて (as・in proportion to)
  - term: 〜通りに
    meaning: As...; in the way...; according to...
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「〜通りに」 emphasizes precise conformity to a pre-established pattern, plan, or instruction, implying
      that something was done exactly as specified. 「に従って・従い」, while also meaning 'according to', focuses
      more on following a directive or rule as a principle or guideline, rather than exact replication
      of a pattern.
    grammar_point: とおり (exactly as)
  - term: 〜に基づいて
    meaning: Based on; on the basis of
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「〜に基づいて」 indicates that something serves as a foundation or source for an action or decision.
      「に従って・従い」 implies direct adherence or compliance with a rule, instruction, or a progression, where
      the focus is on the act of following rather than merely using something as a basis.
    grammar_point: にもとづいて (based on)
  - term: に応じて
    meaning: Depending on, based on, according to, in response to, suitable for or to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「に従って・従い」 can mean 'in accordance with' a fixed rule or proportional change, 「に応じて」
      emphasizes adjusting or tailoring actions *in response to* varying circumstances or needs. It's
      about flexibility and adaptation rather than strict adherence or a natural, fixed progression.
    grammar_point: に応じて (depending on)
post_false_friends_writeup: To distinguish 「に従って・従い」 from similar expressions, consider the specific nuance
  each conveys. 「につれて」 also describes proportional change, where one thing changes as another does, but
  it typically applies to **natural phenomena or general trends**, without the connotation of adhering
  to rules or instructions. For instance, 'as time passes...' or 'as the child grows...'. In contrast,
  「に従って・従い」 can also convey this proportional change but notably extends to meaning 'in accordance with'
  rules, guidelines, or instructions, implying **deliberate compliance**. Meanwhile, 「〜通りに」 signifies
  **exact replication** or acting precisely as something dictates, such as 'exactly as the recipe says'.
  This is a stricter form of adherence than 「に従って・従い」, which focuses more on following a principle or
  general directive. 「〜に基づいて」 suggests using something as a **foundation or basis** for an action or decision,
  rather than directly following it step-by-step. Lastly, 「に応じて」 implies **adapting or adjusting** one's
  actions *in response to* changing circumstances or requirements, highlighting flexibility rather than
  strict adherence to a pre-defined path or fixed proportional change.

        hint: 「につれて」 (ni tsurete) is also used for proportional change. However, 「に従って」 (ni shitagatte)
          here emphasizes the gradual, almost natural progression of clothing changing in response to
          the rising temperature. We're looking for a formal, informative context like a weather report.

  the latter often preferred in written or more rigid formal speech due to its literary nuance. The careful
  choice between this grammar point and similar expressions like 「につれて」, 「〜通りに」, or 「〜に基づいて」 often depends
  on the exact degree of proportionality, adherence, or basis one wishes to convey.
