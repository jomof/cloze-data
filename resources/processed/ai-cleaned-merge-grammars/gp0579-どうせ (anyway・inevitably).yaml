jlpt: N2
details:
  register: casual
  usage-context: general
  function: expresses inevitability or resignation
  nuance: Often carries a nuance of frustration, pessimism, or resignation, implying that efforts to change
    the outcome would be futile. It can also suggest 'might as well' if paired with conditional structures.
  grammatical-role: adverb
  logical-flow: implies a predetermined or unavoidable outcome, often leading to a conclusion or a 'might
    as well' suggestion
  temporal-flow: can refer to past, present, or future outcomes that are perceived as inevitable
etymology: The grammar structure 「どうせ」 comes from a combination of 「どう」 (how) and the imperative form
  of 「する」, which is 「せよ」. In this way, it emphasizes that no matter "how" something is done, the result
  cannot be changed, conveying a sense of futility or inevitability.
writeup: |-
  「どうせ」 is an adverb used in Japanese to express that a particular state or condition (A) will result in (B). Usually, there is no way to stop (B) from happening, and it is considered a natural consequence of (A). In English, this translates closely with phrases like "at any rate" or "in any case."

  Being an adverb, 「どうせ」 most often appears at the beginning of sentences, before going on to describe the inevitable situation. 「どうせ」 often carries a nuance of frustration or resignation that (A) cannot be changed. In these cases, it is often paired with other grammar structures such as 「なら」 or 「だから」. This shows that if (A) cannot be changed, then (B) is a good idea. This usage translates similarly to "if (A), you might as well (B)."

  While often conveying a pessimistic outlook, 「どうせ」 can also be used in a more neutral or even practical sense, indicating that since something is inevitable, one might as well proceed in a certain way. The nuance largely depends on the context and the speaker's tone.
false_friends:
  - term: 何しろ
    meaning: no wonder, after all, in fact, because, at any rate
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「どうせ」, 「何しろ」 often provides a reason or explanation for a situation, rather than an
      acceptance of an inevitable, often negative, outcome. It suggests 'for this reason, naturally...'
    grammar_point: 何しろ (anyway・after all)
  - term: 何といっても
    meaning: by any account, all the same, no doubt
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「何といっても」 emphasizes a particular quality or fact as being the most important or undeniable,
      while 「どうせ」 focuses on the futility of changing a situation or the inevitability of an outcome.
      It's more about 'after all, the most important thing is...'
    grammar_point: 何といっても (unquestionably)
  - term: という のは 事実だ
    meaning: It is a fact that ~, There is no doubt that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express certainty, 「〜というのは事実だ」 states a verifiable fact objectively. 「どうせ」, however,
      carries a subjective nuance of resignation or a strong, often pessimistic, conviction about an unchangeable
      situation, rather than a mere factual statement.
    grammar_point: という のは 事実だ (it is a fact that)
  - term: どうにも〜ない
    meaning: Cannot ~ by any means; no matter how hard ~ try, ~ cannot ~; there is no way to ~; cannot
      do ~ at all
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express a sense of impossibility or futility, 「どうにも〜ない」 emphasizes an inability
      to change a situation despite effort or desire, often focusing on the lack of means or recourse.
      「どうせ」, however, conveys a resigned acceptance that an outcome will inevitably occur regardless of
      what is done, often implying that effort is pointless from the outset.
    grammar_point: どうにも〜ない (no way to ~)
  - term: に決まっている
    meaning: It is surely the case; It is bound to be; It is certainly true.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に決まっている」 expresses a strong, objective certainty that something is true or will happen. In
      contrast, 「どうせ」 conveys a subjective, often pessimistic, inevitability, suggesting resignation rather
      than objective fact. With 「どうせ」, the speaker might still act, but without hope.
    grammar_point: に決まっている (surely is)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「どうせ」, 「何しろ」, 「何といっても」, 「～というのは事実だ」, and 「に決まっている」 can all convey certainty
  or a conclusion, their nuances differ significantly. 「どうせ」 expresses a sense of inevitability and often
  resignation, particularly when the outcome is undesirable, implying futility of effort. 「何しろ」 provides
  a reason or context that explains a situation, often with a sense of 'no wonder'. 「何といっても」 highlights
  an undeniable or most significant aspect. 「～というのは事実だ」 is a straightforward statement of objective fact.
  Finally, 「に決まっている」 asserts a strong, objective certainty about an outcome, without necessarily implying
  the futility or resignation found in 「どうせ」.
examples:
  - english: He's going to be late again anyway.
    japanese:
      - '{どうせ} また 遅刻 する ん だろう。'
      - '{どうせ} また 遅刻 だ よ。'
      - '{どうせ} また 遅刻 する でしょう。'
      - '{どうせ} また 遅刻 する に 決まっ て いる。'

        english: He will probably be late again.
        hint: This is a simple prediction. We're looking for an expression that conveys a sense of resignation
          or inevitability that he will be late again.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 何しろ また 遅刻 する ん だろう。
        english: After all, he'll be late again.
        hint: 「何しろ」 provides a reason or explanation, implying 'no wonder' or 'for this reason'. We're
          looking for a word that expresses an inevitable, often resigned, outcome.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が また 遅刻 する と いう の は 事実 だ。
        english: It is a fact that he will be late again.
        hint: 「～というのは事実だ」 states an objective fact. We're looking for an expression that conveys a subjective
          sense of inevitability or resignation.

          - 彼 は また 遅刻 する に 決まっ て いる。
        english: He is surely going to be late again.
        hint: 「に決まっている」 states strong objective certainty. We're looking for an expression that conveys
          a subjective feeling of resignation about an inevitable, often negative, outcome.
    scene: A colleague commenting on another colleague's recurring lack of punctuality.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: The use of 「どうせ」 here expresses the speaker's resignation and certainty that the person will
      be late again, indicating a pattern of behavior that they view as unavoidable. The phrase 「～だろう」
      reinforces this assumption. This is an example of 'どうせ + [statement about an inevitable outcome]'
      formation, implying a resigned acceptance of a negative pattern that is likely to continue, making
      efforts to change it feel pointless from the speaker's perspective. It often carries a shade of
      mild frustration or cynicism about the situation being beyond one's influence, leading to a predetermined
      unfavorable outcome. This nuance sets it apart from simple predictions or factual statements, as
      it conveys a more personal and often negative expectation of inevitability. The choice of 「だろう」
      rather than a stronger assertion hints at a prediction colored by past experiences and a lack of
      belief in change. The addition of 「だよ」 in another Japanese variant further emphasizes this personal,
      slightly weary conviction. The context of a colleague commenting on another's punctuality typically
      suggests a recurring, annoying behavior, which aligns well with the resigned nuance of 「どうせ」. The
      speaker is not just stating a fact but expressing their expectation that the pattern will persist.
      The multiple Japanese translations show varying degrees of politeness and assertiveness for this
      type of resigned prediction.
    etymology: The phrase 「遅刻 する」 (chikoku suru) meaning "to be late" is a common compound verb in Japanese,
      combining the noun for "lateness" with the verb "to do."
  - english: Anyway, no one is going to pay attention to someone like me.

          emphasizes a resigned feeling of inevitable self-insignificance.

        english: After all, no one pays attention to someone like me.
        hint: 「何しろ」 gives a reason or context for the situation. We're looking for an expression that
          signifies a resigned belief in an inevitable, often negative, outcome.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 なんて 誰 に も 相手 に さ れ ない と いう の は 事実 だ よ。
        english: It is a fact that no one pays attention to someone like me.
        hint: 「～というのは事実だ」 states an objective fact. We're looking for a subjective feeling of inevitability
          and self-deprecation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 なんて 誰 に も 相手 に さ れ ない に 決まっ て いる。
        english: No one is surely going to pay attention to someone like me.
        hint: 「に決まっている」 expresses objective certainty. We're looking for an expression that conveys a
          subjective feeling of resignation about being ignored.
    scene: A person feeling ignored and expressing self-deprecating thoughts at a social gathering.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: 「どうせ」 emphasizes a deep-seated feeling of inevitability regarding one's own perceived insignificance.
      The addition of 「なんて」 after 「私」 (watashi) further amplifies this self-deprecating sentiment, suggesting
      that the speaker views themselves as unworthy of attention. This is an example of 'どうせ + [statement
      about an inevitable outcome]' formation, where the inevitable outcome is a personal feeling of being
      ignored. The phrase 「相手 に されない」 (aite ni sarenai) is a passive form, literally "not being made an
      opponent/partner of," which effectively means "to be ignored" or "not paid attention to." The combination
      with 「なんて」 adds a sense of dismissal or self-deprecation, intensifying the feeling of resignation
      that one is simply not worth anyone's attention, regardless of what they do. This usage is highly
      subjective and emotionally charged, indicating a deeply ingrained pessimism or low self-esteem.
    etymology: The expression 「相手 に される」 (aite ni sareru) means "to be treated as a counterpart/opponent/partner"
      or "to be attended to." Its negative form 「相手 に されない」 (aite ni sarenai) means "to be ignored" or
      "not paid attention to."
  - english: If we're going to buy it anyway, let's go with a well-regarded brand.

      - '{どうせ} 買う ん だ から、評判 の いい ブランド に しよう。'
      - '{どうせ} 買う こと に なる の なら、評判 の いい ブランド に しよう よ。'
    english_literally: Anyway, if we buy, let's choose a well-regarded brand, okay?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 買う なら、評判 の いい ブランド に しよう よ。
        english: If we're buying, let's go with a well-regarded brand.
        hint: This is a simple conditional. We're looking for an expression that implies the action of
          buying is already inevitable, leading to a 'might as well' decision.
    scene: Friends discussing a purchase, with one suggesting investing in a better quality item since
      they're already spending money.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: This usage of 「どうせ」, often combined with 「～なら」, suggests a 'might as well' attitude. Since
      the action (buying) is inevitable, the speaker proposes making the best of the situation by choosing
      a high-quality option, here 「評判 の いい ブランド」 (hyōban no ii burando - a well-regarded brand). This
      example perfectly illustrates the 'どうせ + [conditional (e.g., なら, ならば)] + [statement of resignation
      or 'might as well' action]' formation. The initial inevitability, 「買う」 (kau - to buy), is accepted,
      and then the focus shifts to making the most of that accepted situation. The speaker isn't resigned
      in a pessimistic way, but rather in a pragmatic, forward-looking way. The phrase 「評判 の いい」 (hyōban
      no ii) means "well-regarded" or "reputable," emphasizing the choice of quality once the decision
      to buy is made. This practical application of 「どうせ」 often occurs in informal settings among friends
      or family, where shared circumstances lead to a common-sense resolution. The use of 「～しよう よ」 (shiyou
      yo) makes it a friendly suggestion, despite the underlying inevitability.
    etymology: The phrase 「評判 の いい」 (hyōban no ii) is a common way to describe something that has a good
      reputation, combining the noun for "reputation" (評判) with the particle "no" (の) and the adjective
      "good" (いい).
  - english: It won't be resolved in the end anyway, so let's just give up.
    japanese:
      - '{どうせ} 最後 まで 解決 し ない ん だ から、もう 諦めよう。'
      - '{どうせ} 解決 し ない、諦めよう。'
      - '{どうせ} 最後 まで 解決 する こと は ない の だ から、もう 諦め ましょう。'
      - '{どうせ} 最後 まで 解決 し ない。もう 諦める しか ない。'
    english_literally: Anyway, until the end, it won't be resolved, that's why, already, let's give up.

        hint: This states a reason and a conclusion. We're looking for an expression that conveys a stronger
          sense of resignation that the problem is inherently and unavoidably destined to fail.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 何しろ 最後 まで 解決 し ない ん だ から、もう 諦めよう。
        english: After all, it's not resolved in the end, so let's just give up.
        hint: 「何しろ」 gives a reason for the conclusion. We're looking for an expression that conveys a
          sense of resignation that the outcome is already predetermined, regardless of effort.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 最後 まで 解決 し ない と いう の は 事実 だ から、もう 諦めよう。
        english: It is a fact that it won't be resolved in the end, so let's just give up.
        hint: 「～というのは事実だ」 states an objective fact. We're looking for a subjective, often pessimistic,
          conviction about an unchangeable situation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 最後 まで 解決 し ない に 決まっ て いる から、もう 諦めよう。
        english: Since it is surely not going to be resolved in the end, let's just give up.
        hint: 「に決まっている」 implies objective certainty. We're looking for an expression that conveys a subjective
          feeling of futility and resignation about an outcome.
    scene: Team members facing a seemingly insurmountable problem, leading to a sense of defeat.
    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic
    nuance: This sentence conveys a strong sense of resignation and futility. 「どうせ」 here implies that
      no matter what efforts are made, the problem 「解決 しない」 (kaiketsu shinai - won't be resolved), leading
      to the conclusion that it's better to 「諦めよう」 (akirameyou - give up). This falls under the 'どうせ +
      [statement about an inevitable outcome]' formation, specifically highlighting a negative and irreversible
      outcome. The phrase 「最後 まで 解決 しない」 (saigo made kaiketsu shinai) implies a problem that will remain
      unsolved to the very end, intensifying the feeling of futility. The causal connector 「ん だ から」 (n
      dakara) strengthens the link between the inevitable negative outcome and the proposed action of
      giving up. This usage often reflects a sense of exhaustion or powerlessness in the face of a persistent
      challenge, making any further effort seem pointless. The various Japanese forms offer different
      levels of casualness and emphasis, with 「諦める しか ない」 (akirameru shika nai) expressing a strong sense
      of having "no choice but to give up."
    etymology: The verb 「諦める」 (akirameru) means "to give up," "to abandon," or "to resign oneself." It
      combines the kanji for "clarify" (諦) and "see" (め), suggesting the act of seeing clearly that something
      is beyond one's control and letting go.
  - english: This plan will probably fail anyway.

          conviction about the inevitable failure of the plan.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 何しろ この 計画 は 失敗 する だろう。
        english: After all, this plan will probably fail.
        hint: 「何しろ」 provides a reason or explanation. We're looking for an expression that suggests an
          inevitable, often negative, outcome without necessarily providing a concrete reason.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: It is probably a fact that this plan will fail.

        hint: 「に決まっている」 states strong objective certainty. We're looking for an expression that conveys
          a subjective, resigned conviction about the inevitability of failure.
    scene: Colleagues discussing a risky project with low chances of success, and one expressing a fatalistic
      view.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: Here, 「どうせ」 signals a strong belief in the inevitable failure of the plan 「失敗 する」 (shippai
      suru), implying that the speaker sees any effort as pointless. The use of 「だろう」 softens the statement
      slightly to a strong conjecture rather than an absolute fact. This is another instance of the 'どうせ
      + [statement about an inevitable outcome]' formation. The speaker's use of 「どうせ」 communicates a
      deep-seated pessimism regarding the project's success, suggesting that they view any effort as futile,
      as failure is preordained. While the phrase 「だろう」 indicates probability, the preceding 「どうせ」 elevates
      this from a mere prediction to a resigned conviction. The phrase 「に 違い ない」 (ni chigai nai) further
      strengthens this sense of inevitability, sometimes used interchangeably with 「だろう」 after 「どうせ」 to
      convey absolute certainty from the speaker's perspective. The scene in a professional setting adds
      a layer of quiet cynicism often found when individuals feel powerless over outcomes. The varied
      Japanese options provide different degrees of certainty and casualness, but all retain the core
      nuance of resigned inevitability.
    etymology: The term 「計画」 (keikaku) meaning "plan" or "project" is a common noun in business and daily
      life, combining kanji for "measure/gauge" (計) and "to make/draw" (画).

        hint: 「に決まっている」 states strong objective certainty. We're looking for an expression that conveys
          a subjective, resigned conviction about a lack of receptiveness.
    scene: A parent expressing frustration about their rebellious child's unwillingness to heed advice.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: 「どうせ」 highlights the speaker's resignation to the fact that their words will be ignored, regardless
      of what they say. The phrase 「聞く 耳 を 持たない」 (kiku mimi o motanai) literally means 'doesn't have ears
      to listen', a common Japanese idiom for someone who refuses to listen or is unresponsive to advice.
      This exemplifies the 'どうせ + [statement about an inevitable outcome]' formation, conveying a deep,
      personal sense of futility when facing an unyielding recipient. The speaker's frustration is palpable,
      as they anticipate their words being disregarded no matter how they are delivered. The idiom 「聞く
      耳 を 持たない」 perfectly captures this state of imperviousness. The varying politeness levels in the
      Japanese translations (from casual 「聞かない よ」 to humble 「お 聞き いただけ ない でしょう」) show how 「どうせ」 can be
      adapted to different social contexts while retaining its core meaning of resigned certainty about
      a negative outcome. The final variant 「どうせ 無駄 だ」 (dōse muda da) explicitly states the futility of
      the effort.
    etymology: The idiom 「聞く 耳 を 持たない」 (kiku mimi o motanai) literally translates to "does not possess
      listening ears," emphasizing an intentional refusal or inability to listen or be receptive.

          of an unchangeable situation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の 言う こと なんて、誰 も 信じ て くれ ない に 決まっ て いる。
        english: No one is surely going to believe what I say.
        hint: 「に決まっている」 states strong objective certainty. We're looking for an expression that conveys
          a subjective, fatalistic acceptance of being disbelieved.
    scene: A person who has a history of making questionable statements or being doubted by others, expressing
      their resignation.
    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic
    nuance: Similar to previous examples, 「どうせ」 here expresses a fatalistic acceptance that the speaker's
      words 「信じて くれない」 (shinjite kurenai - won't be believed). The 「なんて」 after 「言う こと」 (iu koto - what
      I say) subtly devalues their own statements, reinforcing the sense of inevitable disbelief. This
      continues the pattern of 'どうせ + [statement about an inevitable outcome],' where the outcome is a
      deeply personal and negative perception of one's own credibility. The use of 「なんて」 after 「言う こと」
      or 「話」 (hanashi - story/talk) adds a tone of self-deprecation or dismissiveness, as if the speaker
      views their own contributions as inherently worthless or unbelievable to others. This reflects a
      profound sense of resignation, possibly stemming from past experiences of being doubted. The combination
      of 「どうせ」 with phrases like 「信じて くれない だろう」 (shinjite kurenai darou - probably won't believe me) or
      「信用 されない でしょう」 (shinyou sarenai deshou - probably won't be trusted) underscores the speaker's expectation
      that this negative pattern will continue, despite any efforts to gain trust. This nuance highlights
      a sense of being perpetually misunderstood or disbelieved.
    etymology: The verb 「信じる」 (shinjiru) means "to believe," and when paired with 「くれる」 (kureru) in 「信じて
      くれない」, it means "(someone) does not believe (for my benefit)," implying a lack of trust or credibility
      from others towards the speaker. 「信用 する」 (shinyou suru) means "to trust" or "to have confidence
      in."

          - 宝くじ なんて 当たる わけ ない よ。
        english: There's no way I'll win the lottery.
        hint: This is a direct statement of impossibility. We're looking for an expression that shows
          a resigned acceptance of this impossibility, despite engagement (e.g., buying a ticket).
      - competing_japanese:
          - 何しろ 宝くじ なんて 当たる わけ ない よ。
        english: After all, there's no way I'll win the lottery.
        hint: 「何しろ」 provides a reason or explanation. We're looking for an expression that shows a resigned
          certainty about an inevitable, often negative, outcome without requiring a concrete reason.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 宝くじ なんて 当たる わけ ない と いう の は 事実 だ よ。
        english: It is a fact that there's no way I'll win the lottery.
        hint: 「～というのは事実だ」 states an objective fact. We're looking for a subjective, fatalistic belief
          about the impossibility of winning.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 宝くじ なんて 当たる わけ ない に 決まっ て いる よ。
        english: It is surely the case that I won't win the lottery.
        hint: 「に決まっている」 states strong objective certainty. We're looking for an expression that conveys
          a subjective, fatalistic belief about the impossibility of winning.
    scene: Someone buying a lottery ticket while simultaneously expressing a complete lack of hope or
      expectation of winning.
    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic
    nuance: This example uses 「どうせ」 to convey a strong sense of resignation regarding a desirable but
      highly improbable outcome, such as winning the lottery 「当たる わけない」 (ataru wakenai - there's no way
      it will hit/win). It implies that the speaker accepts the low probability as an immutable fact.
      This is another example of 'どうせ + [statement about an inevitable outcome],' where the speaker's
      engagement with the action (buying a lottery ticket) is ironically paired with their profound belief
      in its futility. The phrase 「当たる わけ ない」 (ataru wake nai) is a strong negation, meaning "there's
      no way it will hit/win." The addition of 「なんて」 after 「宝くじ」 (takarakuji - lottery) adds a touch of
      disdain or dismissal towards the lottery itself, further emphasizing the speaker's conviction that
      it's a lost cause. This particular usage of 「どうせ」 captures a common human experience of engaging
      in an activity while fully expecting a negative or unlikely outcome, highlighting a detached resignation.
    etymology: The phrase 「当たる わけない」 (ataru wake nai) means "there's no way it will hit" or "it can't
      possibly be right." 「当たる」 (ataru) can mean "to hit" or "to win (a lottery)," while 「わけない」 (wake
      nai) is a common way to express impossibility or unlikelihood.

        hint: 「何しろ」 provides a reason or explanation for a situation. We're looking for an expression
          that signifies a resigned belief in an inevitable, often negative, outcome without a specific
          reason.

        english: It is a fact that even if I study, I will fail the exam.
        hint: 「～というのは事実だ」 states an objective fact. We're looking for a subjective feeling of inevitability
          and futility regarding one's efforts.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 勉強 し て も、試験 は 落ちる に 決まっ て いる。
        english: Even if I study, the exam is surely going to be failed.
        hint: 「に決まっている」 states strong objective certainty. We're looking for an expression that conveys
          a subjective feeling of inevitability and futility regarding one's efforts.
    scene: A student feeling demotivated before an exam, convinced that studying won't change the outcome.
    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic
    nuance: This example emphasizes the futility of effort when the outcome is perceived as inevitable.
      The phrase 「勉強 し て も」 (benkyou shite mo - even if I study) highlights the resignation despite potential
      effort, reinforcing that the speaker believes their efforts will be 「無駄」 (muda - pointless). This
      is another clear example of 'どうせ + [statement about an inevitable outcome],' specifically conveying
      a strong sense of futility regarding effort. The structure 「～て も」 (te mo - even if) preceding 「どうせ」
      reinforces the idea that even applying effort will not change the preordained negative outcome.
      This nuance is particularly common among students facing difficult exams, where past failures or
      perceived inability lead to a resigned outlook. The phrase 「無駄 だ」 (muda da - it's useless/pointless)
      explicitly states the futility, making the speaker's resignation very clear. This expression captures
      the essence of giving up before even trying, or trying without hope, because the outcome is seen
      as sealed.
    etymology: The word 「無駄」 (muda) means "useless," "futile," or "wasteful." It's a common な-adjective/noun
      used to describe something that produces no benefit or is an unproductive effort.
  - english: Anyway, if I clean up, it'll just get messy again soon.

    english_literally: Anyway, even if I clean up, it will scatter soon, so.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 片付け て も、すぐ 散らかる から。
        english: Even if I clean up, it'll just get messy again soon.
        hint: This is a simple conditional statement about a potential outcome. We're looking for an expression
          that conveys a sense of resignation that the effort is futile because the mess will inevitably
          return.
      - competing_japanese:
          - きっと 片付け て も、すぐ 散らかる から。
        english: Surely even if I clean up, it'll just get messy again soon.
        hint: 「きっと」 expresses strong certainty. We're looking for an expression that also implies a sense
          of resignation or futility about the inevitable outcome.
    scene: A person sighs, looking at their perpetually messy room.
    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic
    nuance: This usage of 「どうせ」 conveys the speaker's resignation and belief in the futility of cleaning,
      as messiness is seen as an inevitable outcome. The structure 「～ても」 (te mo - even if) further emphasizes
      that even with effort, the situation won't change. It's a common expression of passive acceptance
      towards a recurring, undesirable state.
    etymology: The verb 「散らかる」 (chirakaru) means "to be scattered; to be in disorder; to be messy." It
      describes the state of things being untidily spread around.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, 「どうせ」 is a versatile adverb for expressing resignation
  to an inevitable outcome, whether it's an undesired event, a perceived personal failing, or a pragmatic
  'might as well' scenario. Its distinct nuance lies in its implication that the outcome is predetermined,
  often rendering further effort pointless from the speaker's perspective. It effectively conveys a sense
  of futility, acceptance, or cynical prediction across various contexts.
