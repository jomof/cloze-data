    "etymology": "ここ originates from the demonstrative series *ko-so-a-do* (こそあど), where *ko* (こ) indicates proximity to the speaker. It is the place-related term corresponding to *kore* (これ, this).",
    "writeup": "ここ is one of the forms of the これ family of words used to identify things close to the speaker. In this case it demonstrates a place. In the same way that これ represents 'this', ここ represents 'this place', or simply 'here'.Fun FactThe full family of words used for identification/demonstration in Japanese are referred to as こそあど 言葉 (KO, SO, A, DO words). These include all of the different forms of これ , それ , あれ , and どれ .Cautionここ should not be confused with こっち, a similar word which is also sometimes translated as 'here'. こっち focuses more on the direction that one is/is going, while ここ focuses purely on 'this (stationary) place'.",
