    "etymology": "ここ originates from the demonstrative series ko-so-a-do (こそあど), where ko (こ) indicates proximity to the speaker. It is the place-related term corresponding to kore (これ, this).",
    "writeup": "ここ is one of the forms of the これ family of words used to identify things close to the speaker. In this case, it demonstrates a place. In the same way that これ represents 'this', ここ represents 'this place', or simply 'here'. The full family of words used for identification/demonstration in Japanese are referred to as ko-so-a-do Kotoba (KO, SO, A, DO words). These include all of the different forms of これ, それ, あれ, and どれ.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\nここ should not be confused with こっち, a similar word which is also sometimes translated as 'here'. こっち focuses more on the direction that one is/is going, while ここ focuses purely on 'this (stationary) place'.",

            "nuance": "「すみません」 is a polite way to start a question. 「ここ」 points directly to the immediate vicinity, suitable for asking about a specific establishment's location to a passerby you don't know, hence the formal register for the speaker and listener. There is no specific Japanese that would indicate 'male' or 'female' in this example."
