meaning: To convey (a message), to report, to tell (information to someone). It emphasizes the act of
  transmitting information.
pronunciation:
  katakana: トツタエル
  romaji: to tsutaeru
formation:
  '[Quoted content] と + 伝える (つたえる)': To convey or report the quoted content, emphasizing the content of
    the message.
  '[Information] を + 伝える (つたえる)': To convey specific information or feelings, focusing on the information
    itself.
  '[Person に] + [Information を] + 伝える (つたえる)': To convey information to a specific person, highlighting
    the recipient.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The verb 伝える (つたえる) originates from 伝う (つたう), meaning "to go along" or "to travel along." This
  root reflects the idea of something being passed along or moving from one point to another. The quotative
  particle と (to) signifies the content of what is being passed along. Thus, と伝える literally means "to
  pass along (that) X," highlighting the act of transmission of a specific message.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point と伝える (to tsutaeru) is used to express the act of **conveying**, **reporting**, or **telling** a message or information to someone. The と particle functions as a quotative marker, indicating that the preceding clause is the content being conveyed. While 言う (いう) simply means "to say," 伝える (つたえる) carries a distinct nuance of **transmission** or **delivery** of information, often implying that the speaker is acting as a messenger or is responsible for ensuring the information reaches its intended recipient. This makes と伝える particularly useful when relaying messages, news, feelings, or instructions from one party to another.

  The choice between と伝える and other verbs like 言う or 話す often depends on the speaker's emphasis. If the focus is on the act of *delivering* a message from one party to another, 伝える is more appropriate. If it's simply about the act of *speaking* or *stating* something generally, 言う or 話す might be used. For higher levels of politeness or humility, especially in business contexts when conveying information on behalf of someone else, humble forms like お伝えします (otsutae shimasu) or お伝えいたします (otsutae itashimasu) can be used.

  - term: 言う (いう)
    meaning: to say, to speak
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 言う is a general verb for speaking or stating. と伝える specifically implies *conveying* a message

      言う something to yourself, but you 伝える something *to someone*.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:言う (to say)
  - term: 話す (はなす)
    meaning: to speak, to talk
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 話す focuses on the act of conversation or communication in general, often implying a two-way
      exchange. と伝える is about the one-way transmission of a specific piece of information or message.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:話す (to talk)
  - term: 教える (おしえる)
    meaning: to teach, to tell (information/instruction)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 教える involves conveying information, it specifically implies imparting knowledge, instructions,
      or teaching a skill. と伝える is broader, referring to relaying any kind of message or information,
      without the pedagogical implication.

  - term: 報告する (ほうこくする)
    meaning: to report (formally)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 報告する is a more formal and specific term for making a report, often summarizing findings or
      developments in a structured way (e.g., a business report, a police report). と伝える is more general
      and can apply to informal messages as well as formal ones. 報告する often implies a superior-subordinate
      relationship or an official context.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:報告する (to report)
post_false_friends_writeup: While these verbs all involve communication, と伝える distinguishes itself by
  focusing on the active delivery of a message from one point to another, often with the speaker acting
  as an intermediary. 言う is the most general "to say," 話す implies a conversational exchange, and 教える specifically
  means to impart knowledge or instruction. 報告する is a more formal and structured act of reporting specific
  findings. Understanding these subtle differences is key to choosing the most natural and appropriate
  verb in Japanese.

          We're looking for the nuance that the painting effectively communicates the artist's passion
          to the observer.
    scene: Art critique.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    nuance: In this context, 「伝えている」 means the painting 'expresses' or 'communicates' the artist's passion,
      indicating that the emotion is evident through the artwork. Using 「が」 instead of 「は」 can put more
      emphasis on the painting as the conveyer of the passion.
post_example_writeup: These examples demonstrate how と伝える is used across various contexts, from direct
  message relay to conveying abstract concepts like feelings or traditions. The specific conjugation of
  伝える will adjust the formality, tense, and aspect of the conveyance. Remember, the core idea is the active
  transmission of information or a message.
