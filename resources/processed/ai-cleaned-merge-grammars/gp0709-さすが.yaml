        "part-of-speech": "adverb",
        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "General use",
        "function": "Expresses the speaker's strong feeling that something has turned out as expected, often with admiration.",
        "nuance": "Can convey admiration for expected qualities, or a negative sense of 'even' when an expected standard isn't met."
    },
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「さすが」 is debated, but one theory suggests it originates from 「然様 (sayō)」, meaning \"that way\" or \"as it is.\" Over time, it evolved to express a feeling of agreement or acceptance of a situation, eventually taking on the meaning of \"as one would expect.\"",
    "writeup": "「さすが」, often written as 「流石」, is an adverb that expresses the speaker's feeling of being impressed that something has lived up to its reputation or what was expected. It conveys a sense of admiration or acknowledgment that someone or something is living up to their potential or reputation. In English, this translates to \"as expected,\" \"that's just like (A),\" or \"impressive.\"\n\nAs 「さすが」 is an adverb, it can appear at the beginning of a sentence, often followed by 「に」, or directly before a noun with 「の」. For example, 「さすがに」 emphasizes the expected outcome in a given situation.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   While generally positive, 「さすが」 can occasionally carry a negative nuance, similar to \"even\" in English. This implies that even someone or something exceptional couldn't overcome a particular challenge, expressing a sense of disappointment or resignation.\n*   The kanji form 「流石」 is an example of 「借字 (shakuji)」, where the kanji's meaning is unrelated to the word's actual meaning.",

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「さすが」, 「はたして」 is more often used to express doubt or questioning before an event happens, or to confirm a result after it has occurred. 「さすが」 is more about acknowledging inherent qualities or expected outcomes."

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「やはり」 is generally more objective, indicating that something is simply \"as expected\" or \"after all,\" often confirming a prior thought or common knowledge. 「さすが」 carries a stronger sense of admiration or an implied higher standard being met, or a specific exception being noted (as in \"even X\")."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「さすが」, 「はたして」, and 「やはり」 can express a sense of \"as expected,\" it's important to distinguish their nuances. Use 「さすが」 when you want to convey admiration or acknowledge someone's inherent qualities, abilities, or reputation, or to note an exceptional case. Use 「はたして」 when you are wondering if something is really true, or to confirm whether something happened as expected. Use 「やはり」 when you are objectively confirming something that was expected or that turned out to be the case after all.",
