    "etymology": "The etymology of 「さすが」 is debated, but one theory suggests it originates from 「然様 (sayō)」, meaning \"that way\" or \"as it is.\" Over time, it evolved to express a feeling of agreement or acceptance of a situation, eventually taking on the meaning of \"as one would expect.\"",
    "writeup": "「さすが」, often written as 「流石」, is an adverb that expresses the speaker's feeling of being impressed that something has lived up to its reputation or what was expected. It conveys a sense of admiration or acknowledgment that someone or something is living up to their potential or reputation. In English, this translates to \"as expected,\" \"that's just like (A),\" or \"impressive.\"\n\nAs 「さすが」 is an adverb, it can appear at the beginning of a sentence, often followed by 「に」, or directly before a noun with 「の」. For example, 「さすがに」 emphasizes the expected outcome in a given situation.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   While generally positive, 「さすが」 can occasionally carry a negative nuance, similar to \"even\" in English. This implies that even someone or something exceptional couldn't overcome a particular challenge, expressing a sense of disappointment or resignation.\n*   The kanji form 「流石」 is an example of 「借字 (shakuji)」, where the kanji's meaning is unrelated to the word's actual meaning.",

        "violation: Modified `speaker_gender`, `listener_gender`, and `nuance` fields in several examples to strictly adhere to Rule 6's requirement that 'If there is a \"speaker_gender\" or \"listener_gender\", then \"nuance\" **must** mention the specific Japanese, in 「quotes」, that would only be spoken by that gender.' This involved removing these fields where no such gender-specific language was present, and for the remaining examples, adjusting the Japanese phrases or rephrasing the `nuance` to explicitly point to gendered language or usage (e.g., adding 「だわ」 for female speech, justifying male speech with 「な」 or 「君」 usage)."
