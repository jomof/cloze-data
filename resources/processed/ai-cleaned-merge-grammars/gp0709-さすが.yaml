    "etymology": "The etymology of 「さすが」 is debated, but one theory suggests it comes from 「然様 (sayō)」, meaning \"that way\" or \"like that\", which evolved to express agreement or acknowledgment, eventually taking on the nuance of \"as expected\". The kanji 「流石」 are ateji (当て字), characters used for their phonetic value rather than their meaning.",
    "writeup": "「さすが」, also often written as 「流石」, is an adverb expressing the speaker's feeling of being impressed that something has lived up to its reputation or expectations. It translates to \"as expected of (A)\" or \"that is just like (A)\". 「さすが」 can appear at the beginning of a phrase, sometimes with 「に」, or directly before a noun with 「の」. Though less common, 「さすが」 can have a negative connotation, similar to \"even\" in English, implying that even (A) couldn't (B). The kanji 「流石」 is an example of 借字 (shakuji), where the kanji's meaning is unrelated to the word's meaning.",
