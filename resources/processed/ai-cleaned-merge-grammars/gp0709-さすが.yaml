    },
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「さすが」 is debated, but one theory suggests it originates from 「然様 (sayō)」, meaning \"that way\" or \"as it is.\" Over time, it evolved to express a feeling of agreement or acceptance of a situation, eventually taking on the meaning of \"as one would expect.\"",
    "writeup": "「さすが」, often written as 「流石」, is an adverb that expresses the speaker's feeling of being impressed that something has lived up to its reputation or what was expected. It conveys a sense of admiration or acknowledgment that someone or something is living up to their potential or reputation. In English, this translates to \"as expected,\" \"that's just like (A),\" or \"impressive.\"\n\nAs 「さすが」 is an adverb, it can appear at the beginning of a sentence, often followed by 「に」, or directly before a noun with 「の」. For example, 「さすがに」 emphasizes the expected outcome in a given situation.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   While generally positive, 「さすが」 can occasionally carry a negative nuance, similar to \"even\" in English. This implies that even someone or something exceptional couldn't overcome a particular challenge, expressing a sense of disappointment or resignation.\n*   The kanji form 「流石」 is an example of 「借字 (shakuji)」, where the kanji's meaning is unrelated to the word's actual meaning.",

Use 「はたして」 when you are wondering if something is really true, or to confirm whether something happened as expected.
