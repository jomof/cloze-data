    "etymology": "じゃ is a contraction of では. あるまいし combines the verb ある (to be) with the negative volitional auxiliary verb まい (implying 'not likely to be') and the conjunctive particle し (indicating a reason or cause). The overall structure implies 'it's not as if it's the case that..., so...'",
    "writeup": "じゃあるまいし is used to express that something is not the case, and therefore a certain action or behavior is inappropriate or surprising. It carries a nuance of criticism or disbelief that someone is acting as if a particular condition were true when it is not.\n\n*   It can be translated as \"You are not..., so...\" or \"It's not..., so...\"\n*   It's often used to point out that someone is behaving immaturely or making a mistake that they should know better than to make.\n*   The part before じゃあるまいし states what is *not* the case, and the part after expresses the speaker's opinion or criticism.",
