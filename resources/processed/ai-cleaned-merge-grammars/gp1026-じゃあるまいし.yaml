    "writeup": "The expression 「じゃあるまいし」 is used to convey that something is not the case, and therefore a particular behavior or expectation is inappropriate. It carries a nuance of criticism or mild disapproval.\n\n*   It's similar to saying \"It's not like you're X, so you shouldn't Y.\"\n*   「じゃ」is a colloquial contraction of 「では」.\n*   「あるまいし」 is derived from the verb 「ある」 (to be) combined with 「まい」 (a volitional negative auxiliary verb) and the particle 「し」 (indicating reason). The literal sense is something like, \"It's not as if it's going to be...\" \n*   「じゃあるまいし」 follows nouns or nominalized phrases (phrases turned into nouns using particles like 「の」).\n*   The statement following 「じゃあるまいし」 expresses the speaker's negative opinion regarding the situation.",
    "etymology": "「じゃ」 is a contraction of 「では」. 「あるまいし」 combines 「ある」 (to be) with the negative volitional 「まい」 and the reason particle 「し」. It essentially means \"it's not as if... so...\"",
