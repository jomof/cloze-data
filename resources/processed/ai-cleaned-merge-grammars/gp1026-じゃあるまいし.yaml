        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "General usage, often in conversations where the speaker is expressing disapproval or criticism.",
        "function": "To criticize behavior or an attitude by pointing out that the premise for such behavior (implied by the preceding clause) is clearly false or inappropriate.",
        "nuance": "Carries a strong tone of exasperation, reproach, or indignation, implying that the listener's action is unfitting or absurd given the reality. It often suggests a lack of common sense or maturity on the part of the listener."
    },
    "etymology": "The expression 「じゃあるまいし」 is a combination of several linguistic elements. 「じゃ」 is a colloquial contraction of the particle 「では」, indicating a condition or contrast. 「ある」 is the plain form of the verb 'to be'. 「まい」 is an auxiliary verb indicating negative volition or conjecture, similar to 'would not' or 'not likely'. Finally, 「し」 is a conjunctive particle used to state a reason or add emphasis. Together, these elements form a phrase that literally means 'it is not as if [X], so therefore [Y]', where Y is a criticism or observation of an inappropriate action or attitude.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「じゃあるまいし」 is a highly expressive and critical phrase used to convey that a certain situation or identity is **not** the case, and therefore, the subsequent behavior or expectation is inappropriate, illogical, or even absurd. It's akin to saying, \"You're not X, so why are you acting like Y?\" or \"It's not X, so this Y is ridiculous.\"\n\nThis expression is predominantly used in casual conversation and carries a strong nuance of reproach, exasperation, or indignation. The speaker uses it to point out a disparity between the listener's (or a situation's) reality and their actions, often implying a lack of common sense, maturity, or understanding.\n\n**Formation:**\n「じゃあるまいし」 primarily attaches to nouns, but it can also follow nominalized phrases, especially those ending with 「わけ」. The basic structure asserts that the preceding element (Noun, or a nominalized clause with 「わけ」) is false or not applicable to the current situation, leading to the speaker's critical judgment.\n\n**Usage Nuances:**\n*   **Criticism and Disapproval:** The core function is to criticize. It's not a neutral statement but a direct challenge to the appropriateness of someone's actions.\n*   **Implied Premise:** It works by denying an implied premise. For instance, if someone is crying over a small scratch, you might say 「赤ちゃんじゃあるまいし」 (You're not a baby, so...). The implied premise denied is 'you are a baby', which would justify crying.\n*   **Common in Rebukes:** You'll frequently hear it when someone is scolding or gently rebuking another person, often a younger person or someone acting immaturely.\n*   **Colloquial Nature:** While grammatically sound, its usage tends to be more colloquial and direct, making it suitable for casual or semi-formal contexts rather than highly formal or deferential speech.\n\nThe clause following 「じゃあるまいし」 typically expresses the speaker's opinion, often in the form of a command, a suggestion, or a rhetorical question, highlighting the inappropriateness of the behavior. The sentence structure generally concludes with a negative connotation regarding the criticized action.",
