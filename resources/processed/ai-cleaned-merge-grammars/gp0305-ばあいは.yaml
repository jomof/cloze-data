    "writeup": "「場合は (baai wa)」 translates to \"in the event of (A)\" or \"in the case of (A).\" 「場合 (baai)」 by itself means \"case\" or \"situation.\" This grammar point is used to highlight a hypothetical situation or a characteristic of another person, often in contrast to something already being discussed. Be mindful that since 「場合」 carries a nuance of randomness, it's not suitable for describing regularly occurring or planned events.",
