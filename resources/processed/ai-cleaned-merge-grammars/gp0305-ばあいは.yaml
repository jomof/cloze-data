    "etymology": "「場合 (baai)」 means 'case' or 'situation.' It is composed of 場 (ba, 'place, scene') and 合 (ai, 'fit, meet'). The combination implies 'a fitting situation' or 'a meeting of circumstances'. 「は (wa)」 is the topic marker, indicating that the preceding case or situation is the topic of discussion.",
    "writeup": "「場合は (baai wa)」 functions as a conditional expression that translates to \"in the event of (A)\" or \"in the case of (A).\" It is used to specify a particular situation under which the following statement holds true. The core of this expression, 「場合 (baai)」, literally means 'case' or 'situation' on its own. When used with the topic particle 「は (wa)」, it emphasizes the specific condition being discussed.\n\nThis grammatical structure can follow various parts of speech:\n-   **Verbs**: Connect directly to the plain (dictionary, past, negative, or negative past) form of a verb. For example, 「食べる場合 (taberu baai)」 means 'in the event of eating'.\n-   **い-Adjectives**: Connect directly to the plain form of an い-adjective. For example, 「寒い場合 (samui baai)」 means 'in the event that it's cold'.\n-   **な-Adjectives**: Require the particle 「な (na)」 before 「場合」. For example, 「危険な場合 (kiken na baai)」 means 'in the event that it's dangerous'.\n-   **Nouns**: Require the particle 「の (no)」 before 「場合」. For example, 「私の場合は (watashi no baai wa)」 means 'in my case'.\n\n「場合は」 is frequently employed to discuss hypothetical scenarios or to highlight a specific viewpoint or characteristic of a person, especially when contrasting it with something already in discussion. This contrastive nuance stems from the particle 「は」.\n\nAn important distinction to grasp is that 「場合は」 implies a certain degree of randomness or contingency in the situation. Consequently, it is generally not used for events that occur regularly or are easily planned or controlled. For routine or scheduled occurrences, expressions like 「とき (toki)」 are more appropriate.",

If the condition invariably leads to a result, use 「と」. When stating a viewpoint or benefit for someone, 「にとって」 is the correct choice, not 「場合は」.",
