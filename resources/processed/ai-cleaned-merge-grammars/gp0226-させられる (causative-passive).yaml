    },
    "etymology": "The causative-passive form is a compound grammatical construction. It derives from the combination of the causative auxiliary verb 「せる/させる」, which indicates causing or allowing an action, and the passive auxiliary verb 「られる」, which indicates being the recipient of an action. Thus, 「させられる」 literally means \"to be caused to do\" or \"to be made to do,\" reflecting a sequential application of these grammatical functions. Its evolution stems from the need to express situations where one is compelled to act.",
    "writeup": "The causative-passive form, **させられる** (or **せられる** for Group 1 verbs), is a grammatical construction used to express that the subject is **made to do** something or **forced to do** something by another agent. This form combines the meaning of the causative (making someone do something) with the passive (being acted upon), resulting in the subject experiencing the compulsion to act. Sentences using this form are typically from the perspective of the person who has *been made to do* something, and they often carry a negative connotation, indicating that the action was against the subject's will or caused them inconvenience.The formation rules are as follows: For **Group 1 verbs (u-verbs)**, the final 『う』 sound of the verb is changed to its 『あ』 equivalent, and then **せられる** is added. For example, 読む (yomu, to read) becomes 読ませられる (yomaserareru, to be made to read). For **Group 2 verbs (ru-verbs)**, **させられる** is added directly to the verb stem. For example, 食べる (taberu, to eat) becomes 食べさせられる (tabesaserareru, to be made to eat).**Irregular verbs** have special forms: する (suru, to do) becomes **させられる** (saserareru, to be made to do). 来る (kuru, to come) becomes **来させられる** (kosaserareru, to be made to come).In a causative-passive sentence, the agent who *forces* or *makes* the subject do something is typically marked with the particle **に**. The subject who is *being forced* to do the action is marked with **が**. This is a reversal of the agent-subject marking seen in the simple causative form.It is important to note that the shorter passive form **れる** cannot be used in place of **られる** in causative-passive sentences. This is because both **せる** and **させる** end with an 『え』 sound kana (`せ`) when they connect with the passive ending. This rule applies to all verbs that have an 『え』 sound kana at their conjugation point (excluding the potential use of **れる** and **られる**).",

It can be used for the direct passive voice (\"to be done to\"), the indirect or adversative passive (where one is negatively affected by another's action), or even to express potential (\"can do\") or honorifics when attached to certain verb stems. Pay close attention to the verb's stem form (whether it's an a-form + せられる or stem + させられる) and the particles used (especially 「に」 to mark the agent of compulsion) to accurately distinguish the causative-passive from these other forms.",
