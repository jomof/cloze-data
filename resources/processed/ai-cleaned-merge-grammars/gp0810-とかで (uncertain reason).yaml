examples:
  - english: I heard Tanaka is sick or something, so he won't be coming today.
    japanese:
      - 田中 さん は 病気 {と か で}、今日 は 来 ませ ん。
      - 田中 は 病気 {と か で}、今日 来 ない。
    english_literally: Tanaka is sick or something, so today won't come.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 田中 さん は 病気 だ から、今日 は 来 ませ ん。
        english: Tanaka won't be coming today because he's sick.
        hint: Using 「から」 indicates that the speaker is certain about the reason. We're looking for a phrasing
          that implies the reason is uncertain or based on hearsay.
    scene: Telling someone why a colleague is absent.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The speaker, a man, is informing a woman about Tanaka's absence. The phrasing itself does
      not contain gender-specific language, making it suitable for a general exchange of information between
      individuals. The use of 「とかで」 implies that the information about Tanaka's sickness is based on something
      the speaker heard, not a confirmed fact.
  - english: I'm thinking of trying out the new restaurant because I heard it's good or something.
    japanese:
      - 新しい レストラン が 美味しい {と か で}、行っ て みよう と 思っ て い ます。
      - 新しい レストラン が 美味しい {と か で}、行っ て みよう と 思っ てる。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新しい レストラン が 美味しい らしい から、行っ て みよう と 思っ て い ます。
        english: I'm thinking of trying out the new restaurant because it seems it's good.
        hint: 「らしい から」 indicates a reason based on reliable hearsay. We're looking for a vaguer, more
          uncertain reason, implying 'something like that'.
    scene: Suggesting a place to eat based on a rumor.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker, a woman, is sharing her thoughts with a man. The phrase 「～と 思って い ます」 is a polite
      way to express one's intention or thought, usable by any gender. The use of 「とかで」 implies the information
      about the restaurant's deliciousness is based on informal reports, adding a speculative tone.
  - english: She's been saying she's busy with work or something, so she hasn't been hanging out with
      me lately.

      - 彼女 は 仕事 が 忙しい {と か で}、最近 全然 遊ん で くれ ない。
    english_literally: She is busy with work or something, so recently does not hang out with me at all.

          - 彼女 は 仕事 が 忙しい って、最近 全然 遊ん で くれ ませ ん。
        english: She says she's busy with work, so she hasn't been hanging out with me lately.
        hint: 「って」 is a casual way to quote what someone said, but it doesn't carry the nuanced uncertainty
          of 「とかで」 regarding the truth of the reason.
    scene: Complaining to a friend about someone's unavailability.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: A man is expressing his dissatisfaction to a woman regarding his friend's unavailability.
      The phrasing 「遊ん で くれ ませ ん」 conveys a feeling of being let down, and the use of 「とかで」 suggests the
      speaker views the reason provided for the friend's busyness with some skepticism or as an unverified
      excuse.
  - english: I heard he got a new girlfriend or something, he seems really happy lately.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 新しい 彼女 が でき た {と か で}、最近 すごく 幸せ そう だ ね。
      - 彼 は 新しい 彼女 が でき た {と か で}、最近 すごく 幸せ そう だ よ。

          - 彼 は 新しい 彼女 が でき た らしい、最近 すごく 幸せ そう だ ね。
        english: It seems he got a new girlfriend, he seems really happy lately.
        hint: 「らしい」 conveys a sense of probability or conjecture based on indirect evidence. While similar,
          「とかで」 emphasizes the reason for an outcome, often with a hint of vagueness or hearsay about
          that reason.
    scene: Gossiping about a friend's happiness.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: A woman is discussing a mutual friend with a man. The informal ending 「～ね」 is typical for
      casual conversation between friends. By using 「とかで」, the speaker indicates that the information
      about the friend's new girlfriend is based on hearsay or rumor, rather than direct confirmation.
  - english: That store clerk always gives me extra service, saying it's because I'm cute or something.
    japanese:
      - あの 店員 さん は 私 が 可愛い {と か で}、いつ も サービス し て くれる ん だ。
      - あの 店員 さん は 私 が 可愛い {と か で}、いつ も サービス し て くれる の。

          - あの 店員 さん は 私 が 可愛い から、いつ も サービス し て くれる ん だ。
        english: That store clerk always gives me extra service because I'm cute.
        hint: Using 「から」 implies that the speaker is stating the reason as a definite fact. We're looking
          for a phrasing that expresses the reason with uncertainty or as a possible, perhaps flattered,
          interpretation.
    scene: A woman hinting at her appeal.
    register: casual
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: A woman is playfully sharing an observation with another woman. The casual ending 「～ん だ」 adds
      an informal, explanatory tone. The phrase 「私 が 可愛い とか で」 suggests the reason given by the store
      clerk is either an unconfirmed rumor or a lighthearted pretense by the speaker about the clerk's
      intentions, used to convey a modest or self-deprecating tone.
  - english: I heard you're very kind, so I was looking forward to meeting you.
    japanese:
      - 君 が すごく 優しい {と か で}、会う の が 楽しみ だっ た ん だ。

    english_literally: You are very kind or something, so meeting was fun.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 君 が すごく 優しい と 聞い て い た の で、会う の が 楽しみ だっ た ん だ。
        english: Because I heard you were very kind, I was looking forward to meeting you.
        hint: 「と 聞い て い た の で」 states explicitly that the reason is based on what was heard. 「とかで」 implies
          a less direct, more vague source of information, often just a general sense or rumor.
    scene: Meeting someone new at a social gathering.
    register: shitashii kuchō (intimate)
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: A man is expressing his anticipation to a woman on a first date. The casual 「～だっ た ん だ」 adds
      a touch of personal sincerity. The use of 「とかで」 indicates the speaker heard about the listener's
      kindness indirectly, perhaps through their reputation or casual mentions, setting a warm, personal
      tone for their first interaction.
  - english: I heard that you are graduating, I'm going to be lonely.
    japanese:
      - 先輩 は 卒業 する {と か で}、寂しく なり ます ね。
      - 先輩 は ご 卒業 なさる {と か で}、寂しく なり ます ね。
    english_literally: Senior is graduating or something, so I will become lonely, right?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先輩 は 卒業 する と いう こと な の で、寂しく なり ます ね。
        english: Since it is said that our senior is graduating, I'm going to be lonely.
        hint: 「と いう こと な の で」 expresses a reason based on information or a fact, which can be hearsay
          but sounds more formal and factual than the vaguer 「とかで」.
    scene: A junior expressing sadness at a senior's departure.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: sympathetic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: A younger female student expresses sadness to an older female senior about her graduation.
      The phrase 「寂しく なり ます ね」 conveys a sympathetic and somewhat wistful feeling. The use of 「とかで」 implies
      the information about the graduation is based on hearsay, perhaps something overheard or passed
      around among students, rather than a direct announcement.
  - english: The president is supposedly expecting a lot from the new project, so everyone is working
      hard with enthusiasm.
    japanese:
      - 社長 が 新しい プロジェクト に 期待 し て いる {と か で}、皆 熱心 に 取り組ん で い ます。
      - 社長 が 新しい プロジェクト に 期待 なさっ て いる {と か で}、皆 熱心 に 取り組ん で い ます。

        english: Because I have heard that the president is expecting a lot from the new project, everyone
          is working hard with enthusiasm.
        hint: 「と 聞い て い ます の で」 is a more direct and formal way to state a reason based on what one has
          heard. 「とかで」 maintains a slightly more informal tone, even in a formal context, implying the
          information is 'rumored' or 'something like that'.
    scene: An employee discussing company expectations.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: A male employee is discussing company expectations with a male colleague. The sentence uses
      polite 「～て い ます」, appropriate for a professional setting. The phrase 「期待 し て いる とか で」 indicates
      that the information about the president's high expectations is based on workplace chatter or indirect
      communication, rather than direct instruction, adding a subtle nuance of unconfirmed information.
  - english: He said he had a cold or something, so he didn't come to school today.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 風邪 を 引い た {と か で}、今日 は 学校 に 来 ませ ん でし た。
      - 彼 は 風邪 引い た {と か で}、今日 学校 来 なかっ た。
    english_literally: He caught a cold or something, so today didn't come to school.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 風邪 を 引い た の で、今日 は 学校 に 来 ませ ん でし た。
        english: He didn't come to school today because he caught a cold.
        hint: 「の で」 states the reason directly and clearly. 「とかで」 suggests the reason is reported by someone
          else, or is not fully confirmed by the speaker.
    scene: A classmate explaining why another friend is absent.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: A female student explaining a classmate's absence to another female student. The use of 「とかで」
      implies that she heard this reason from someone else (maybe the absent student themselves, or another
      friend), and it's not her direct observation of their illness. It conveys a slight distance from
      the certainty of the reason.
  - english: The department store is having a big sale or something, so it's really crowded today.
    japanese:
      - デパート で 大 バーゲン {と か で}、今日 は すごく 混ん で いる ね。
      - デパート で 大 バーゲン {と か で}、今日 すごい 混ん でる よ。
    english_literally: At the department store, big bargain or something, so today is very crowded, right?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - デパート で 大 バーゲン な の で、今日 は すごく 混ん で いる ね。
        english: The department store is having a big sale, so it's really crowded today.
        hint: 「な の で」 directly states a known reason. 「とかで」 implies the speaker is guessing the reason
          or heard it vaguely, rather than confirming it.
    scene: Two friends walking past a crowded department store.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: Two male friends observing a busy department store. The use of 「とかで」 here indicates that the
      speaker is inferring the reason for the crowd (a big sale) or has heard it vaguely, rather than
      having confirmed it. It adds a touch of speculation to the observation. The sentence ending 「ね」
      seeks agreement.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「とかで」 is used across various contexts, from informal
  daily conversations to more formal professional settings, always retaining its core nuance of providing
  a reason that is uncertain, based on hearsay, or presented with a degree of vagueness. It allows the
  speaker to convey information without fully committing to the veracity of the reason, often implying
  that the information was acquired indirectly. Pay attention to the subtle differences in nuance when
  comparing it with more direct causal expressions like 「から」 and 「の で」.
