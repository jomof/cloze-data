id: gp9999
meaning: was doing (past progressive)・had done (resultative state)
pronunciation:
  katakana: テイタ
  romaji: te ita
formation:
  Verb[て] + いた: Indicates a state that began in the past and continued up to or was true at a point in
    the past (resultative state).
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  function: Expresses either an action that was in progress in the past or a state that resulted from
    a past action and continued.
  nuance: 'This form covers two distinct meanings: ongoing action in the past (past progressive) and a
    state resulting from a past action that was true at some point in the past (resultative). The specific
    meaning is usually clear from context.'
  grammatical-role: Modifies the verb to indicate past aspectual information.
etymology: The 〜て form serves as a conjunctive or gerundive form of verbs, indicating a connection between
  actions or states. いる (iru) means "to exist" for animate objects, and by extension, "to be in a state
  of." Historically, 居る (iru) was used for living things, while 有る (aru) for inanimate things. The combination
  〜て + いる evolved to express continuous action or a resultant state. When いる became いた (its past form),
  it naturally extended these meanings into the past. So, 〜ていた literally means "was in the state of [verb]-ing"
  or "was in the state resulting from [verb]-ing."
writeup: 'Verb[ていた] is the past tense of Verb[ている]. Like its present tense counterpart, 〜ていた has two primary
  uses: expressing an action that was in progress in the past, often referred to as the past progressive
  or past continuous, and expressing a state that resulted from a past action and was true at a particular
  point in the past. The context in which it is used typically clarifies which meaning is intended. For
  instance, if you say 「ご飯 を {食べていた}。」, it could mean "I was eating a meal" (ongoing action) or "I had
  already eaten a meal" (resultative state, implying the meal was finished and the state of having eaten
  continued). Understanding the core verb and the surrounding context is crucial for disambiguating these
  meanings. This grammar point is fundamental for describing past events and states in Japanese, adding
  depth and precision to narratives.'

  - term: Verb[た]
    meaning: did
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Verb[た] simply indicates a completed action in the past. Verb[ていた] implies either an ongoing
      action at a past point or a state that resulted from a past action and continued. It provides more
      detail about the temporal aspect or the lasting consequence.
    grammar_point: Verb[た] (past tense)
  - term: Verb[ている]
    meaning: is doing・has done
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Verb[ている] describes actions ongoing in the present or states resulting from past actions that
      are true now. Verb[ていた] shifts these same concepts into the past. It provides the same pattern,
      just a different temporal frame.
    grammar_point: Verb[ている・てる] (progressive・resultative)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'The distinction between 〜た and 〜ていた often lies in whether the focus is simply
  on the completion of an action (〜た) or on the process of an action at a past point in time, or a state
  that existed in the past as a result of a prior action (〜ていた). When considering 〜ている versus 〜ていた, remember
  that いる indicates present existence or state, while いた indicates past existence or state. Therefore,
  the choice depends entirely on the timeframe you wish to convey: present ongoing/resultant state vs.
  past ongoing/resultant state.'
