  romaji: te ita
formation:
  Verbて形 + いた: Indicates an action that was ongoing in the past or a state that existed as a result of
    a past action.
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  temporal-flow: Describes actions or states that persisted over a period in the past.
  spatial-flow: Implies a state or action that was maintained in a particular location in the past. (e.g.,
    窓が開いていた - The window was open.)
etymology: The grammatical form Verb + 「ている」 is a contraction of 「て」 (the conjunctive form of a verb)
  and 「いる」 (the verb meaning 'to exist' or 'to be located'). Originally, this construction emphasized
  the result of an action. Over time, it evolved to also express ongoing actions. When 「いる」 is conjugated
  to its past form 「いた」, the entire construction 「ていた」 shifts the temporal reference to the past, indicating
  either an action that was in progress at a past point in time or a state that had resulted from a past
  action and continued to exist in the past.
writeup: "The grammar point 「ていた」 is the past tense form of 「ている」. It describes actions or states that\
  \ existed or were ongoing at a specific point in the past. Understanding its usage is crucial for accurately\
  \ describing past events in Japanese. There are three primary uses for 「ていた」:\n\n1.  **Past Progressive\
  \ Action**: This is similar to the English past continuous tense (e.g., \"was doing\"). It describes\
  \ an action that was in progress at some point in the past.\n    *   Example: 彼は昨日の夜、テレビを**見ていました**。\
  \ (He **was watching** TV last night.)\n\n2.  **Habitual Action in the Past**: 「ていた」 can also describe\
  \ actions that were regularly performed or habits that existed in the past, but are no longer necessarily\
  \ true in the present. This often appears with adverbs like 「いつも」 (always) or 「よく」 (often).\n    * \
  \  Example: 学生の時、毎日 図書館で**勉強していました**。 (When I was a student, I **used to study** at the library every\
  \ day.)\n\n3.  **Resultant State in the Past**: This describes a state that resulted from a past action\
  \ and continued to exist up to or at a specific point in the past. This is particularly common with\
  \ intransitive verbs that describe a change of state (e.g., 開く 'to open' becoming 開いている 'is open').\
  \ When referring to something that was placed or prepared, transitive verbs combined with 「てある」 (which\
  \ becomes 「てあった」 in the past) are generally used, but 「ていた」 can also describe the resultant state of\
  \ something that has stopped or changed. \n    *   Example: 窓が**開いていた**。 (The window **was open**.)\
  \ – meaning it was opened at some point and remained in that state.\n\nIt is important to distinguish\
  \ 「ていた」 from the simple past tense 「た」 form. While 「た」 simply states that an action was completed in\
  \ the past, 「ていた」 emphasizes the *duration*, *continuation*, or *persistence* of an action or state\
  \ in the past. For example, 「食べた」 means \"ate\" (a completed action), whereas 「食べていた」 means \"was eating\"\
  \ (an ongoing action)."

  - term: Verb[て]いる
    meaning: present progressive / resultant state
    kind: similar expression

      shifts this temporal reference to the past.

  - term: Verb[た]ことがある
    meaning: have the experience of doing something
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Verb[た]ことがある specifically denotes having the experience of doing an action at least once.
      Verb[ていた] describes an action that was in progress or a state that existed at a specific time in
      the past, without necessarily implying an accumulated experience.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-た]ことがある (experience of having done)'
  - term: Verb[た]ところだ
    meaning: just finished doing
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Verb[た]ところだ signifies that an action was completed very recently. Verb[ていた] describes an action
      that was ongoing or a state that existed at some point in the past, not its immediate completion.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-た]ところだ (just finished doing)'
  - term: Verb[つつある]
    meaning: is in the process of (gradually changing)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Verb[つつある] (or its past form Verb[つつあった]) implies a more formal or literary expression for
      a gradual, ongoing process of change. Verb[ていた] is a more general and common form for any continuous
      action or state in the past.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Verb-stem]つつある (gradual process)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「ていた」 covers a broad range of past continuous and resultant states,
  other expressions specify different nuances. For example, the simple past 「た」 form focuses on completion
  rather than duration. 「ている」 describes present states or ongoing actions, while 「ていた」 moves this to the
  past. When discussing past experiences, 「たことがある」 is used. For actions that were just completed, 「たところだ」
  is appropriate. Finally, 「つつあった」 (the past form of 「つつある」) is a more formal way to describe a gradual,
  ongoing process in the past, often implying a slow development rather than a simple continuous action.
