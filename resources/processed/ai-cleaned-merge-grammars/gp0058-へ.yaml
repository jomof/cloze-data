    "etymology": "The particle へ originates from the verb 「経 (へ)」, meaning \"to pass through\" or \"to go via\". This etymology highlights the particle's core function of indicating direction and movement towards a destination.",
    "writeup": "へ is a particle used when describing a place that someone or something is moving toward or in contact with. In many cases, the particles に and へ are interchangeable, but there is a slight difference in nuance. へ focuses more on the distance/effort required to get between (A) and (B), while に focuses more on the connection between (A) and (B). へ always comes after the noun signifying the destination.\n\nWhile they may seem the same at first glance, へ shows that there is a space between (A) and (B), while に puts the emphasis solely on the destination. This is why common expressions such as 「city/country name へ ようこそ」 sound very polite. It is like saying, \"Welcome, and we acknowledge your journey/effort to get here.\"\n\nIn the TV-show example, this commonly means \"thank you for your effort to watch this particular show, out of all the ones you could have chosen.\"",
