        "usage-context": "Used to indicate the destination or direction of movement, often with an emphasis on the journey or the act of moving rather than just the endpoint.",
        "function": "Marks the target or direction of verbs of motion (e.g., 行く, 来る, 帰る, 進む) and verbs of sending/giving (e.g., 送る, 出す, あげる).",
        "nuance": "Compared to に, へ places more emphasis on the path or the act of moving towards a destination, rather than simply the destination itself. It can also imply a sense of respect or acknowledgment of effort, particularly in expressions like ようこそ. It is also used metaphorically for actions directed toward a person or entity, such as sending a letter 'to' someone or directing a question 'to' someone, emphasizing the 'flow' of the action. This particle can be used by any gender or age and is appropriate across various registers, though its nuance of emphasizing a journey can lend it a slightly more formal or poetic feel in some contexts compared to に, which is often more neutral about the journey itself, simply stating the destination."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle へ originates from the verb 「経 (へ)」, meaning \"to pass through\" or \"to go via\". This etymology highlights the particle's core function of indicating direction and movement towards a destination.",
    "writeup": "へ is a particle used when describing a place that someone or something is moving toward or in contact with. In many cases, the particles に and へ are interchangeable, but there is a slight difference in nuance. へ focuses more on the distance/effort required to get between (A) and (B), while に focuses more on the connection between (A) and (B). へ always comes after the noun signifying the destination. While they may seem the same at first glance, へ shows that there is a space between (A) and (B), while に puts the emphasis solely on the destination. This is why common expressions such as 「city/country name へ ようこそ」 sound very polite. It is like saying, \"Welcome, and we acknowledge your journey/effort to get here.\" In the TV-show example, this commonly means \"thank you for your effort to watch this particular show, out of all the ones you could have chosen.\"",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To differentiate between 「へ」 and 「に」, remember that 「へ」 focuses on the act of moving towards something, while 「に」 emphasizes the arrival or existence at a particular location. For instance, you might say 「学校へ行く」 (go towards school), but 「学校にいる」 (be at school). While both can be used for destination, 「へ」 highlights the process or journey, while 「に」 highlights the result or static location. 「に向かって・に向けて」 adds a stronger sense of deliberate orientation or facing towards a direction compared to 「へ」's more general indication of movement.",
