        "usage-context": "Used to indicate the destination or direction of movement, often with an emphasis on the journey or the act of moving rather than just the endpoint.",
        "function": "Marks the target or direction of verbs of motion (e.g., 行く, 来る, 帰る, 進む) and verbs of sending/giving (e.g., 送る, 出す, あげる).",
        "nuance": "Compared to に, へ places more emphasis on the path or the act of moving towards a destination, rather than simply the destination itself. It can also imply a sense of respect or acknowledgment of effort, particularly in expressions like ようこそ. It is also used metaphorically for actions directed toward a person or entity, such as sending a letter 'to' someone or directing a question 'to' someone, emphasizing the 'flow' of the action. This particle can be used by any gender or age and is appropriate across various registers, though its nuance of emphasizing a journey can lend it a slightly more formal or poetic feel in some contexts compared to に, which is often more neutral about the journey itself, simply stating the destination."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle へ originates from the verb 「経 (へ)」, meaning \"to pass through\" or \"to go via\". This etymology highlights the particle's core function of indicating direction and movement towards a destination.",
    "writeup": "へ is a particle used when describing a place that someone or something is moving toward or in contact with. In many cases, the particles に and へ are interchangeable, but there is a slight difference in nuance. へ focuses more on the distance/effort required to get between (A) and (B), while に focuses more on the connection between (A) and (B). へ always comes after the noun signifying the destination. While they may seem the same at first glance, へ shows that there is a space between (A) and (B), while に puts the emphasis solely on the destination. This is why common expressions such as 「city/country name へ ようこそ」 sound very polite. It is like saying, \"Welcome, and we acknowledge your journey/effort to get here.\" In the TV-show example, this commonly means \"thank you for your effort to watch this particular show, out of all the ones you could have chosen.\"",
