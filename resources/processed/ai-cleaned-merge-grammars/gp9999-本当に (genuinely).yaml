jlpt: N4
etymology: The word 「本当 (ほんとう)」 combines 「本 (ほん - origin, main)」 and 「当 (とう - hit, appropriate)」, signifying
  something that 'hits the main point' or is 'appropriate to the origin.' This evolved to mean 'truth'
  or 'reality.' The particle 「に」 transforms this noun into an adverb, giving it the meaning of 'truly,'
  'really,' or 'genuinely,' emphasizing the veracity or intensity of what is being expressed.
writeup: |-
  「本当に」 is a versatile adverb in Japanese used to convey a sense of truth, genuineness, or a high degree of something. It translates to 'really,' 'truly,' or 'genuinely' in English and can modify verbs, adjectives (both い-adjectives and な-adjectives), and occasionally other adverbs.

  When used with a verb or adjective, 「本当に」 emphasizes the sincerity or intensity of the action or state. For example, 「本当に疲れた」 means 'I am *really* tired,' highlighting the depth of one's fatigue. Similarly, 「本当にありがとう」 expresses a 'truly heartfelt thank you.'

  While 「本当に」 is generally used to affirm truth, it can also be employed in questions to seek genuine confirmation, as in 「本当にそう思いますか？」 ('Do you *really* think so?'), often implying a hint of disbelief or surprise on the speaker's part.

  Furthermore, in certain contexts, 「本当に」 can be used ironically or sarcastically. The nuance depends heavily on intonation and surrounding conversational elements, making it a flexible tool for expressing a wide range of speaker attitudes.

  Unlike some intensifiers that solely focus on degree (e.g., 「とても」 'very'), 「本当に」 carries a stronger implication of veracity or a deep, sincere feeling, making it suitable for situations where one wants to convey conviction.

  - term: まさか
    meaning: no way・you must be joking
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「まさか」 expresses strong disbelief or impossibility, often used when something is highly unexpected
      or unbelievable, standing in direct contrast to the strong affirmation of truth that 「本当に」 conveys.
      It challenges the reality of a situation rather than confirming it.
    grammar_point: まさか (no way)
  - term: 確かに
    meaning: certainly・indeed
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「確かに」 also conveys certainty, it often implies agreement with a previous statement or
      observation, or acknowledges something as a fact. 「本当に」, on the other hand, emphasizes the absolute
      truth, genuineness, or high degree of something, often from the speaker's personal conviction. 「確かに」
      can function as a discourse marker, acknowledging a point made by someone else, which 「本当に」 cannot.
    grammar_point: 確かに (certainly・indeed)
  - term: 実に
    meaning: truly・indeed
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「実に」 is a more formal or literary adverb compared to 「本当に」. It is often used to express strong
      admiration or to emphasize a profound or absolute truth, appearing less frequently in everyday conversation.
      While both mean 'truly,' 「実に」 often carries a more declarative, sometimes even exclamatory, tone,
      whereas 「本当に」 is more common for general emphasis of truth or sincerity.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:実に (truly・indeed)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing 「本当に」 from similar expressions, remember that 「本当に」 primarily
  affirms truth, sincerity, or intensity. In contrast, 「まさか」 negates belief, expressing disbelief or surprise.
  「確かに」 confirms something, often agreeing with a previous statement or acknowledging a fact, and can
  be used as a simple affirmative. 「実に」, while also meaning 'truly,' leans towards more formal or literary
  contexts, often conveying a strong, almost profound sense of truth or admiration.
