    "writeup": "「向かい」 (mukai) is a fundamental Japanese term used to describe a spatial relationship, specifically denoting a position that is directly opposite or facing something. It typically implies a relatively close distance and a clear, unobstructed line of sight. Think of it as 'across from' or 'facing'. It is commonly used for locations directly across a street, a building opposite yours, or a person sitting across the table.Key Usages:Direct Opposition: When something is directly in front of or facing another object or person.Proximity: Often used for relatively close distances where a direct line of sight is implied.Common Forms:Noun + の + 向かい: Describes a noun's location relative to another noun (e.g., 「駅の向かい」 - across from the station).Location + に + 向かい: Indicates where something is located (e.g., 「道の向かいに」 - across the street).Standalone: Can be used on its own when the context is clear (e.g., 「向かいに座る」 - to sit across).",
