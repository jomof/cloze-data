jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: General usage, often in informative or objective contexts
  function: To express general consensus or widely held beliefs, distancing the speaker's personal opinion.
  nuance: Presents information as objective or commonly accepted, implying that the speaker is reporting
    a shared understanding rather than asserting a personal viewpoint.
etymology: This grammar point is formed by combining the particle 「と」 (to), the verb 「考える」 (kangaeru -
  to think) in its passive form 「考えられる」 (kangaerareru - to be thought), and the auxiliary verb 「いる」 (iru)
  in its progressive form 「ている」 (teiru), followed by 「だ」 (da) or 「です」 (desu) to indicate assertion. The
  passive form shifts the focus away from the agent doing the thinking, emphasizing the widespread nature
  of the belief or opinion.
writeup: The grammar point 「とかんがえられている」 is used to express that something is widely considered or thought
  to be a certain way. It's often used to present commonly held opinions or beliefs, rather than personal
  opinions. The passive form 「考えられている」 emphasizes that the thought is not necessarily the speaker's own,
  but rather a general consensus. This construction is useful for presenting information objectively or
  highlighting popular beliefs. It can be used interchangeably with 「と思われている」.

  a widely accepted or established belief or consideration.

      analytical tone.

    register: casual
    setting: storytelling

      rather than a verifiable fact. The sentence has a gentle, reflective tone fitting for sharing folklore.

          point that describes a widely accepted piece of common wisdom.
