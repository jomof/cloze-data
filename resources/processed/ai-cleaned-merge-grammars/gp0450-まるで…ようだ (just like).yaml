details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: General use
  function: To express a strong, often exaggerated, comparison or resemblance.
  nuance: Emphasizes the completeness or intensity of the resemblance. Often used for dramatic effect
    or to convey a surprising similarity.
etymology: The word 「まるで」 means "completely" or "entirely". 「ようだ」 means "like" or "similar to". The combination
  creates the nuance of something seeming **exactly** like something else.
writeup: |-
  「まるで…ようだ」 is a powerful expression used to convey a strong, often exaggerated, comparison or resemblance. It combines the adverb 「まるで」 (meaning "entirely" or "completely," sometimes written as 「丸で」) with the auxiliary adjective 「ようだ」 (meaning "as if" or "as though"). This combination creates a sense of almost identical similarity.

  「まるで」 is placed at the beginning of the sentence or clause, preceding the description of what the subject seems to be like. The core nuance of "as if" or "as though" primarily comes from 「ようだ」 or its more casual counterpart, 「みたいだ」. 「まるで」 serves to intensify this comparison, emphasizing that the resemblance is **complete** or **total**.

  While 「まるで」 can independently mean "entirely" or "completely" in certain contexts (e.g., 「まるでだめだ」 - "It's completely useless"), when paired with 「ようだ」 or 「みたいだ」, its role is to amplify the comparative meaning. Therefore, the phrase 「まるで…ようだ」 is specifically used when the speaker wants to highlight an overwhelming or striking resemblance.

  - term: かのようだ
    meaning: As if, Just like
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「まるで…ようだ」 emphasizes a sense of complete or near-complete similarity, 「かのようだ」 simply
      indicates a likeness without necessarily implying the same degree of intensity. 「かのようだ」 often implies
      a hypothetical or imagined resemblance, whereas 「まるで…ようだ」 often implies a striking, perceived reality.
    grammar_point: かのようだ・かのように (as if)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「まるで」 adds a layer of "entirely" or "completely"
  to the comparison. If you want to express a strong, almost exaggerated similarity, 「まるで…ようだ」 is appropriate.
  If you simply want to indicate a resemblance, 「かのようだ」 may be a better choice.
examples:
  - english: Her singing voice is just like an angel singing.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 の 歌声 は、{まるで} 天使 が 歌っ て いる {よう だ}
      - 彼女 の 歌声 は、{まるで} 天使 が 歌っ て いる {よう です}
      - 彼女 の 歌声 は、{まるで} 天使 が 歌っ て いる {みたい だ}
      - 彼女 の 歌声 は、{まるで} 天使 が 歌っ て いる {みたい です}
    english_literally: Her singing voice, entirely as if an angel is singing.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 の 歌声 は、天使 が 歌っ て いる よう だ
        english: Her singing voice is like an angel singing.
        hint: The nuance of 'just like' or 'entirely as if' requires a specific adverb to emphasize the
          completeness of the comparison. We're looking for an intensifying word for 'as if'.
    scene: You are at a concert, captivated by a singer's performance.
    register: casual
    setting: creative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The use of 「まるで」 emphasizes the extraordinary nature of her singing voice, making the comparison
      to an angel complete and striking. The phrase 「天使が歌っているようだ」 (tenshi ga utatte iru you da) literally
      means 'it is like an angel is singing'.
    etymology: The concept of an 'angel' (天使) in this context evokes a sense of pure, celestial beauty,
      enhancing the strong comparison made with 「まるで」.
  - english: His room is just like a garbage dump.
    japanese:
      - 彼 の 部屋 は、{まるで} ゴミ 屋敷 の {よう だ}
      - 彼 の 部屋 は、{まるで} ゴミ 屋敷 の {よう です}
      - 彼 の 部屋 は、{まるで} ゴミ 屋敷 {みたい だ}
      - 彼 の 部屋 は、{まるで} ゴミ 屋敷 {みたい です}
    english_literally: His room, entirely as if a garbage mansion.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 部屋 は、ゴミ 屋敷 みたい だ
        english: His room is like a garbage dump.
        hint: To convey the strong, exaggerated sense of 'just like' or 'entirely as if', a particular
          intensifying adverb is needed before the comparison. We're looking for a word that emphasizes
          the completeness of the likeness.
    scene: You open the door to your friend's room and are shocked by the mess.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「まるで」 here conveys the speaker's extreme reaction and the overwhelming similarity to a garbage
      dump, emphasizing the complete mess. 「ゴミ屋敷」 (gomi yashiki) means 'garbage mansion'.
    etymology: 「ゴミ 屋敷」 literally means 'garbage mansion', a vivid, somewhat exaggerated term for a very
      messy place, which pairs well with the emphatic 「まるで」.
  - english: Outside is just like the inside of a refrigerator, it's so cold.
    japanese:
      - 外 は {まるで} 冷蔵 庫 の 中 の {よう に} 寒い
      - 外 は {まるで} 冷蔵 庫 の 中 の {みたい に} 寒い
    english_literally: Outside, entirely as if inside a refrigerator, is cold.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 外 は 冷蔵 庫 の 中 の よう に 寒い
        english: Outside is cold like the inside of a refrigerator.
        hint: This comparison indicates similarity, but the English 'just like' implies a stronger, more
          complete resemblance. You need an adverb to convey that intensity, especially for something
          as strikingly cold as a refrigerator.
    scene: You step outside on a winter day and are hit by an extreme chill.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: This sentence uses 「まるで…ように」 to modify the adjective 「寒い」 (samui, cold), indicating the **manner**
      or **degree** of coldness. 「まるで」 intensifies the comparison, stressing that the coldness is **completely**
      like that of a refrigerator. 「冷蔵庫」 (reizouko) is 'refrigerator'.
    etymology: 「冷蔵庫」 (reizouko) combines 「冷」 (rei, cold), 「蔵」 (zō, storehouse), and 「庫」 (ko, warehouse),
      literally a 'cold storage house'. This precise term for a refrigerator strengthens the analogy with
      the outside temperature.
  - english: This cake is just like a jewel, isn't it?
    japanese:
      - この ケーキ、{まるで} 宝石 {みたい} だ ね
      - この ケーキ、{まるで} 宝石 {みたい です} ね
      - この ケーキ、{まるで} 宝石 の {よう だ} ね
      - この ケーキ、{まるで} 宝石 の {よう です} ね
    english_literally: This cake, entirely as if a jewel, isn't it.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この ケーキ、宝石 みたい だ ね
        english: This cake is like a jewel, isn't it?
        hint: To convey the full impact of 'just like' or 'entirely as if', an intensifying adverb is
          necessary before the comparison, especially when describing such a dazzling appearance.
    scene: You are admiring a beautifully decorated cake at a pastry shop.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: Using 「みたいだ」 instead of 「ようだ」 makes the expression more casual and conversational, suitable
      for admiring something with a friend. 「まるで」 still adds emphasis to the dazzling appearance of the
      cake, as if it's completely a jewel. The final 「ね」 (ne) seeks agreement. 「宝石」 (houseki) means 'jewel'.
    etymology: 「宝石」 (houseki) means 'jewel' or 'gemstone', and its visual association with sparkle and
      preciousness makes it a strong comparison for something beautiful, amplified by 「まるで」.
  - english: To do something like that, it's just like a child!
    japanese:
      - そんな こと を する なんて、{まるで} 子供 {じゃ ない か}
      - そんな こと を する なんて、{まるで} 子供 {で は ない か}
      - そんな こと を する なんて、{まるで} 子供 {みたい じゃ ない か}
      - そんな こと を する なんて、{まるで} 子供 {みたい で は ない か}
      - そんな こと を する なんて、{まるで} 子供 {で は あり ませ ん か}
      - そんな こと を する なんて、{まるで} 子供 {みたい で は あり ませ ん か}
    english_literally: To do such a thing, entirely as if not a child? (rhetorical question)
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - そんな こと を する なんて、子供 みたい だ
        english: To do something like that, it's like a child.
        hint: The original sentence has a strong, almost exasperated tone conveying 'just like a child'.
          Consider what word emphasizes the completeness of this comparison and the speaker's frustration.
    scene: An older male colleague is scolding a younger team member for an immature mistake during a
      work project.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「まるで子供じゃないか」 by an older male implies a strong, almost exasperated criticism, typical
      of a more authoritative or paternal tone often heard from older men when admonishing someone younger.
      The rhetorical question 「じゃないか」 reinforces the speaker's judgment and expectation of agreement.
      「子供」 (kodomo) itself can be used dismissively here.
    etymology: 「子供」 (kodomo) combines 「子」 (ko, child) and 「供」 (tomo, companion/offer). In this context,
      it's used to denote immaturity, highlighting the complete childlike nature of the action with 「まるで」.
  - english: He suddenly disappeared. It was just as if he vanished like smoke.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 突然 姿 を 消し た。{まるで} 煙 の {よう に} 消え去っ た
      - 彼 は 突然 姿 を 消し た。{まるで} 煙 の {みたい に} 消え去っ た
    english_literally: He suddenly disappeared. Entirely as if smoke, he vanished.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 突然 姿 を 消し た。煙 の よう に 消え去っ た
        english: He vanished like smoke.
        hint: The English 'just as if' suggests a complete, emphatic comparison. Think about what adverb
          adds that strong sense of an almost supernatural disappearance.
    scene: You are recounting a mysterious event where someone vanished without a trace.
    register: formal
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: In a storytelling context, 「まるで」 enhances the dramatic effect, emphasizing the complete and
      almost supernatural nature of the disappearance. The phrase 「煙のように」 (kemuri no you ni) is a common
      simile, and 「まるで」 adds a layer of absolute resemblance. 「消え去った」 (kiesatta) means 'vanished'.
    etymology: The verb 「消え去る」 (kie saru) is a compound verb meaning 'to vanish completely' or 'to disappear
      without a trace'. It combines 「消える」 (kieru, to disappear) and 「去る」 (saru, to leave/go away), further
      intensifying the sense of complete disappearance, perfectly matched by 「まるで」.
  - english: She is sitting quietly, just like a doll.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は {まるで} 人形 の {よう に} 静か に 座っ て いる
      - 彼女 は {まるで} 人形 の {みたい に} 静か に 座っ て いる
    english_literally: She, entirely as if a doll, is sitting quietly.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 人形 の よう に 静か に 座っ て いる
        english: She is sitting quietly like a doll.
        hint: To convey the strong, 'just like' resemblance, emphasizing the complete similarity, you
          need an intensifying adverb at the beginning of the comparison. Consider the word that makes
          the comparison absolute.
    scene: You observe someone who is unusually still and quiet.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: Here, 「まるで」 highlights the striking and almost unsettling stillness of the person, comparing
      it completely to a doll. The phrase 「人形のように」 (ningyō no you ni) is used as an adverbial phrase modifying
      「静かに座っている」 (shizuka ni suwatte iru, sitting quietly). 「人形」 (ningyō) means 'doll'.
    etymology: 「人形」 (ningyō) means 'doll' or 'puppet'. The static, often expressionless nature of a doll
      makes it a suitable object for comparison when describing extreme stillness, reinforced by 「まるで」.
  - english: He looks just like he's about to cry.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は {まるで} 泣き 出し そう な {よう だ}
      - 彼 は {まるで} 泣き 出し そう な {よう です}
      - 彼 は {まるで} 泣き 出し そう な {みたい だ}
      - 彼 は {まるで} 泣き 出し そう な {みたい です}
    english_literally: He, entirely as if he is about to cry, seems.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 泣き 出し そう だ
        english: He looks like he's about to cry.
        hint: This simply states he looks like he's about to cry. The original sentence emphasizes the
          complete resemblance to that state, requiring the intensifying adverb that makes it an absolute
          visual.
    scene: You see a child or someone on the verge of tears.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The expression 「泣き出しそう」 (nakidashisou) means 'looks like he's about to cry'. Adding 「まるで」
      intensifies this appearance, suggesting an almost perfect resemblance to someone on the verge of
      tears. This usage of 「まるで」 emphasizes the striking reality of the situation.
    etymology: 「泣き出す」 (nakidasu) combines 「泣く」 (naku, to cry) and 「出す」 (dasu, to start), meaning 'to start
      crying'. The suffix 「そう」 (sou) indicates 'seems like' or 'looks like', and the combination creates
      a vivid image that is then amplified by 「まるで」.
  - english: That shocking news was just as if it were a lie.
    japanese:
      - あの 衝撃 的 な ニュース は {まるで} 嘘 の {よう だっ た}
      - あの 衝撃 的 な ニュース は {まるで} 嘘 の {よう でし た}
      - あの 衝撃 的 な ニュース は {まるで} 嘘 {みたい だっ た}
      - あの 衝撃 的 な ニュース は {まるで} 嘘 {みたい でし た}
    english_literally: That shocking news, entirely as if a lie, was.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 衝撃 的 な ニュース は 嘘 だっ た よう だ
        english: That shocking news seems to have been a lie.
        hint: The original sentence makes a strong comparison about how the news *was*, not just how it
          *seems* now. The original implies a very striking resemblance to a lie, needing an intensifying
          adverb.
    scene: You are reflecting on a past event that seemed too unbelievable to be true.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: The past tense 「ようだった」 emphasizes that the news *was* entirely like a lie, underscoring the
      strong disbelief or unreality of the event. 「衝撃的」 (shōgeki-teki) means 'shocking', and 「嘘」 (uso)
      means 'lie'. The combination with 「まるで」 stresses the complete nature of this comparison.
    etymology: 「衝撃」 (shōgeki) means 'shock' or 'impact', and adding 「的」 (teki) turns it into an adjective
      meaning 'shocking'. This phrase, 「衝撃的なニュース」 (shōgeki-teki na nyūsu), sets up a context where the
      following comparison with 「まるで」 gains significant weight due to the inherent incredibility.
  - english: Even after being scolded, she acted just as if nothing had happened.
    japanese:
      - 叱ら れ て も、彼女 は {まるで} 何 も なかっ た {よう に} 振る舞っ た
      - 叱ら れ て も、彼女 は {まるで} 何 も なかっ た {みたい に} 振る舞っ た
    english_literally: Even being scolded, she, entirely as if nothing had happened, behaved.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 叱ら れ て も、彼女 は 何 も なかっ た か の よう に 振る舞っ た
        english: Even after being scolded, she acted as if nothing had happened.
        hint: This implies a likeness, but the original sentence emphasizes the *complete* and striking
          nature of her composure. Look for the adverb that adds this intense nuance, showing an absolute
          lack of visible reaction.
    scene: Describing someone's surprisingly calm reaction to a negative event.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: Here, 「まるで」 intensifies the surprising composure, making the phrase 「何もなかったように」 (nani mo nakatta
      you ni, as if nothing had happened) mean 'entirely as if nothing had happened'. This highlights
      the complete lack of visible reaction despite being scolded.
    etymology: 「叱る」 (shikaru) means 'to scold', and the passive form 「叱られる」 (shikarareru) means 'to be
      scolded'. The phrase 「何もなかったように」 is a common expression for appearing unaffected, and 「まるで」 elevates
      this to an astonishing degree of detachment.
  - english: The situation was so peculiar, it was just as if it were strange.
    japanese:
      - その 状況 は {まるで} 奇妙 な {よう だっ た}
      - その 状況 は {まるで} 奇妙 な {よう でし た}
      - その 状況 は {まるで} 奇妙 {みたい だっ た}
      - その 状況 は {まるで} 奇妙 {みたい でし た}
    english_literally: That situation, entirely as if strange, was.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 状況 は 奇妙 だっ た
        english: The situation was strange.
        hint: This simply states the situation was strange. The original emphasizes that it was *just
          as if* it were strange, highlighting an intense and perhaps surprising peculiarity, needing
          an intensifying adverb.
    scene: Discussing a puzzling or unsettling situation.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: The use of 「まるで」 with 「奇妙なようだ」 (kimyō na you da) intensifies the perception of strangeness,
      implying that the situation completely and unequivocally presented itself as peculiar. 「奇妙な」 (kimyō
      na) is a な-adjective meaning "peculiar" or "strange".
    etymology: 「奇妙」 (kimyō) means 'peculiar' or 'strange'. When combined with 「まるで...ようだ」, it expresses
      a strong sense that something is completely and surprisingly peculiar, emphasizing the subjective
      perception of its strangeness.
post_example_writeup: 'When using 「まるで…ようだ」, pay close attention to the form preceding 「ようだ」 or 「みたいだ」.
  It follows the same rules as 「ようだ」 itself: plain form for verbs and い-adjectives, な-adjective stem +
  な, and noun + の. The 「まるで」 always precedes this structure to provide the emphatic ''entirely'' or ''just
  as though'' nuance. When modifying a verb or adjective, the adverbial forms 「まるで…ように」 or 「まるで…みたいに」
  are used.'
