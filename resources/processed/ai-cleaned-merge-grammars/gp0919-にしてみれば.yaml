This is what it would be like *if I were* in that situation.

    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from 「に」 (case-marking particle), 「する」 (to do) in its て-form 「して」, and 「見る」 (to see) in its conditional ば-form 「見れば」. Literally, it means \"assuming that I were (A) and then looking from that perspective.\"",
    "writeup": "「にしてみれば」, usually written entirely in hiragana, is used to express a hypothetical statement from someone else's point of view. It often translates to \"from the point of view of (A), (B),\" \"in the case of (A), (B),\" or simply \"for (A), (B).\" The literal meaning is akin to \"assuming I were (A) and looking from there, (B).\"\n\n「にしてみれば」 follows nouns representing people or organizations that represent people. The (B) part of the phrase typically discusses how the speaker assumes the person or group would feel in a given situation. Consequently, sentences often conclude with 「だろう」, 「でしょう」, 「かもしれない」, or similar expressions, indicating speculation or uncertainty.\n\nThis expression is typically used in a formal or semi-formal register, though it can appear in casual conversation depending on context. It indicates that the speaker is empathizing with or trying to understand the subjective internal experience of the person or group in question.",

They imply judging a situation from a given standpoint. 「にしてみれば」 focuses on the *internal experience* or subjective feeling of being in that person's situation, as if one is experiencing it themselves."

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「にとって」 and 「から見れば/からすると」 can sometimes be used similarly, the key difference lies in the nuance of perspective. 「にしてみれば」 implies an empathetic attempt to understand the internal reality or feelings of the person/group, as if you are stepping into their shoes. 「にとって」 merely states relevance to that person without this deeper internal consideration, and 「から見れば/からすると」 denotes an observation or judgment made from a specific external standpoint. Choose 「にしてみれば」 when you want to highlight that the statement reflects what someone would genuinely feel, think, or experience if they were that person.",
