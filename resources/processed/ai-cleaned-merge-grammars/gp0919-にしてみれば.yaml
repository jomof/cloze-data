    "writeup": "「にしてみれば」, usually written completely in hiragana, is an expression used when the speaker is making a hypothetical statement about how something may appear from the point of view of another. It will often be translated as \"from the point of view of (A), (B)\", \"in the case of (A), (B)\", or simply \"for (A), (B)\". Literally, the meaning is \"assuming that I was (A) and then looking from there, (B)\". 「にしてみれば」 will appear after nouns that represent a person, or organizations representative of people. It is a combination of the case-marking particle 「に」, the て-form of 「する」, and the hypothetical form of 「見る」, 「見れば」. As 「にしてみれば」 will exclusively follow words that indicate a person or a group of people, the (B) part of the phrase will usually discuss how the speaker assumes that they would feel given the situation. Because of this assumption, these sentences often finish with 「だろう」, 「でしょう」, 「かもしれない」, and other similar structures.",
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にしてみれば」 is derived from: 「に」 (case marking particle indicating direction or purpose) + 「して」 (te-form of 「する」, 'to do') + 「みれば」 (hypothetical form of 「見る」, 'to see'). Therefore, it literally means 'if you try to see it from the perspective of'.",
