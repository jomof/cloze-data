        "part-of-speech": "phrase",

        "usage-context": "Used to express a subjective viewpoint from someone else's perspective, often implying empathy or a deep consideration of their circumstances.",
        "function": "Indicates the viewpoint or perspective of the preceding noun.",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes that the following statement is what one might think, feel, or experience if one were in the shoes of the preceding noun. It implies a deeper consideration of their internal state or unique situation, often contrasting with other perspectives.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as an adverbial phrase modifying the main clause.",
        "temporal-flow": "Present or general truth about a perspective.",
        "spatial-flow": "Metaphorically shifts the perspective to 'inside' another's mind or situation. A speaker adopts another person's position or context. This is what it would be like *if I were* in that situation. This is subtly different from 「にとって」, which means 'for' or 'from the standpoint of' without implying this deeper, 'stepping into their shoes' nuance. 「から見れば」/「からすると」 refer to how something appears from an external perspective."
    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from 「に」 (case-marking particle), 「する」 (to do) in its て-form 「して」, and 「見る」 (to see) in its conditional ば-form 「見れば」. Literally, it means \"assuming that I were (A) and then looking from that perspective.\"",
    "writeup": "「にしてみれば」, usually written entirely in hiragana, is used to express a hypothetical statement from someone else's point of view. It often translates to \"from the point of view of (A), (B),\" \"in the case of (A), (B),\" or simply \"for (A), (B).\" The literal meaning is akin to \"assuming I were (A) and looking from there, (B).\"\n\n「にしてみれば」 follows nouns representing people or organizations that represent people. The (B) part of the phrase typically discusses how the speaker assumes the person or group would feel in a given situation. Consequently, sentences often conclude with 「だろう」, 「でしょう」, 「かもしれない」, or similar expressions, indicating speculation or uncertainty.\n\nThis expression is typically used in a formal or semi-formal register, though it can appear in casual conversation depending on context. It indicates that the speaker is empathizing with or trying to understand the subjective internal experience of the person or group in question.",
