jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used in official announcements, written reports, news articles, and formal correspondence
    to convey information received from others or from circumstances. It often implies a degree of objectivity
    or detachment from the reported content.
  function: To relay information that has been heard, communicated, or understood, framing it as a fact
    or circumstance rather than a personal observation or opinion.
  nuance: Conveys reported information in a concise, formal, and sometimes slightly archaic manner. It
    suggests that the preceding statement is the 'reason' or 'circumstance' of something, as it has been
    conveyed or established. It's less about the speaker's direct perception and more about the information's
    source or status.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a fixed expression or nominal phrase that concludes a clause, turning
    it into a reported fact or circumstance.
  logical-flow: Presents a conclusion or fact based on prior information or circumstances.
  temporal-flow: Refers to information that has already been communicated or established.
  spatial-flow: Not directly applicable, but the information being conveyed can relate to spatial circumstances.
etymology: The term 「由 (yoshi)」 originates from the noun 「由 (yoshi)」, meaning "reason," "cause," "circumstance,"
  or "history." Its grammatical use to convey reported information stems from the idea of presenting "the
  reason" or "the circumstances" of a situation as they have been communicated or understood. This makes
  it a formal and somewhat older expression for relaying facts, emphasizing the underlying account or
  background of the report.
writeup: |-
  The expression 「由 (よし)」 is used to convey information that has been received or heard, typically in formal or official contexts. It functions to relay facts or circumstances based on what has been communicated to the speaker or is understood to be the case, rather than expressing the speaker's direct observation or personal opinion.

  This makes 「由 (よし)」 particularly suitable for written announcements, legal documents, and formal reports, where an objective and concise tone is desired. It can be thought of as akin to phrases like "it is understood that," "it is said that," or "the circumstances are that" in English.

  While often standing alone after a plain form statement, 「由 (よし)」 can also be followed by copulas such as 「だ」, 「である」, or 「とのことだ」 to explicitly reinforce its reported nature. Its use signals a degree of formality and can sometimes lend a slightly archaic feel to the communication, setting it apart from more contemporary reporting expressions.
false_friends:
  - term: 〜そうだ
    meaning: It is said that; I hear that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜そうだ」 is a common and less formal way to report hearsay or direct sensory observations. It
      can convey either 'I hear that...' (hearsay) or 'It looks like...' (visual inference). In contrast,
      「〜由 (よし)」 is exclusively for reported information, used in formal or written contexts, and carries
      a nuance of relaying established facts or circumstances.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Sentence]そうだ (I heard・it is said)
  - term: 〜らしい
    meaning: It seems that; I hear that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜らしい」 implies an inference or general impression based on indirect evidence, rumors, or what
      one has heard, often with a sense of typicality. It can convey uncertainty. 「〜由 (よし)」, however,
      is a formal and neutral statement of reported facts or circumstances, implying a more direct transmission
      of information rather than an inference.
    grammar_point: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)'
  - term: 〜といわれている
    meaning: It is said that; It is commonly said that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜といわれている」 indicates widespread belief or common knowledge. It suggests that something is
      generally accepted or a common rumor. While formal, its focus is on general consensus rather than
      a specific reported 'circumstance' as conveyed by 「〜由 (よし)」, which is more suited for official or
      specific factual reports.
    grammar_point: といわれている (it is said that)
  - term: 〜とされている
    meaning: It is considered to be; It is regarded as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜とされている」 suggests that something is officially or commonly accepted as true, often based
      on formal decisions or general recognition. It's about how something is 'regarded.' 「〜由 (よし)」 merely
      reports what the circumstances are or what has been stated, without necessarily implying a judgment
      or widespread acceptance of the information itself.
    grammar_point: とされている (is considered)
  - term: 〜によると・〜によれば
    meaning: According to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜によると」 and 「〜によれば」 explicitly specify the source of information. While 「〜由 (よし)」 also implies
      information from a source, it emphasizes the *nature* of the information as a reported circumstance,
      rather than directly naming the source. 「〜由 (よし)」 can be used independently after a plain form statement,
      whereas 「〜によると」 always requires a source before it.
    grammar_point: によると・によれば (according to)
post_false_friends_writeup: While all these expressions convey reported information, the key distinction
  for 「由 (よし)」 lies in its formality and its focus on presenting information as established 'circumstances'
  or 'reasons' from a source, often in official or written contexts. Unlike more common reporting forms
  like 「〜そうだ」 or 「〜らしい」, 「由 (よし)」 maintains a higher degree of objectivity and is less about personal
  inference or widespread rumor. 「〜によると」 specifies the source, but 「〜由 (よし)」 often implies a source without
  stating it directly, emphasizing the *fact* of the report.
