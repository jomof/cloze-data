    "etymology": "The term 「それも」 is formed from 「それ」 (sore), meaning \"that,\" and the particle 「も」 (mo), meaning \"also\" or \"even.\"  Literally, it conveys the idea of \"that, too,\" or \"even that.\" Over time, its usage evolved from a simple additive function to emphasize an additional piece of information that is often unexpected, more specific, or intensifies the preceding statement, whether positively or negatively. It signifies a point that is 'on top of' or 'in addition to' what was just mentioned, often adding weight to the second element.",
    "writeup": "The conjunction 「それも」 serves to add further details or emphasize a point already made. It characteristically introduces information that is often unexpected, negative, or particularly noteworthy, thereby adding weight to the initial statement. It can be translated as \"what's more,\" \"and moreover,\" \"on top of that,\" or \"and at that.\"\n\nWhile it shares some similarity with 「しかも」, 「それも」 often carries a stronger nuance of introducing something surprising, aggravating, or a particularly salient detail. It functions to specify or elaborate on the preceding statement, often highlighting a crucial aspect or consequence that might be unexpected or undesirable. The nuance can range from simply adding specific information to expressing surprise, frustration, or admiration. For example, it can emphasize a positive aspect that makes something even better, or a negative aspect that makes a situation even worse.\n\n 「それも」 typically connects clauses or phrases, drawing attention to a specific element within the context established by the first part of the sentence. It is a versatile expression used in various registers, from casual conversation to more formal writing, depending on the overall tone and context.",

            "nuance": "「おまけに」 often introduces an additional, often negative, point that 'adds to the burden' or 'makes matters worse', sometimes with a stronger sense of piling on or a more colloquial feel than 「それも」. It can also mean 'as a bonus' in a positive sense, but less commonly with this grammar point."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「それも」, 「しかも」, and 「おまけに」 can all be used to add information, paying close attention to their nuances is crucial. 「それも」 typically highlights a specific, often unexpected, or intensifying detail. 「しかも」 is a more neutral additive, simply stating an additional fact. 「おまけに」 often suggests an extra negative factor, making a situation worse, or occasionally a positive bonus.",
