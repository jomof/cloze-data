        "Register": "Can be used in various registers depending on the context, but often appears in informal conversation or writing."
    },
    "etymology": "「それ」 refers to \"that,\" and 「も」 means \"also\" or \"too.\" So, literally, 「それも」 means \"that too.\" It's used to add an additional piece of information, often something unexpected or reinforcing the previous point.",
    "writeup": "The conjunction 「それも」 is used to add further details or emphasize a point already made. It often introduces something unexpected, negative, or particularly noteworthy, adding weight to the initial statement. It can be translated as \"what's more,\" \"and moreover,\" or \"on top of that.\" It is similar to 「しかも」, but 「それも」 often carries a stronger nuance of adding something unexpected or even undesirable. Note that 「それも」 connects phrases or clauses, highlighting a specific aspect or consequence. The nuance can range from simply adding information to expressing surprise or exasperation.",
