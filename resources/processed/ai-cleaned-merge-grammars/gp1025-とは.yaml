    "etymology": "とは is a combination of the particle と, indicating quotation or content, and the topic marker は. This combination emphasizes the preceding statement as something surprising or unexpected.",
    "writeup": "とは is used to express surprise, disbelief, or unexpectedness about a situation or fact. It often appears at the end of a sentence and implies a strong emotional reaction without explicitly stating it. It is similar to saying \"I can't believe that...\" or \"Who knew that...?\" in English. The degree of emotion can range from mild surprise to strong disbelief.",

            "listener_gender": "male",
            "nuance": "The use of 「ねぇ」 (nee) at the end, while usable by anyone, slightly enhances the feminine and shared surprise in this casual context. This is also a typical expression when sharing a surprising discovery, and is directed here towards a male listener.",
            "etymology": "キアヌ・リーブス is written in katakana because it's a foreign name (Keanu Reeves)."

The use of 「まさか」 (masaka) followed by 「とは」 in this exclamatory tone is a common way for male speakers to express strong, self-directed surprise or amazement, often when talking to themselves or expressing an internal thought.",
