    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とは」 is a compound expression formed from the case-marking particle 「と」, typically used for quotation or specifying content, and the topic marker 「は」. In this construction, 「と」 marks the preceding statement or clause as the content of an implicit thought or feeling, and 「は」 then highlights this entire marked content as the topic of discussion, thereby emphasizing its unexpected or surprising nature. Historically, this structure evolved to focus the listener's attention on the unexpectedness of the information being presented, often leading to an implied emotional reaction from the speaker.",
    "writeup": "「とは」 is a versatile and emphatic grammatical structure used to convey a strong sense of surprise, disbelief, unexpectedness, or even disappointment regarding a preceding statement or situation. It typically appears at the end of a clause or sentence, implying a significant emotional reaction from the speaker without explicitly stating what that exact feeling is.\n\nIn English, it often translates similarly to phrases like 'To think that...', 'I can't believe that...', 'Who would have thought that...', or '(It's surprising) that...'. The specific emotion is inferred from context or may be explicitly stated immediately after the 「とは」 clause.\n\n**Key Nuances:**\n*   **Emphasis on Unexpectedness**: The primary function of 「とは」 is to highlight that the preceding information goes against the speaker's expectations, causing a strong internal reaction.\n*   **Implied Emotion**: While the exact emotion isn't stated by 「とは」 itself, it always signals an emotional impact. It can range from mild surprise to deep shock, joy, or regret.\n*   **Sentence-final usage**: It often concludes a thought, leaving the emotional weight of the unexpected revelation to linger. However, it can also be followed by an explicit statement of emotion (e.g., 「とは驚いた」 - \"I was surprised that...\").\n*   **Colloquial usage**: In casual conversation, it often appears with other exclamatory particles like 「ね」 or 「よ」 to soften or emphasize the reaction.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\nAlthough 「とは」 is a powerful tool for expressing surprise, it is generally considered standard usage. It does not carry specific gender or age connotations in its base form, making it widely applicable across different demographics and registers.",

            "kind": "similar expression",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「とは」, 「と言うのは」, and 「ことに」 might all involve some form of commentary on a preceding statement, it is crucial to distinguish their nuances. 「とは」 expresses a direct, often emotional, reaction to something unexpected or surprising. 「と言うのは」, on the other hand, introduces an explanation or definition. Lastly, 「ことに」 serves as an adverbial phrase expressing the speaker's surprise about the content of the following statement, often leading to a more objective observation rather than a strong personal exclamation.",
