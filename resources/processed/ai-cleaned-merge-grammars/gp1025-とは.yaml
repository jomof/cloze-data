    "etymology": "とは is a combination of the particle と, indicating content or quotation, and the particle は, which marks the topic. It highlights the preceding statement as something surprising or unexpected.",
    "writeup": "とは is an emphatic structure typically found at the end of sentences. It conveys that the speaker finds the preceding statement shocking, appalling, or unexpected. It's similar to saying \"to think that (A)\" in English, expressing a strong emotional response without explicitly stating it.\n\nとは combines the case-marking particle と in its \"quotation\" use with the adverbial particle は. This marks the entire statement as the topic being highlighted.\n\nIt can follow words like など, implying that \"something like (A)\" is surprising. Although the feeling is often unstated, the speaker may express their reaction explicitly afterwards.\n",
