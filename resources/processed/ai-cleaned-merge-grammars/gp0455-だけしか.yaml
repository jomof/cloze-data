    "etymology": "「だけ」 means \"only\" or \"just,\" emphasizing a singular item or condition. 「しか」 also means \"only\" or \"nothing but\" and requires a negative verb in the sentence. The combination of 「だけ」 and 「しか」 amplifies the sense of exclusivity, creating a stronger emphasis on \"only\".",
    "writeup": "「だけしか」 emphasizes that something is the **only** thing that satisfies a certain condition. It combines the nuances of 「だけ」 (just this) and 「しか」 (and *only* this!), creating a stronger sense of exclusivity.\n\n*   **Important Note:** 「だけしか」 **must** be followed by a negative verb (e.g., 「～ない」). The combination intensifies the meaning of \"only\".",
