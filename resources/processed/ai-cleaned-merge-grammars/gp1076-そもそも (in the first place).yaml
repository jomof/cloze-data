writeup: |-
  「そもそも」 is a powerful adverb used to return to the fundamental aspect or origin of a situation or statement. It conveys the sense of "in the first place," "to begin with," or "fundamentally." When used, it often signals the speaker's intent to question the very basis of an argument, an event, or a concept. This usage is common in discussions, debates, or when clarifying a complex issue by tracing it back to its core.

  The form 「そもそもの」 functions as a pre-noun adjectival, directly modifying a noun to emphasize its original or foundational nature. For instance, 「そもそもの原因」 (the original cause) highlights the root of a problem, suggesting that the initial condition or decision was the source. This distinction is crucial: 「そもそも」 (as an adverb) leads a clause or sentence, challenging or introducing a foundational point, while 「そもそもの」 (as an adjectival) directly qualifies a noun, pinpointing its primary or earliest state.

  This grammar point is frequently encountered in formal or argumentative discourse, academic writing, and situations where a speaker wishes to cut through superficialities and address the absolute core of a matter. It is a mature expression that demands clarity and precision, reflecting a speaker's desire to get to the bottom of things.
false_friends:
  - term: 元々
    meaning: Originally; by nature; from the start
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both can mean 'originally,' 「元々」 often refers to something's inherent nature or a state
      from the beginning, whereas 「そもそも」 questions the very basis or reason, or refers to the absolute
      origin.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:元々 (originally)
  - term: 第一
    meaning: First; foremost; primary
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「第一」 emphasizes the order or importance of something, like 'first of all,' or its primary
      status, while 「そもそも」 focuses on the foundational aspect or a deeper, originating reason behind something.
    grammar_point: 第一 (foremost・primary)
  - term: 最初
    meaning: Beginning; first (in chronological order)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「最初」 refers to the chronological first event or point in time. 「そもそも」 questions the fundamental
      premise or returns to the absolute origin, not just the temporal beginning.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:最初 (beginning)
  - term: 一体
    meaning: What in the world; how on earth (used to emphasize a question)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「一体」 is an intensifier for interrogative words, expressing bewilderment or strong questioning.
      While 「そもそも」 also questions, it specifically challenges the fundamental basis or origin, whereas
      「一体」 can emphasize any question.
    grammar_point: 一体 (emphasis in questions)
  - term: 根本的に
    meaning: Fundamentally; essentially; at the root
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「根本的に」 describes something being at its core or foundation. While related, 「そもそも」 is typically
      used as an adverb to bring up a fundamental question or to return to the origin of a discussion,
      whereas 「根本的に」 is an adverb describing the nature of something.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:根本的に (fundamentally)
  - term: 当初
    meaning: At first; at the outset; originally
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「当初」 refers to a point in time, specifically "at the beginning of a period or project". 「そもそも」
      is broader, referring to the fundamental reason or origin, not strictly chronological or project-based.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:当初 (at first)
  - term: 発端
    meaning: Origin; outset; source; start
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「発端」 is a noun referring to the specific starting point or cause of an event. While 「そもそもの」
      can modify it (e.g., 「そもそもの発端」), 「そもそも」 as an adverb questions the fundamental basis or reason,
      which is different from simply stating an origin.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:発端 (origin・outset)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing 「そもそも」 with similar expressions like 「元々」, 「第一」, 「最初」,
  「一体」, 「根本的に」, 「当初」, or 「発端」, remember that 「そもそも」 is used to question the underlying assumptions or
  introduce a fundamental point. 「元々」 describes an original state or inherent quality, 「第一」 emphasizes
  the order or priority of something, 「最初」 indicates a chronological beginning, and 「一体」 intensifies a
  question, often expressing bewilderment. 「根本的に」 is an adverb describing the nature of something at its
  core. 「当初」 refers to a specific chronological beginning of a period or project. 「発端」 is a noun referring
  to a specific initial cause or starting point.

        english: From the very beginning, this plan is not realistic.
        hint: 「最初から」 emphasizes a chronological starting point. We're looking for an expression that challenges
          the fundamental premise of the plan itself.
    scene: A seasoned manager expressing fundamental doubt about a new proposal's feasibility.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: This example uses 「そもそも」 to challenge the fundamental premise of the plan itself, indicating
      that its very foundation is flawed. The speaker, a seasoned manager, uses a formal tone appropriate
      for discussing a serious business matter with a group.
    etymology: The use of 「そもそも」 here connects to its original meaning of 'at the very origin' or 'that
      thing itself,' signifying that the problem lies at the core conceptualization of the plan.
  - english: The very origin of the pandemic was an infection in a small village.
    japanese:

          - パンデミック の 最初 の 発端 は、小さな 村 で の 感染 だっ た。
        english: The pandemic's first origin was an infection in a small village.
        hint: 「最初の」 refers to the first chronological event. We're looking for an expression that emphasizes
          the absolute, fundamental origin, implying the very root cause.
    scene: A historian tracing the beginning of a global health crisis to its earliest point.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: The phrase 「そもそもの発端」 highlights the absolute, foundational beginning of the pandemic, emphasizing
      that this specific infection was the ultimate root cause. This is common in academic or analytical
      contexts.
    etymology: 「発端」 means 'origin' or 'outset,' and combining it with 「そもそもの」 reinforces the idea of tracing
      back to the earliest and most fundamental point, aligning with 「そもそも」's etymological connection
      to 'the thing itself' from which everything else sprang.

    listener_gender: female

      out a basic lack of experience. The use of 「なの？」 and 「でしょ」 adds a sense of casual assertion and
      disbelief, common in casual female speech.
    etymology: The question 「なんで」 (why) preceding 「そもそも」 reinforces the act of challenging the core reason.
      The combined effect is to return to the fundamental validity of the decision, aligning with the
      questioning nature of 「そもそも」.
  - english: Why was he chosen? In the first place, he has no experience, right?

      questioning nature of 「そもそも」.

        english: Trusting you was the first mistake.

          the foundational error that led to everything else.

      was the core error.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The male speaker uses 「そもそもの間違い」 to convey that the fundamental error in their relationship
      started with trusting the listener. The ending 「んだよ」 adds a strong, assertive, and slightly accusatory
      tone common in casual male speech when expressing frustration or blame. Using 「お前」 (you) makes the
      statement more direct and informal, typically used among close male friends or when expressing anger.
    etymology: 「そもそもの間違い」 signifies the absolute, foundational error that set off a chain of negative
      events. This illustrates how 「そもそもの」 can be used to pinpoint the ultimate origin of a problem or
      regret.
  - english: Excuse me, but in the first place, is this data correct?

        english: Excuse me, but what in the world is this data correct?
        hint: 「一体」 intensifies a question, expressing bewilderment. We're looking for an expression that
          challenges the fundamental validity or basis of the data.
    scene: A junior analyst politely but firmly questioning the integrity of foundational data during
      a meeting.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The speaker uses 「恐縮ですが」 to maintain politeness while using 「そもそも」 to challenge the fundamental
      integrity of the data. The polite interrogative 「のでしょうか」 makes the question firm yet respectful,
      appropriate in a professional setting where a junior might question a senior.
    etymology: This usage emphasizes returning to the core premise of the discussion—the data's accuracy—before
      proceeding. It challenges the foundational assumption, which is at the heart of 「そもそも」.

          introduces a fundamental, foundational philosophical inquiry.
    scene: A philosopher pondering the fundamental question of human existence.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「そもそも」 introduces a profound, fundamental question about existence that probes the ultimate
      reason or origin. This usage is common in philosophical or reflective contexts, aiming to get to
      the absolute core of a matter. The more literary 「知る者はいない」 adds to the reflective tone.
    etymology: This example highlights 「そもそも」's role in initiating a deep inquiry into the fundamental
      nature or origin of something, extending its meaning beyond mere chronology to existential foundations.

          points to the absolute, originating cause of the confusion.

    setting: persuasive
    nuance: The speaker uses 「そもそもの根源」 to pinpoint the ultimate, foundational source of the problem, indicating
      that all subsequent issues stem from this one core flaw. The addition of 「こそ」 further emphasizes
      this point, making the statement more persuasive.
    etymology: 「根源」 (root/source) combined with 「そもそもの」 strongly emphasizes the fundamental, original
      cause, reinforcing the core meaning of 「そもそも」 as the absolute beginning or basis.
  - english: Was this kind of service even necessary in the first place?
    japanese:
      - こんな サービス、{そもそも} 必要 だっ た の？

          the fundamental necessity or justification for the service's existence.
    scene: A young woman expressing mild annoyance at an overly complicated or useless new service.
    register: casual
    setting: casual slang
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The female speaker uses 「そもそも」 to question the fundamental necessity of the service, implying
      "Why did we even consider this in the first place?" The rising intonation of 「必要だったの？」 adds a light,
      questioning, and slightly exasperated tone common in casual female speech when expressing mild frustration
      or doubt. Using 「要る？」 or 「かな？」 further softens and casualizes the question, typical for a female
      speaker to use when talking to herself or in a very informal setting.
    etymology: This casual use of 「そもそも」 still retains its core meaning of questioning the foundational
      premise, even in an informal context of mild exasperation.
  - english: In the first place, was it even possible to achieve that goal within a day?
    japanese:
      - '{そもそも} その 目標 を 一 日 で 達成 する こと は 可能 だっ た の か？'

          - 最初 から その 目標 を 一 日 で 達成 する こと は 可能 だっ た の か？
        english: From the very beginning, was it even possible to achieve that goal within a day?
        hint: 「最初から」 focuses on the very beginning of a timeline. We're looking for an expression that
          questions the fundamental feasibility of the goal itself, regardless of when it started.
    scene: A team meeting reviewing a past project that failed to meet its ambitious deadline, with a
      team member questioning the initial scope.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: This example uses 「そもそも」 to challenge the initial, fundamental assumption that the goal was
      achievable within the given timeframe, suggesting that the problem lay with the premise from the
      outset. This highlights a critical assessment of foundational planning.
    etymology: The phrase questions the inherent possibility of the task, tying into the core meaning
      of 「そもそも」 as a return to the absolute origin or fundamental nature of something, in this case, the
      goal's attainability.
  - english: Wait a minute, in the first place, I never said I would go, did I?

      - ちょっと 待っ て、{そもそも} 行く なんて 一言 も 言っ て ない から！
    english_literally: A little wait, in the first place, I going that said not, right?

        english: Wait a minute, actually, I never said I would go, did I?
        hint: 「実際に」 refers to what happened in reality or fact. We're looking for an expression that challenges
          the fundamental assumption made by the listener about an agreement or statement, going back
          to the absolute beginning of the conversation.
    scene: A discussion between friends where one friend is being accused of agreeing to something they
      never did, and is now clarifying the misunderstanding.
    register: casual
    setting: negotiating
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「そもそも」 here functions as a strong corrective, taking the conversation back to the
      absolute initial point of agreement or disagreement to highlight a fundamental misunderstanding.
      For the female speaker, 「～よ根？」 softens the assertion slightly while still making a clear point.
    etymology: This example showcases 「そもそも」 being used to revert to the earliest point of a discussion
      or perceived agreement, aligning with its core sense of 'from the very origin' to correct a foundational
      misunderstanding.
post_example_writeup: The examples above illustrate how 「そもそも」 and 「そもそもの」 are used to introduce fundamental
  points, question assumptions, or highlight the origins of a situation or idea. The choice between 「そもそも」
  and 「そもそもの」 depends on whether you are modifying a sentence or a noun.
