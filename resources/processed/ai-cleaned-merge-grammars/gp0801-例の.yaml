    "jlpt": "N3",
    "meaning": "The usual; the one we talked about; that certain",
    "details": {
        "Usage": "Used to indicate that the speaker expects the listener to understand which specific item or person is being referred to. It implies a shared understanding or prior conversation about the subject.",
        "Nuance": "Suggests a degree of familiarity or inside knowledge between the speaker and the listener. The referent is not explicitly defined but is assumed to be known to both parties.",
        "Register": "Can be used in various registers, from casual to semi-formal, depending on the context and relationship between speakers."
    },
    "etymology": "「例 (rei)」 means \"example\" or \"custom.\" The addition of 「の (no)」 here works similarly to English \"the,\" pointing to something already known or understood.",
    "writeup": "「例の (rei no)」 is used to refer to something that both the speaker and listener are assumed to be familiar with. Think of it as the Japanese equivalent of saying \"that certain...\" or \"the usual...\" It implies a shared understanding or prior discussion about the subject at hand, so it's more than just 'the'. If you say 「例の場所」, it's not just 'the place,' but a place that you and your listener both know about.",

            "etymology": "レポート is a loan word from English, meaning 'report'.",
            "nuance": "The question 「終わりましたか？」 is polite and suitable for a professional setting. The speaker, an older female manager, assumes the listener, a younger male employee, knows which specific report is being referenced by 「例の」, maintaining a professional yet direct tone."

The speaker is referring to a restaurant that was mentioned earlier, or has been discussed by both parties before, using 「例の」 to imply shared knowledge. The male speaker's use of this familiar tone in an invitation makes it flirty."

            "nuance": "The language 「どうなりましたか？」 is polite and suitable for speaking to a superior in a formal, professional setting. The 「か」 adds a questioning tone, indicating the speaker is seeking information about a previous case, which is unspecified but known to both through 「例の」."
