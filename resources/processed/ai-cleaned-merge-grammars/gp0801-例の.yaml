    },
    "writeup": "The phrase 「例の」, read as *rei no*, is used to refer to something specific that both the speaker and the listener are assumed to be familiar with. It's similar to saying \"the usual\" or \"that thing\" in English.  It indicates a shared understanding or a previous discussion about the topic. Because 「例の」 relies on shared context, it's **important** that both parties are indeed on the same page, or it can lead to confusion. Often used in casual conversation, but can appear in more formal settings when the context is well-established.",
    "etymology": "「例 (rei)」 means \"example\" or \"usual,\" and 「の (no)」 is a possessive particle. Therefore, 「例の」 literally translates to \"of the usual\" or \"of the example,\" implying that the following noun is a known or previously mentioned entity.",
