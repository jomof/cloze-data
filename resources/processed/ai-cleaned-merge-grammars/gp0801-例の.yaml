        "usage-context": "Used to indicate that the speaker expects the listener to understand which specific item or person is being referred to. It implies a shared understanding or prior conversation about the subject.",
        "nuance": "Suggests a degree of familiarity or inside knowledge between the speaker and the listener. The referent is not explicitly defined but is assumed to be known to both parties. It often implies a specific, often implicit, reference.",
        "colocation": "Often precedes nouns that represent objects, places, or matters that have been previously discussed or are commonly known between the speakers. E.g., 「例の場所」 (the usual place), 「例の件」 (that matter/case), 「例の人」 (that person we know/talked about)."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「例の」 (rei no) combines 「例」 (rei), derived from the Chinese character 例 (lì), meaning \"example,\" \"precedent,\" or \"custom,\" with the Japanese possessive particle 「の」 (no). Historically, 「例」 referred to an established rule, custom, or a specific instance. The addition of 「の」 transforms it into a modifier, functioning similarly to how English uses \"the\" when referring to something previously established or commonly understood. Over time, its usage evolved from literally meaning \"of the example/custom\" to implying \"that familiar one,\" \"the usual one,\" or \"the one we've already discussed.\" It's a linguistic shortcut that relies heavily on shared context between speakers.",
    "writeup": "「例の」 (rei no) is a versatile phrase used to refer to a noun that both the speaker and the listener are already familiar with. It presumes a **shared context** or **prior knowledge** about the subject being discussed. When you use 「例の」, you're signaling to your listener, \"You know which one I'm talking about, right?\" This makes communication efficient and creates a sense of intimacy or shared understanding between the conversants.\n\nThink of it as Japanese's way of saying \"that *certain*...\" or \"the *usual*...\" It's more specific than simply 「あの」 (ano), which is a demonstrative pronoun meaning \"that\" and can point to something physically distant or conceptually general. 「あの」 does not necessarily imply a prior shared understanding. In contrast, 「例の」 always points to something that has been part of a previous conversation, a common routine, or is otherwise mutually understood without needing explicit re-introduction.\n\nFor example, if you say 「例の場所」 (rei no basho), you don't mean just \"that place\" (「あの場所」), but \"*the* place (that we both know about, that we always go to, etc.).\" This nuance of shared, internal knowledge is what distinguishes 「例の」 and makes it a powerful tool for concise and familiar communication.",

        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To differentiate between 「例の」 and similar expressions like 「あの」 and 「普通の」, consider the context of shared knowledge. 「あの」 is a general demonstrative, simply pointing to something 'that' is over there or 'that' one. It doesn't presuppose that the listener knows exactly what you're talking about beyond its immediate presence or identification. For instance, 「あの本」 means 'that book' (pointing to it). \n\nConversely, 「例の」 always implies that the item, person, or matter has been previously discussed or is a common reference point between the speaker and listener. If you say 「例の本」, it's not just 'that book,' but 'the book we've talked about' or 'the book everybody knows about.' It acts as a verbal shorthand for a specific, mutually understood referent. \n\n「普通の」 means 'normal' or 'ordinary.' While 「例の」 can sometimes translate to 'the usual,' it carries the nuance of a 'usual' specific to the speaker and listener's shared experience, not a general normality. For example, 「普通のカフェ」 is just 'a normal cafe,' whereas 「例のカフェ」 is 'the cafe we always go to' or 'the cafe we talked about.' The key is whether there's a specific, shared, and often unstated background knowledge about the item.",
