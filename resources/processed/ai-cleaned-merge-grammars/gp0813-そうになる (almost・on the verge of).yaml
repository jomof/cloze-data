pronunciation:
  katakana: ソウニナル
  romaji: sou ni naru
formation:
  Verb (ます stem) + そうになる: Expresses that an action or event almost occurred.
jlpt: N3
details:
  register: casual
  usage-context: Indicates that an event nearly occurred but was ultimately avoided.
etymology: The grammar point 「そうになる」 combines 「そう」, indicating a state or appearance, with 「になる」, meaning
  "to become". Therefore, it literally means "to become like that state," implying that something is on
  the verge of happening.
writeup: 'The grammar point 「そうになる」 expresses that something almost happened. It''s used to convey a sense
  of near occurrence or being on the verge of something. The structure is typically: Verb (ます stem) +
  「そうになる」. This grammar point is commonly used in spoken Japanese to describe situations where an action
  or event nearly occurred but was ultimately avoided. It highlights the *proximity* to an event without
  necessarily emphasizing the speaker''s relief or regret, unlike some similar expressions.'
false_friends:
  - term: '[Adj-stem]・[V-stem]そうだ (looks・seems like)'
    meaning: looks like; seems like; appears that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そう」 is used to describe something based on appearance or hearsay, while 「そうになる」 indicates
      that something almost occurred.
    grammar_point: '[Adj・V-stem]そうだ (it looks・seems like)'
  - term: ところだった (near miss)
    meaning: was about to; nearly did
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both 「そうになる」 and 「ところだった」 express that something almost happened, but 「ところだった」 often implies
      a sense of relief or regret, while 「そうになる」 focuses on the near occurrence itself.
    grammar_point: ところだった (near miss)
  - term: そうにない・そうもない (unlikely to)
    meaning: unlikely to
    kind: antonym
    nuance: While 「そうになる」 indicates something is on the verge of happening, 「そうにない」 indicates that something
      is unlikely to happen or shows no signs of happening.
    grammar_point: そうにない・そうもない (unlikely to)
  - term: かける (half-done)
    meaning: half-done; on the verge of starting
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そうになる」 emphasizes being on the verge of *completing* an action or entering a state, often
      involuntarily. 「かける」 implies an action is *halfway done* or *just beginning* and is still incomplete.
    grammar_point: かけ (incomplete or on the verge)
  - term: Verb[volitional]+とする (try about to)
    meaning: to try to; to be about to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そうになる」 describes an involuntary or natural progression towards a state or action. In contrast,
      「Verb[volitional]+とする」 indicates a *deliberate intention* to do something or being *on the point*
      of doing it with effort.
    grammar_point: Verb[volitional]+とする (try about to)
  - term: 危うく
    meaning: barely; narrowly; almost
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そうになる」 describes the internal state of being on the verge of an action or state. 「危うく」 is
      an adverb emphasizing that something negative *almost* happened but was narrowly avoided, similar
      to 「ところだった」 in nuance but modifying the entire clause.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:危うく (barely・almost)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「そう」 indicates appearance or hearsay, 「そうになる」 specifies that an action
  or event nearly occurred or is on the verge of happening. In contrast, 「そうにない」 suggests that an action
  or event is unlikely to happen, serving as an antonym. 「ところだった」 similarly expresses a near occurrence
  but often implies a sense of relief or regret. 「かける」 denotes an action that is halfway done or just
  beginning, not simply on the verge. 「Verb[volitional]+とする」 implies a deliberate attempt or intention
  to do something. Lastly, the adverb 「危うく」 highlights that something negative was narrowly avoided. When
  you want to simply state that something was on the brink of happening due to circumstances or an involuntary
  impulse, 「そうになる」 is often the more neutral choice.
examples:
  - english: I fell asleep on the train and almost missed my stop.
    japanese:
      - 電車 で 眠っ て、乗り過ごし {そう に なっ た}。
      - 電車 で 眠っ て、乗り過ごし {そう に なり まし た}。
    english_literally: On train, slept, almost missed my stop.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 電車 で 眠っ て、乗り過ごす {ところ だっ た}。
        english: I fell asleep on the train and was on the verge of missing my stop (and I'm relieved
          I didn't).
        hint: 「ところだった」 often implies relief or regret that something *almost* happened but was avoided.
          「そうになる」 focuses more on the near occurrence itself without as strong an emotional implication
          of relief/regret. We're describing the near miss.

        english: I was holding a hot coffee and was on the verge of dropping it (and I'm relieved I didn't).
        hint: 「ところだった」 implies a sense of relief or regret that an action was narrowly avoided. 「そうになる」
          describes the state of being on the verge of an action, focusing on the proximity of the event.
          We're describing the near drop itself.

          didn't).
        hint: While both express a near occurrence, 「ところだった」 carries a stronger nuance of relief or regret
          regarding the unfulfilled action. 「そうになる」 expresses being on the verge of doing something, often
          due to an internal feeling or impulse. Here, it emphasizes the strong impulse.

          effect of a long presentation.

        english: The exam was so difficult that I was on the verge of giving up halfway through, but I
          persevered.
        hint: 「ところだった」 can convey relief or regret. 「そうになる」 highlights the internal feeling of being on
          the verge of an action, emphasizing the mental state rather than the fortunate outcome. We're
          emphasizing the internal struggle.

          to hold it in.
        hint: 「そうになる」 emphasizes the involuntary nature of the near-action and the internal struggle to
          prevent it. 「ところだった」 can also be used, but 「そうになる」 fits well with uncontrollable impulses. We're
          describing the near-uncontrollable urge.

        hint: 「そうになる」 emphasizes the spontaneous or natural progression towards a state, especially an
          emotional one. 「ところだった」 can imply a more decisive turning point or a conscious avoidance. We're

          me.
        hint: 「そうになる」 describes a situation where an action nearly occurs as a natural consequence. 「ところだった」

        hint: 「そうになる」 describes an action that was almost performed, often driven by an involuntary impulse.
          「ところだった」 can also be used but may suggest a more conscious decision to pull back. We're describing
          the strong, almost uncontrolled urge.
    scene: A woman confessing to her female friend about a moment of weakness during her diet.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate

    nuance: The sentence-ending particle 「のよ」 is a gentle, somewhat emphatic, and common ending used by
      female speakers, conveying a sense of personal feeling or explanation.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 「そうになる」 is versatile for describing moments where
  an action or state was nearly realized but ultimately wasn't. It's often used when an external circumstance
  or internal impulse brings one to the brink of something, highlighting the close call.
