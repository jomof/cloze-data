jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: general
  function: Expresses that a certain outcome is natural, expected, or justified given a specific reason,
    condition, or effort, often with a sense of confirmation or admiration.
  nuance: This pattern highlights that the result is a natural, heightened, or justified consequence of
    the preceding condition or effort. It carries a sense of inevitability, confirmation, or admiration
    for the outcome, often implying that the effort or quality invested was worthwhile. While 「だけに」 can
    sometimes apply to broader natural consequences (which may include a less positive aspect, but is
    still expected), 「だけあって」 and 「だけのことはある」 specifically emphasize positive or deserved outcomes, with
    「だけのことはある」 often carrying the strongest sense of 'it paid off' or 'it was worth it'.
  colocation: Often used with adverbs like さすが (sasuga, as expected), やはり (yahari, as I thought), or やっぱり
    (yappari, as I thought).
  grammatical-role: Functions to link a preceding condition or reason to a consequential outcome, often
    appearing at the end of a clause.
  logical-flow: Cause and Effect (Expected or Justified Outcome)
etymology: The grammar points 「だけに」, 「だけあって」, and 「だけのことはある」 all stem from the core concept of 「だけ」 (dake),
  meaning "only" or "just," combined with elements that emphasize a consequential relationship. 「に」 (ni)
  indicates reason or cause, 「あって」 (atte) is the te-form of 「ある」 (aru), to be/exist, implying "being the
  case," and 「こと は ある」 (koto wa aru) literally means "there is the matter," suggesting justification or
  worth. Together, they convey that the outcome is precisely what would be expected or is well-justified
  given the preceding condition, effort, or reputation.
writeup: |-
  The grammar patterns 「だけに」, 「だけあって」, and 「だけのことはある」 are used to express that a certain outcome or state is natural, expected, or justified because of a particular reason, condition, or characteristic. They highlight that given a certain attribute, situation, or effort, a specific result is not surprising.

  **だけに** emphasizes that an outcome is a natural and often heightened consequence of a specific preceding factor. It highlights the direct and logical link between cause and effect, suggesting an inevitability or amplification of the result. It can relate to difficulty, emotional reaction, volume, or anything quantifiable, and can sometimes be used in contexts where the outcome isn't strictly positive, but is still a direct and expected result of the situation.

  **だけあって** is used to convey that something is natural, expected, or justified due to a specific reason, condition, or characteristic. It highlights that, given a certain attribute or situation, a specific positive outcome is not surprising. This pattern implies that the innate trait or characteristic of the subject logically led to the positive result. It is strictly used when the reason or result is considered positive or a justifiable outcome.

  **だけのことはある** is a versatile expression used to convey that a certain outcome or state is "as expected" or "not surprising," given a particular preceding condition. It is typically employed when the outcome is positive or desirable, signifying that the effort, quality, or circumstances leading to it were worthwhile and naturally led to the observed result. This pattern frequently appears with adverbs such as さすが (sasuga, as expected) or やはり/やっぱり (yahari/yappari, as I thought), which further emphasize the sense of a confirmed expectation.

  **Key Difference**: While all three share the core idea of an expected outcome, the primary distinction lies in their nuance regarding the outcome's positivity and the sense of justification. 「だけに」 emphasizes a natural consequence, which might not always be positive but is a direct result. 「だけあって」 and 「だけのことはある」 specifically imply a positive or justified outcome, with 「だけのことはある」 often carrying the strongest sense of satisfaction that an effort or investment "paid off."

  **Formation Summary**:
  *   **Verb (plain form)** + だけに / だけあって / だけのことはある
  *   **い-adjective (plain form)** + だけに / だけあって / だけのことはある
  *   **な-adjective (stem + な)** + だけに / だけあって / だけのことはある

  - term: わけだ
    meaning: For that reason, no wonder, as you'd expect, naturally, thus, this is why
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「〜だけあって・〜だけに・〜だけのことはある」, which implies a justified or expected outcome given a specific
      condition, 「わけだ」 explains a logical conclusion or a realization based on observed information, often
      akin to 'no wonder' or 'that means'. It states the reason or consequence, but without the strong
      emphasis on an outcome being a natural, almost inevitable, or well-deserved result.
    grammar_point: わけだ (logical conclusion)
  - term: からこそ
    meaning: Precisely because, that's why, for that very reason
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「〜だけあって・〜だけに・〜だけのことはある」 indicates an expected or heightened outcome due to a natural
      consequence, 「からこそ」 emphasizes the cause as the unique or singularly critical reason for the result,
      often implying that the result would not have happened otherwise or is particularly strong due to
      this specific reason. It highlights the indispensable nature of the cause.
    grammar_point: からこそ (emphasized reason)
  - term: だけで
    meaning: Just by; only with
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「〜だけあって・〜だけに・〜だけのことはある」, which implies a natural or expected positive result from a
      condition, 「だけで」 indicates a simple condition or means by which something is achieved, without implying
      a natural or justified outcome. It simply means 'just by doing X' or 'only with X'.
    grammar_point: だけで (just by)
post_false_friends_writeup: These expressions all relate to cause and effect, but with different nuances.
  「〜だけあって・〜だけに・〜だけのことはある」 emphasizes that a particular outcome is a natural, expected, or justified consequence
  of a specific preceding factor or effort. It carries a sense of 'it paid off' or 'it was only natural
  given the circumstances'. In contrast, 「わけだ」 primarily serves to explain a logical conclusion or a realization,
  often translating to 'no wonder'. 「からこそ」 highlights a cause as the exclusive or most significant reason
  for an outcome, implying that the result hinges critically on this unique factor. 「だけで」 simply states
  a condition or means, meaning 'just by' or 'only with', without the evaluative or natural consequence
  implication of the other phrases.
examples:
  - english: My friend has lived in Japan for a long time, so it's natural they also understand dialects
      well.
    japanese:
      - 私 の 友達 は 日本 で 長く 暮らし て いる {だけ に}、方言 も よく わかる。
      - 私 の 友達 は 日本 で 長く 暮らし て いる {だけ に}、方言 も よく わかり ます。

      dialects well.

          - 私 の 友達 は 日本 で 長く 暮らし て いる {の で}、方言 も よく わかる。
        english: My friend lives in Japan for a long time, so they also understand dialects well.
        hint: While 「ので」 states a reason, 「だけに」 adds the nuance that the outcome is an expected and natural
          consequence of the preceding condition. We're looking for an expression that emphasizes this
          natural expectation.
    scene: Two male friends are discussing a mutual acquaintance's deep understanding of Japanese culture
      beyond standard Japanese.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The informal tone and the use of 「わかる」 (understand) in the casual register reflect everyday
      conversation. 「方言」 (dialect) is a natural topic when someone has lived in Japan for an extended
      period, implying a depth of understanding expected from their experience. The use of 「だけに」 emphasizes
      that this understanding is a natural consequence of their long residency, making it an expected
      outcome.
    etymology: The concept of 'long residency' (長く暮らし て いる) naturally leads to a deep understanding, which
      is why the use of だけに feels appropriate here.
  - english: That famous restaurant is right in front of the station, so as expected, it's always fully

        english: That famous restaurant is in front of the station, so it's always fully booked.
        hint: 「ので」 states a simple cause-and-effect. 「だけに」 emphasizes that the restaurant's location naturally
          leads to it being fully booked, making it an expected outcome. We're looking for an expression
          that conveys this natural expectation.
    scene: Two women trying to get a reservation at a popular restaurant.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The polite form 「です」 at the end of the sentence is appropriate for a semi-formal context.
      Being 「駅前 に ある」 (located in front of the station) suggests high demand, making 「予約 で いっぱい」 (fully
      booked) a natural and expected outcome. 「だけに」 here highlights that the high demand is an expected
      outcome due to its location.

        english: Because the scenery there is beautiful, many tourists gather.
        hint: While 「ので」 gives a reason, 「だけに」 strongly suggests that the beautiful scenery is the very
          reason, the natural and expected cause, for many tourists gathering. We're looking for an expression
          that emphasizes this inherent connection.
    scene: A local explaining the popularity of a scenic spot to a visitor.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: The adjective 「きれい」 (beautiful) is modified by 「な」 to connect with 「だけに」, clearly showing
      that the beauty of the scenery is the direct and expected reason for the large number of tourists.
      This example demonstrates the 「な-adjective + な + だけに」 formation. The casual register fits a friendly
      conversation.
  - english: That new smartphone has excellent features, so it's no surprise it sold out immediately after

          the specific reason for its immediate sell-out, making it a highly expected and natural result.
          We're looking for an expression that emphasizes this expected outcome.
    scene: A tech reviewer discussing the immense popularity and quick sell-out of a new device.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The phrase 「機能 が 優れ て いる」 (excellent features) directly explains why the smartphone would
      quickly sell out, leading to the expected outcome of 「品切れ に なっ た」 (sold out). This is an objective
      observation typical in an informative context. 「だけに」 underscores that the sell-out is a direct,
      unsurprising consequence of its superior quality.
  - english: The department store on the weekend was on sale, so as expected, it was incredibly crowded.
    japanese:

        english: The department store on the weekend was on sale, so it was incredibly crowded.

    scene: A person lamenting the crowded department store they visited on the weekend.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The fact that the department store was 「セール 中」 (on sale) is a clear reason for the 「すごい 混雑」
      (terrible crowdedness), which is an expected outcome. The casual tone and slightly negative reflection
      fit the context of discussing a frustrating experience. 「だけに」 emphasizes that the crowding was a
      natural and expected result of the sale.

      making the disappointment 「悔しく て 涙 が 止まら なかっ た」 (so frustrated tears wouldn't stop) a natural, amplified
      emotional response. This introspective statement is suitable for personal reflection. 「だけに」 highlights
      how the depth of their effort directly led to the intensity of their disappointment, making it an
      expected reaction.

    scene: Two friends are trying ramen from a newly visited shop that has a strong reputation.

          expected quality. We're looking for a grammar point that expresses a justified expectation.

          - この 本 は 長い 時間 かけ て 読ん だ。読み 終わっ た 時 の 感動 は、やはり 難しかっ た の も {納得 だ}。
        english: I spent a long time reading this book. The emotion I felt when I finished reading it
          showed it was understandable that it was difficult.
        hint: 「難しかった のも 納得だ」 means 'it was understandable that it was difficult'. '{だけのことはある}' emphasizes
          that the difficulty was justified by the profound emotional reward of finishing it. We're looking
          for a phrase that confirms the challenge was worthwhile.
    scene: Someone reflecting on a challenging book they finally finished.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
post_example_writeup: The patterns 「だけに」, 「だけあって」, and 「だけのことはある」 are powerful tools to express a logical
  and often positive relationship between a cause and an expected or justified outcome. They go beyond
  simple causality by adding a nuance of inevitability, confirmation, or the sense that effort or investment
  was indeed worthwhile. Choosing the right form depends on whether you want to emphasize a natural consequence
  (だけに), a justified positive outcome (だけあって), or a deserved reward (だけのことはある).
