        "function": "Expresses strong prohibition, a firm warning, or an inherent impossibility/unsuitability, often carrying a moral or logical imperative.",
        "nuance": "Carries a sense of inherent obligation or strong moral/logical necessity for non-occurrence, distinct from simple prohibition. It implies a fixed, universal rule or principle rather than a personal command or suggestion. It conveys a rigid, often impersonal tone, fitting for regulations or proverbs."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「べからず」 is rooted in classical Japanese. It combines the 未然形 (imperfective form) 「べから」 of the classical auxiliary verb 「べし」, which expresses obligation, suitability, or strong assertion, with 「ず」, a classical negative auxiliary verb. Thus, it literally signifies \"it should not be so\" or \"it is not proper to do,\" conveying a firm prohibition or a state that ought not to exist. The related form 「べからざる」 is the 連体形 (attributive form) of 「べからず」, used to modify nouns.",
    "writeup": "「べからず」 and its attributive form 「べからざる」 are formal expressions used to convey a strong sense of prohibition or an inherent impossibility, similar to \"must not\" or \"should not.\" Their origins lie in classical Japanese, combining the root of the auxiliary verb 「べし」 (expressing obligation or suitability) with the classical negative auxiliary verb 「ず」. This etymology lends them a nuance of moral or logical imperative, indicating something that inherently ought not to be.\n\nIn modern Japanese, while retaining this strong, often absolute prohibition, their usage has become quite specialized. They are predominantly encountered in **written form on signs, public notices, official documents, or in highly formal and literary contexts**, such as proverbs or philosophical statements. They are rarely used in casual spoken Japanese.\n\n**Usage:**\n*   **べからず**: Typically follows a verb in its dictionary form to state a direct prohibition. For example, 「立ち入るべからず」 (Do not enter) or 「禁煙するべからず」 (Do not smoke).\n*   **べからざる**: This form acts as an adjective, modifying a subsequent noun. It denotes that the noun is inherently in a state that should not exist or is impossible. It often appears in set phrases:\n    *   **許すべからざる** (unforgivable; literally: that which must not be forgiven)\n    *   **欠くべからざる** (indispensable; literally: that which must not be lacked)\n    *   **ありうべからざる** (impossible; literally: that which must not exist)\n\nFor the verb する, both 「するべからず」 and the more classical 「すべからず」 are acceptable, though the latter is more common in fixed expressions and older texts. The rigid and impersonal nature of 「べからず」 patterns makes them suitable for universal rules rather than personal requests or admonitions.",

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「べからず」, 「～てはいけない」, 「～てはならない」, 「～するな」, and 「禁止」 all convey prohibition, their nuances and usage contexts differ significantly. 「べからず」 maintains a particularly formal, rigid, and often archaic tone, making it ideal for explicit, impersonal rules typically found on signs or in official documents. In contrast, 「～てはいけない」 is more common in everyday discourse, expressing general prohibitions. 「～てはならない」 is also formal but more broadly applicable than 「べからず」, conveying moral or legal necessities. 「～するな」 is a direct, casual command. Finally, 「禁止」 is a noun used to state that something is forbidden, often combined with a noun or verb to form a complete prohibition statement.",
