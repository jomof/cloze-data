    "etymology": "The grammar point 「べからず」 is derived from 「べし」, an auxiliary verb expressing obligation or suitability, combined with 「から」 (from) and 「ず」 (not). Thus, it literally means something like \"it should not be from\", indicating a prohibition.",
    "writeup": "「べからず」 is a formal expression indicating a strong prohibition, similar to \"must not\" or \"should not\". It is most often seen on signs and notices. It is a combination of the auxiliary verb 「べし」 (expressing obligation) in its 未然形 (imperfective form) 「べから」, and the classical auxiliary verb 「ず」 (not). It conveys a stronger sense of prohibition than other similar grammar points.",
