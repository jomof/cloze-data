etymology: The particle って is a contraction of と言って (to say and), providing a more casual and abbreviated
  way to introduce reported speech or thoughts. Its evolution reflects the natural tendency in spoken
  language to shorten frequently used phrases.
writeup: The particle って serves as a highly casual quotation marker in Japanese. It is primarily used
  in informal conversation to report what someone said, thought, or heard. It functions similarly to the
  more formal と (quotation marker) but carries a significantly more relaxed and conversational tone. Think
  of it as a shorthand for phrases like と言った (said that) or と聞いた (heard that). Because of its informal
  nature, って is frequently used among close friends and family, and generally avoided in formal or polite
  contexts. It's often found at the end of a casual verb, い-adjective, な-adjective, or noun to directly
  quote or summarize its content.
false_friends:
  - term: と (quotation marker)
    meaning: direct or indirect quotation marker
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While と also marks quotations, it is more formal and versatile. って is strictly casual and
      tends to be used for shorter, more direct reports in conversation. と can be used in both formal
      and casual settings, whereas って is limited to casual.
    grammar_point: と (quotation marker)
  - term: んだって (I heard, casual)
    meaning: I heard that...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: んだって explicitly conveys that the information is hearsay or something the speaker recently
      learned, emphasizing 'I heard'. って, when used for quotation, can imply hearsay but doesn't always
      emphasize it to the same degree. んだって adds the nuance of explanation (ん).
    grammar_point: んだって (I heard, casual)
  - term: って (casual quotation・reason・topic)
    meaning: casual quotation, reason, or topic marker
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This grammar point, 'って (quotation marker, casual)', specifically focuses on its function
      as a quotation marker. The broader particle 'って' can also be used to introduce a topic or provide
      a casual reason, functions which are distinct from pure quotation and are covered by the more general
      grammar point.
    grammar_point: って (casual quotation・reason・topic)
  - term: だって (even・too・because)
    meaning: even, too, because
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The だって construction has multiple uses, including 'even/too' (e.g., 子供だって分かる - even a child
      would understand) or providing a reason (e.g., 疲れたんだって - because I'm tired). While 'って' is part
      of it, its overall function is different from solely marking a quotation.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:だって (even・too・because)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between って and と, remember that って is almost exclusively
  for casual, spoken contexts and often implies a more immediate or overheard piece of information. と,
  on the other hand, is suitable for both casual and formal speech, and can introduce more complex reported
  clauses. For んだって, the added ん emphasizes that the statement is explanatory and based on something the
  speaker heard, making the hearsay aspect more prominent than with a simple って. Finally, be aware that
  って also has other uses beyond quotation, such as marking a topic or giving a casual reason, which are
  distinct from its use as a quotation marker.

    scene: A friend is reporting what another friend said.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「お腹 空いた」{って} expresses a direct, casual quote from the friend. The speaker, being

    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 「帰る{って}言ってたよ」 uses the casual form of the verb 帰る followed by って, showing that
      the speaker is casually reporting what the male colleague said. The final よ adds a sense of informing
      the listener.

    register: casual
    setting: friendly

        english: I heard the test was difficult.

    register: casual
    setting: academic
    nuance: The phrase 「難しかった{って}聞いたよ」 is used to report something heard. The use of って indicates the

    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The very concise 「秘密{って}。」 implies 'They said it's a secret' or 'It's supposed to be a secret'
      in a very casual context, omitting the verb. It's often used when conveying information that was
      stated briefly or matter-of-factly.

          a more immediate internal thought.

    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「無理{って}思ってるのかな」 indicates speculation about someone's casual thought. The って makes the reported
      thought feel more immediate or a direct reflection of their feeling. The final かな expresses personal
      wonder or uncertainty.
post_example_writeup: The examples provided illustrate って's versatility in casual communication, whether
  quoting someone directly, reporting overheard information, or even expressing internal thoughts. The
  brevity of some examples, where the verb 'to say' is omitted, highlights its integration into highly
  informal, natural speech patterns. Understanding these nuances is key to sounding more like a native
  speaker.
