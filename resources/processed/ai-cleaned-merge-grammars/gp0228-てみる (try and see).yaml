pronunciation:
  katakana: テミル
  romaji: te miru
  pronunciation_warning: While 見る can be used, its use strongly emphasizes the 'see' aspect over the 'try'
    aspect, which can lead to misinterpretation.
formation:
  Verb in te-form + てみる: Expresses trying something to see what it's like or what will happen.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  usage-context: general
etymology: The grammar point 「てみる」 is formed by combining the te-form of a verb with the auxiliary verb
  「みる」, which literally means 'to see'. This fusion semantically evolves into the meaning of 'to try and
  see' or 'to try out'. The underlying idea is to perform an action to observe its outcome or to gain
  experience. This linguistic construction highlights the experimental or experiential nature of the action,
  as if one is performing an action to visually 'see' the result.
writeup: 'The grammar point 「てみる」 (temiru) is used to express the idea of trying something to see what
  happens or to gain experience. It combines the te-form of a verb with the auxiliary verb 「みる」 (miru),
  which literally means ''to see''. This structure implies that the action is performed with an exploratory
  or experimental intent. You are not just doing something, but doing it to ''see'' the result or to ''try
  it out''. This construction is often employed when someone is trying something for the **first time**,
  or when suggesting that someone else **should try something new**. For instance, if recommending an
  activity or food, you might say 「〜てみて」 (temite) in a casual setting, or 「〜てみてください」 (temite kudasai)
  for a more formal or polite request. In highly casual speech, especially among close friends, the 「て」
  particle may sometimes be omitted, resulting in just 「〜み」 (mi). This carries a nuance of urging someone
  to ''just give it a go!'' or ''come on, try it!''. A crucial nuance to understand is that when 「てみる」
  is used in the **past tense** (e.g., 「〜てみた」), it often carries the implication that the attempt was
  **successful** or that the speaker gained some insight from the experience, unless explicitly stated
  otherwise. **Important Note**: While the auxiliary 「みる」 is almost always written in hiragana (みる), using
  the kanji 「見る」 would heavily emphasize the literal meaning of ''to see''. This can lead to misunderstanding,
  as the focus shifts from ''trying something out'' to ''seeing something'' in a literal sense. Therefore,
  it is generally advised to write 「みる」 in hiragana in this grammatical context.'
false_friends:
  - term: てごらん
    meaning: (Please) try to, (Please) look
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「てごらん」 is often used by someone older or in a position of authority to suggest or instruct
      someone younger or of lower status to try something. It has a slightly commanding or instructing
      tone, whereas 「てみる」 is a neutral expression of trying.
    grammar_point: Verb[て] + ごらん (gentle suggestion)
  - term: 〜ようと思う・〜おうと思う
    meaning: I think I will, I think I shall, Going to, Gonna (Volitional+思う)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「てみる」, 「〜ようと思う」 expresses an intention or plan to do something in the future, without
      necessarily implying an experimental 'try and see' nuance. It simply states a decision.
    grammar_point: Verb[volitional-よう]+思う (intend to or think I will)
  - term: ようにする
    meaning: To try to, To make sure to, To endeavor to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ようにする」 implies a continuous effort or a conscious attempt to make something a habit or to
      ensure something happens regularly. It lacks the one-time, experimental 'try out' nuance of 「てみる」.
    grammar_point: ようにする (make an effort to)
  - term: Verb[volitional]とする
    meaning: Try to, Attempt to, To be about to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「Verb[volitional]とする」 also means 'try to,' it often describes an attempt that is either
      in progress or about to happen, focusing on the *effort* or *beginning* of an action. 「てみる」 is more
      about performing the action to experience or observe the outcome.
    grammar_point: Verb[volitional]+とする (try about to)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「てみる」 is about experimenting and seeing
  what happens, while the other expressions have different nuances, such as continuous effort, intention,
  or a command to try something.
examples:
  - english: I'll go try out the new restaurant.
    japanese:
      - 新しい レストラン に 行っ て {みる}。
      - 新しい レストラン に 行っ て {み ます}。
      - 新しい レストラン に 行っ て {みよう} と 思う。
    english_literally: I will go and see the new restaurant.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新しい レストラン に {行く}。
        english: I'll go to the new restaurant.
        hint: The nuance of 'trying something out to see what happens' is missing in the simple verb form.
          We're looking for an expression that suggests an experimental visit.
    scene: A person is deciding where to eat dinner and considers a recently opened place.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: This casual expression indicates an exploratory action. The speaker is not just going, but
      going to 'try out' and 'see' what the new restaurant is like. The usage of 「〜てみる」 implies a sense
      of curiosity and an experimental approach.
    etymology: The verb 「行く」 (iku) means 'to go'. When combined with 「てみる」, it shifts the meaning to 'go
      and try out', emphasizing the exploratory nature of the visit rather than just the action of going.
      This specific phrasing highlights a modern, casual approach to trying new experiences, common among
      younger speakers who are open to new things.
  - english: Would you like to try this cake?
    japanese:
      - この ケーキ を 食べ {て み ます} か。
      - この ケーキ、食べ {て みる}？
      - この ケーキ、召し上がっ {て み ます} か。
      - この ケーキ、食べ {て み ない}？
    english_literally: Will you eat and see this cake?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この ケーキ を {食べ ます} か。
        english: Will you eat this cake?
        hint: The simple polite question just asks if you will eat, lacking the nuance of inviting someone
          to 'experience' or 'taste and see' the cake. We're looking for an invitation to try.
    scene: A friend is offering a freshly baked cake to a guest.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The polite form 「〜てみますか」 is used to gently suggest or invite someone to try something, emphasizing
      the act of tasting to experience it. The feminine nuance in offering food is subtle but common.
      The phrase 「食べ て みますか」 sounds softer and more inviting than a direct 「食べますか」, which might sound
      like a simple inquiry about eating.
    etymology: The verb 「食べる」 (taberu) means 'to eat'. Adding 「〜てみますか」 to it turns a direct question about
      eating into an invitation to 'try and see' or 'taste' the cake. This construction, often used in
      polite social contexts, makes the offer less direct and more about the experience.
  - english: Just try touching it for a moment.
    japanese:
      - ちょっと だけ 触っ て {み て}。
      - ちょっと だけ 触っ て {み て ください}。
      - ちょっと 触っ て {みろ} よ。
      - ちょっと 触っ て {みろ}。
    english_literally: Touch and see it just a little.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ちょっと だけ {触っ て}。
        english: Just touch it for a moment.
        hint: The simple te-form is a direct request to touch, without the nuance of encouraging someone
          to 'try it out' or 'see what happens'. We're looking for an encouragement to experience something.
    scene: A child is hesitant to touch a harmless but unfamiliar object.
    register: casual
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The casual command 「〜てみて」 encourages someone to perform an action experimentally, to see what
      happens or how it feels. It's often used by an older person or parent to a child to gently push
      them past hesitation. The use of 「ちょっと だけ」 further softens the request, making it less intimidating.
      This is typical of a comforting and instructive tone often used by parents.
    etymology: The verb 「触る」 (sawaru) means 'to touch'. The te-form 「触って」 combined with 「みて」 forms an
      encouraging command to 'try touching'. This structure is very common in direct, informal communication
      where one person is guiding another through an experience, particularly when overcoming apprehension.
      The use of 「だけ」 (dake) limits the action, making it seem less daunting.
  - english: Please try downloading this app.
    japanese:
      - この アプリ を ダウンロード し {て み て ください}。
      - この アプリ を ダウンロード し {て み て いただけ ます} か。
      - この アプリ、ダウンロード し {て み て 頂戴}。
    english_literally: Please download and see this app.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この アプリ を ダウンロード {し て ください}。
        english: Please download this app.
        hint: The simple polite request is a direct instruction, not suggesting an experimental action
          to see if it works or to gain experience. We're looking for a polite request to try something
          out.
    scene: A customer service representative is guiding a user through troubleshooting steps.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: In a professional context, 「〜てみてください」 is a polite request to 'try out' an action, often implying
      that the outcome is uncertain or that it's a step in a process (like troubleshooting). The polite
      request is suitable for a customer service representative. While not exclusive to male speakers,
      this clear, instructional tone is common in business Japanese.
    etymology: 「ダウンロードする」 (daunroodo suru) is a suru-verb meaning 'to download'. Its te-form 「ダウンロードして」
      combines with 「みてください」 to form a polite request to 'try downloading'. This phrase is a common way
      to suggest an experimental action, especially in a technical or problem-solving context. The polite
      imperative 「ください」 (kudasai) softens the command, making it a request rather than a direct order.
  - english: I tried applying for the new job, and I passed the exam.
    japanese:
      - 新しい 仕事 に 応募 し {て み た} ら、合格 し た。
      - 新しい 仕事 に 応募 し {て み まし た} ら、合格 し まし た。
      - 新しい 仕事 に 応募 し {て み た} ところ、合格 し た。
    english_literally: When I applied and saw for the new job, I passed.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新しい 仕事 に {応募 し たら}、合格 し た。
        english: When I applied for the new job, I passed the exam.
        hint: This simple conditional sentence describes a cause and effect, but doesn't convey the nuance
          that the application was an experiment or an action taken to see the result. We're looking for
          an expression implying an attempt to see the outcome.
    scene: A young man is excitedly telling his friend about a recent success.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker implies they 'tried' applying, and the success of 'passing' confirms the implicit
      positive outcome often associated with 「てみた」 in the past tense. The casual nature of the sentence
      and the celebratory tone fit a male speaker sharing good news with a friend. The 「〜たら」 conditional
      here implies a discovery or outcome after the action, emphasizing the 'see what happens' aspect
      of 「てみる」.
    etymology: 「応募する」 (ōbo suru) is a suru-verb meaning 'to apply'. When used with 「てみた」, it expresses
      that the speaker 'tried applying' with an exploratory mindset. The inclusion of 「〜たら」 (conditional
      particle) highlights that the passing of the exam was the 'result' or 'discovery' of this attempt.
      This construction is common for sharing personal experiences and outcomes, particularly positive
      ones.
  - english: I tried buying that expensive dress, but it was a little too small.
    japanese:
      - あの 高い 服 を 買っ {て み まし た} が、少し 小さかっ た です。
      - あの 高い 服、買っ {て み た} ん だ けど、ちょっと 小さかっ た。
      - あの 高価 な 服 を 買っ {て み まし た} が、少々 小さかっ た です。
    english_literally: I bought and saw that expensive dress, but it was a little small.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 高い 服 を {買い まし た} が、少し 小さかっ た です。
        english: I bought that expensive dress, but it was a little too small.
        hint: This simply states that the dress was bought, without indicating that the purchase was an
          experiment or an attempt to see how it would fit. We're looking for an expression that suggests
          trying out the purchase.
    scene: A woman is lamenting a shopping mishap to her friend.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The speaker uses 「です」 after 「小さかった」, indicating a polite, yet slightly less formal tone than
      strict 「teineigo」. The explicit mention of the negative outcome ('小さかった です') demonstrates how 「てみる」
      can be used even when the attempt is not successful, provided the failure is stated. This nuance
      is common in polite conversational sharing, often associated with female speakers, who might use
      this structure to share personal experiences with a touch of polite reflection.
    etymology: The verb 「買う」 (kau) means 'to buy'. The phrase 「買っ て み まし た」 signifies 'I tried buying'
      the dress, indicating an exploratory purchase. The conjunction 「が」 (ga) introduces a contrasting
      result ('but it was a little too small'). This construction is used to share an experience where
      the action was taken to see the result, and the result was not as expected, conveying a sense of
      personal reflection.
  - english: It looks interesting, so I'll try doing it too.
    japanese:
      - 面白 そう だ から、私 も やっ {て みよう}。
      - 面白 そう です から、私 も やっ {て み ましょう}。
      - 面白 そう だ から、私 も やっ {て みる} か！
    english_literally: Since it seems interesting, I will also do and see.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 面白 そう だ から、私 も {やろう}。
        english: It looks interesting, so I'll do it too.
        hint: The simple volitional indicates an intention to do something, but doesn't carry the nuance
          of 'trying it out' experimentally. We're looking for an expression of intent to try something
          new.
    scene: Someone is watching a friend attempt a new hobby and decides to join in.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: volitional (～よう)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The volitional form 「〜てみよう」 expresses an intention to try something out, often with a sense
      of excitement or curiosity about the outcome. It's a casual way of saying 'let's try it' or 'I'll
      give it a go'. The phrase 「面白 そう だ から」 provides the motivation, and the volitional ending suits
      the immediate, spontaneous decision often made by younger speakers among friends.
    etymology: 「やる」 (yaru) is a casual verb for 'to do' or 'to try'. Its te-form 「やって」 combines with the
      volitional 「みよう」 to mean 'let's try doing it' or 'I'll try doing it'. This construction is used
      when someone is prompted by curiosity or interest to perform an action to experience it themselves.
      It conveys a strong sense of personal initiative and experimentation.
  - english: Shall we try starting a new project?
    japanese:
      - 新しい プロジェクト を 始め て {み ましょう}。
      - 新しい プロジェクト を 始め {て み て は いかが でしょう} か。
      - 新しい プロジェクト、始め {て み ませ ん か}？
    english_literally: Let's start and see a new project.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新しい プロジェクト を {始め ましょう}。
        english: Shall we start a new project?
        hint: This is a direct suggestion to start, without implying an experimental or trial approach.
          We're looking for a suggestion that involves trying out a new initiative.
    scene: A team leader is proposing a new initiative to their colleagues during a meeting.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: persuasive
    conjugation: volitional polite (～ましょう)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The polite volitional form 「〜てみましょう」 is used to suggest trying something together, often in
      a group or professional setting, implying an experimental or exploratory approach. It's a way to
      invite others to participate in trying out a new idea. This is common for a team leader who wants
      to involve their team in a new venture, using polite yet encouraging language.
    etymology: 「始める」 (hajimeru) means 'to start'. Its te-form 「始めて」 combines with the polite volitional
      「みましょう」 to suggest 'let's try starting' a project. This expression is commonly used in collaborative
      settings to propose an action that is somewhat experimental or whose outcome is not fully certain,
      inviting collective participation to 'see what happens'.
  - english: This method is complicated, so it's better not to try it first.
    japanese:
      - この 方法 は 複雑 だ から、まず は やっ {て み ない} 方 が いい。
      - この 方法 は 複雑 です から、まず は やっ {て み ない} 方 が いい です。
      - この 方法 は 複雑 です から、まず は やっ {て み ない} 方 が よろしい でしょう。
    english_literally: Because this method is complicated, it is better not to do and see it first.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 方法 は 複雑 だ から、まず は {やら ない 方 が いい}。
        english: This method is complicated, so it's better not to do it first.
        hint: This simply advises against doing the method, without emphasizing the specific caution against
          'trying out' or 'experimenting' with it. We're looking for a warning against attempting something
          experimentally.
    scene: A mentor advises a student against trying a difficult approach without prior preparation.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The negative form 「〜てみない方がいい」 advises against trying something, often because it's too difficult
      or risky. It's a cautious warning against an experimental action. This phrasing is typical of a
      mentor offering guidance, emphasizing that the action of 'trying' is not advisable. The inclusion
      of 「まず は」 (first) implies that trying it later, with more preparation, might be acceptable.
    etymology: 「やる」 (yaru) in its te-form 「やって」 combines with the negative 「みない」 and the structure 「方がいい」
      (hō ga ii) to mean 'it is better not to try (doing something)'. This construction is used to express
      a recommendation against an experimental action, highlighting that attempting it might lead to negative
      consequences. It is a practical warning, indicating a preference for not undertaking an action,
      especially if it is complicated or risky.

        english: Someday, I want to soak in a hot spring in Japan.
        hint: This merely states a desire to do something, but doesn't convey the specific nuance of wanting
          to 'experience' or 'try out' the hot spring activity. We're looking for an expression of desire
          to try a new experience.
    scene: A person is expressing their travel aspirations and hopes to experience a traditional hot spring.

    setting: optimistic
    conjugation: desiderative (～たい)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The combination of 「〜てみたい」 with 「です」 expresses a polite desire to try something, often with
      an emphasis on experiencing it personally. It's common for speakers to use this when expressing
      future aspirations or wishes to try something new. The polite 「です」 ending makes it suitable for
      general conversation, and the expressed desire for a unique cultural experience is common for younger,
      optimistic individuals.
    etymology: 「入る」 (hairu) means 'to enter'. Its te-form 「入って」 combined with the desiderative form of
      「みる」, which is 「みたい」 (mitai), means 'want to try entering' or 'want to experience entering'. This
      construction is often used to express a desire to try something new or to have an

          - もし 困っ た ら、先生 に {相談 し たら} どう です か。
        english: If you're in trouble, how about consulting your teacher?
        hint: This phrasing is a direct suggestion, but it lacks the nuance of recommending an action
          as an experiment or a trial to see if it helps. We're looking for a suggestion that invites
          the listener to try an action as a potential solution.
    scene: A classmate offers advice to a struggling peer about seeking help from a teacher.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: supportive
    conjugation: conditional (～たら)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The phrase 「〜てみたらどうですか」 is a polite suggestion to 'try' an action, often implying that it's
      a potential solution worth exploring. It's a softer way of giving advice, inviting the listener
      to consider the experimental action. This supportive tone is common between classmates, with the
      polite ending making it suitable for a semi-formal setting. The phrase 「どうですか」 itself softens the
      suggestion, making it less of a direct instruction.
    etymology: 「相談する」 (sōdan suru) means 'to consult'. Its te-form 「相談して」 combines with the conditional
      form of 「みる」, which is 「みたら」, and the phrase 「どうですか」 (dō desu ka) to mean 'how about trying to consult?'.
      This structure is used to propose an experimental action as a suggestion or a possible solution
      to a problem. It encourages the listener to 'try and see' if the action yields a positive result.

        english: I didn't solve it with that method, but I'll look for another one.
        hint: This simply states that the problem wasn't solved, without specifying that the speaker didn't
          even *attempt* to solve it using that method. We're looking for an expression that indicates
          a specific method was not tried out.
    scene: A team member reports to their superior about a failed attempt to resolve an issue, indicating
      they didn't even attempt that specific method.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: negative past polite (～ませんでした)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: This polite negative past form 「〜てみませんでした」 states that an experimental action was not performed,
      implying a conscious decision or an unattempted approach. It's often used in formal or business
      contexts to report on attempts (or lack thereof) to resolve an issue. The speaker is not merely
      saying they didn't solve it, but that they didn't even 'try that method out', which is a common
      way to report on progress or lack thereof in a professional setting.
    etymology: '「解決する」 (kaiketsu suru) means ''to solve''. Its te-form 「解決して」 combines with the negative
      past polite form of 「みる」, which is 「みませんでした」, meaning ''did not try solving''. This implies that
      a particular method was not even attempted as an experiment. The conjunction 「が」 (ga) introduces
      a contrasting follow-up action: ''but I will look for another method''. This is typical in business
      communication where efforts and alternatives are reported.'
post_example_writeup: Remember that 「てみる」 is often used when someone is trying something for the first
  time. The nuance is one of experimentation or curiosity. In the past tense 「てみた」, it suggests the attempt
  was successful unless otherwise indicated.
