    "etymology": "The phrase 「には及ばない」 combines the particle 「に」, the topic marker 「は」, and the negative form of the verb 「及ぶ」 (to reach, to extend). Literally, it means \"it does not reach (to)\", implying that something does not measure up to a certain standard or level. The expression often carries a nuance of humility or polite comparison, especially when used to praise someone or something else highly.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「には及ばない」 expresses that something is inferior in comparison to something else. It literally translates to \"it does not reach to (A).\" It is often used when making a comparison between two things, usually where (A) is something being given very high praise. This pattern commonly appears after nouns. Common phrases include 「の足元には及ばない」, meaning \"to not even reach the feet of (A),\" implying a significant difference in quality or ability.",
