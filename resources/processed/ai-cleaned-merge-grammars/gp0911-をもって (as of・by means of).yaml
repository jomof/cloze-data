formation:
  '[Noun] + をもって': Indicates 'as of' or 'with' something, often related to time or means.
  '[Abstract Noun] + をもって': Indicates the means or instrument by which an action is performed, often with
    a sense of definitive employment of that abstract concept or quality.
  '[Time/Event] + をもって': Marks a specific point in time or an event as a clear demarcation, usually signaling
    a conclusion or the point at which a decision or state becomes effective. It is rarely used to mark
    a new beginning point.
jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Often used in official announcements, legal documents, formal speeches, and written communications
    to mark a clear point in time for cessation or to denote the means by which something is achieved.
    It is also used to formally conclude events or statements.
  function: To mark a definitive point in time (often an end point) or to indicate the specific means/instrument
    by which an action is performed.
  nuance: Carries a strong nuance of finality, officiality, or a distinct instrumentality. It elevates
    the statement to a more formal and authoritative level than general particles like で or によって. When
    referring to time, it almost exclusively marks an ending or a culmination, not a beginning.
  grammatical-role: Adverbial phrase, modifying the verb or the entire clause.
  temporal-flow: Typically marks the end or culmination of a period or event.
  spatial-flow: Can imply a transition or a definitive boundary in time or circumstance
etymology: 「をもって」 comes from the kanji 「以て」 (もって), which originally meant "by means of." It's related
  to the verb 「持つ」 (もつ), meaning "to hold" or "to have." The nuance suggests "having reached (A)" or "by
  means of (A)".
writeup: The grammar point 「をもって」 is a formal expression that can mean "as of," "with," or "by means of."
  It's often used in official announcements, formal speech, and written documents. When used with expressions
  indicating time or an event at a specific time, it conveys 'as of (A)' or 'effective from (A)'. For
  example, 「本日をもって」 means "as of today." It is a combination of the adverbial particle 「を」 and 「もって」,
  which originally meant "by means of." In highly polite or official contexts, it may be rendered as 「をもちまして」.
  Less commonly, the small っ (促音, sokuon) may be dropped, resulting in 「をもて」. It is crucial to note that
  while "effective from" might imply a starting point in English, 「をもって」 primarily focuses on the **ending**
  or **completion** of something, or what has happened up until a specified end date. Therefore, it is
  generally **not** used to indicate a new beginning from a date that lacked prior significant events.

  - term: によって
    meaning: By means of, depending on, due to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「をもって」, 「によって」 indicates a cause, reason, or method in a broader sense and does not
      carry the same specific nuance of a definitive end date or a formal, instrumental means.
    grammar_point: によって・による・により (means・cause・dependency)
  - term: で
    meaning: At, in, by means of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「で」 is a general particle that can indicate the means or location of an action, but it lacks
      the formal nuance and specific end-date or declarative focus of 「をもって」. It is a much more versatile
      and common particle for everyday use.
    grammar_point: で (by means of・method)
  - term: から
    meaning: From, since, because
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「から」 primarily marks a starting point in time or origin, 「をもって」 (when used temporally)
      marks a definitive end point or a specific moment at which something concludes or becomes effective.
      They are almost opposites in their temporal marking.
    grammar_point: から (from)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「によって」, 「で」, and 「から」 can sometimes seem similar to 「をもって」, it's important
  to remember that 「をもって」 is primarily used in formal contexts to mark the end of something or to indicate
  the specific means by which something is achieved, often with a sense of finality or completeness. 「によって」
  focuses more on causation, dependence, or passive agents. 「で」 is a more general marker of location,
  time, or means without the elevated formality of 「をもって」. 「から」, in contrast, typically denotes a starting
  point or origin, making it distinct from 「をもって」's emphasis on conclusion.
examples:
  - english: As of the New Year, I have set new goals.
    japanese:
      - 新年 を {もっ て}、目標 を 新た に し まし た。
      - 新年 を {もっ て}、目標 を 新た に し た。
      - 新年 を {もち まし て}、目標 を 新た に いたし まし た。
    english_literally: Taking the New Year, I made goals anew.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新年 {で}、目標 を 新た に し まし た。
        english: I set new goals in the New Year.
        hint: 'While 「で」 could indicate the timing, 「をもって」 is chosen here to emphasize the New Year as
          a distinct, formal demarcation point for setting new goals, rather than just a general time.
          We''re looking for a formal ''as of'' meaning related to a time point or event, often with a
          sense of finality to a previous state or a new resolution starting from that point, which 「で」
          lacks here. To make it more clear, 「で」 expresses a general timing or location for an action
          to occur, while 「をもって」 establishes a definitive boundary or point from which something becomes
          effective or concludes. 「で」 indicates ''in/at'' that time/place, not ''as of'' that time/place
          in a formal sense. We''re looking for an ''as of'' meaning that marks a turning point or conclusion,
          which 「をもって」 provides. '
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新年 {から}、目標 を 新た に し まし た。
        english: From the New Year, I have set new goals.
        hint: 「から」 emphasizes the beginning point of an action or state. While grammatically correct,
          「をもって」 in this context signals a formal or decisive 'as of' point, often with a sense of finality
          to the previous state, which isn't conveyed by a simple starting point. 「から」 simply marks the
          start of an action or state. 「をもって」, when used temporally, emphasizes a point in time as the
          formal or official effective date of a change or the conclusion of something that existed previously.
          The nuance of 'decisively from this point' or 'as of this time' is stronger with 「をもって」. We're
          looking for a way to mark a definitive turning point, not just a simple start time.
    scene: A person reflecting on their personal resolutions at the start of a new year.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: This is a straightforward, common use of 「をもって」 to mark a definitive point in time from which
      something new begins or changes, often in a personal context. The casual register is evident in
      「しました」.
  - english: This project will conclude as of the end of this month.
    japanese:
      - 本 事業 は 本月 末日 を {もっ て} 終了 いたし ます。
      - 本 事業 は 本月 末日 を {もっ て} 終了 し ます。
      - 本 事業 は 本月 末日 を {もち まし て} 終了 いたし ます。

          - 本 事業 は 本月 末日 {で} 終了 し ます。
        english: This project will end by the end of this month.
        hint: 'In a formal business announcement, 「をもって」 lends a sense of officiality and finality to
          the termination date, making it more appropriate than the simple and less formal 「で」. 「で」 expresses
          a general time limit or location. In contrast, 「をもって」 emphasizes the specific time or event
          as a formal, definitive cut-off point or conclusion for something, often used in official pronouncements.
          We''re looking for a formal declaration of conclusion, which 「をもって」 provides. '
      - competing_japanese:
          - 本 事業 は 本月 末日 {から} 終了 し ます。
        english: This project will start concluding from the end of this month.
        hint: 「から」 indicates a starting point. Here, we need to mark the definitive end point of the project's
          operation. 「をもって」 emphasizes the finality of the action at that specific time. 「から」 marks the
          beginning of an action or state. 「をもって」, however, signifies a point in time as the official
          or absolute end of something, indicating that after this point, it will no longer continue.
          We're looking for a term that conveys a definitive end, not a beginning.
    scene: A project manager making a formal announcement about the project's termination to team members.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「いたします」 signals a formal and polite tone, characteristic of business or official communications.
      The use of 「をもって」 reinforces the formal nature of the announcement of a definitive end date.
  - english: Our store will be closing as of next Saturday.
    japanese:
      - 弊店 は 来週 土曜 日 を {もち まし て} 閉店 さ せ て いただき ます。
      - 弊店 は 来週 土曜 日 を {もち まし て} 閉店 いたし ます。
      - 弊店 は 来週 土曜 日 を {もっ て} 閉店 さ せ て いただき ます。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 弊店 は 来週 土曜 日 {で} 閉店 し ます。
        english: Our store will close on next Saturday.
        hint: 'As a formal announcement to a public, particularly one conveying unfortunate news, the
          highly polite 「をもちまして」 is chosen over the simpler 「で」 to show utmost respect and deference to
          the customers. 「させていただきます」 further enhances this. 「で」 simply states a time. 「をもって」 (or its more
          polite form 「をもちまして」) formally declares an event''s conclusion at a specific time, emphasizing
          the official nature of the cessation. We''re looking for a formal, polite way to announce a
          definitive closure, which 「をもって」 delivers. '
      - competing_japanese:
          - 弊店 は 来週 土曜 日 {から} 閉店 さ せ て いただき ます。
        english: 「から」 denotes a beginning or starting point. In this context, the store's closure is definitive
          at that date, not initiating a process from it. 「をもって」 conveys this definitive end point.
        hint: 「から」 denotes a beginning or starting point. In this context, the store's closure is definitive
          at that date, not initiating a process from it. 「をもって」 conveys this definitive end point. 「から」
          marks the start of an action or state. 「をもって」, in contrast, marks a point in time as the definitive
          end or conclusion of something, especially in formal announcements. We're looking for a phrase
          that expresses a final end, not a beginning.
    scene: A female store manager making a public announcement to her loyal customers about the permanent
      closure of the branch.
    register: formal
    setting: apologetic
    nuance: 「をもちまして」 is a highly polite form of 「をもって」, frequently used in formal business announcements
      to express regret or important information to a general audience. The combination with 「させていただきます」
      makes the statement incredibly deferential and humble, suitable for a manager announcing a store
      closure to customers.
  - english: With sincerity, he apologized to everyone involved.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 誠意 を {もっ て}、関係 者 全員 に 謝罪 し た。
      - 彼 は 誠意 を {もち まし て}、関係 者 全員 に 謝罪 いたし まし た。
      - 彼 は 誠意 を {もっ て}、関係 者 全員 に 謝罪 し ます。

          - 彼 は 誠意 {で}、関係 者 全員 に 謝罪 し た。
        english: He apologized to everyone involved with sincerity.
        hint: While 「で」 could imply 'by means of sincerity,' 「をもって」 emphasizes the abstract quality of
          sincerity as the definitive instrument or attribute employed for the apology, lending a more
          solemn and emphatic tone to the action. 「で」 indicates a general means. 「をもって」, however, emphasizes
          the abstract noun as a specific, intentional instrument or quality used to achieve the action,
          adding a formal and often more profound nuance. We're looking for a phrase that highlights the
          profound impact of the means used, which 「をもって」 does.
    scene: A man explaining to a third party how another person handled a difficult situation, emphasizing
      their genuine regret.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: This usage emphasizes the abstract quality of sincerity 「誠意」 as the direct means or tool by
      which the apology 「謝罪」 was performed. The formality of 「をもって」 reinforces the gravity of the situation
      and the depth of the apology.
  - english: With the above, I will conclude today's presentation.
    japanese:
      - 以上 を {もち まし て}、本日 の プレゼンテーション を 終了 いたし ます。
      - 以上 を {もっ て}、本日 の プレゼンテーション を 終了 いたし ます。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ {で}、本日 の プレゼンテーション を 終了 いたし ます。
        english: With this, I will conclude today's presentation.
        hint: 'In formal public speaking, 「をもって」 (or 「をもちまして」) is the standard and most appropriate phrase
          to mark a conclusion, conveying a sense of authority and finality that 「これで」, while grammatically
          correct, lacks in formality. 「これで」 is a casual or general way to say ''with this''. 「をもって」 (or
          「をもちまして」) is specifically used in formal contexts to make a definitive declaration of completion
          or cessation, carrying a weight of officiality. We''re looking for a formal, authoritative way
          to conclude, which 「をもって」 provides. '
    scene: A male speaker, possibly a CEO or senior manager, formally wrapping up a business presentation
      to a large audience.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: This is a fixed and highly formal closing phrase for presentations, meetings, or speeches.
      The use of 「をもちまして」 combined with 「終了いたします」 conveys a strong sense of official completion and professionalism,
      typically used by someone in a position of authority addressing a group.
  - english: By means of his words, the situation completely changed.
    japanese:
      - 彼 の 言葉 を {もっ て}、事態 は 一変 し た。
      - 彼 の 言葉 を {もち まし て}、事態 は 一変 いたし まし た。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 言葉 {で}、事態 は 一変 し た。
        english: The situation completely changed with his words.
        hint: While 「で」 could indicate the cause, 「をもって」 here emphasizes the words as the direct and potent
          instrument or vehicle through which the profound change occurred, lending a more dramatic and
          formal narrative quality. 「で」 indicates a general means or cause. 「をもって」, however, highlights
          the specific means as a direct, instrumental force causing the change, often adding a more decisive
          or impactful nuance in formal contexts. We're looking for a phrase that emphasizes the direct,
          powerful means of change, which 「をもって」 does.
    scene: A historian describing how a pivotal speech by a leader dramatically altered the course of
      events.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: This example highlights the instrumental use of 「をもって」, emphasizing 'his words' as the decisive
      means or tool that brought about a complete change. This usage is common in more analytical or descriptive
      contexts, such as historical accounts or literary analyses.
  - english: With that news, hope was shattered.
    japanese:
      - その 知らせ を {もて}、希望 が 打ち砕か れ た。
      - その 知らせ を {もっ て}、希望 が 打ち砕か れ た。
    english_literally: Taking that news, hope was shattered.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 知らせ {で}、希望 が 打ち砕か れ た。
        english: Hope was shattered by that news.
        hint: The archaic and literary 「をもて」 is used here to imbue the statement with a dramatic, almost
          poetic sense of irreversible finality and profound impact, far beyond the factual report of
          a simple 「で」. 「で」 states a general cause. 「をもて」, an archaic variant of 「をもって」, strongly emphasizes
          the means as the direct and potent instrument of a severe or impactful outcome, conveying a
          heightened sense of drama and finality, often seen in literary contexts. We're looking for a
          phrase with strong dramatic emphasis on the means, which 「をもて」 provides.
    scene: A character in a classical drama receiving devastating news that irrevocably ends their aspirations.
    register: bungo (literary)
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: 「をもて」 is a rare, more classical or literary variant of 「をもって」. Its use imparts a strong sense
      of drama and finality, often found in older texts or highly stylized modern narratives to describe
      an event or piece of information as the direct and unavoidable instrument of a drastic outcome.
  - english: With extraordinary effort, she seized success.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 人 並み 外れ た 努力 を {もっ て}、成功 を 掴ん だ。
      - 彼女 は 人 並み 外れ た 努力 を {もち まし て}、成功 を 掴み まし た。
    english_literally: She, taking extraordinary effort, grasped success.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 人 並み 外れ た 努力 {で}、成功 を 掴ん だ。
        english: She seized success with extraordinary effort.
        hint: While 「で」 could express the means, 「をもって」 here elevates the 'extraordinary effort' to a
          definitive, intentional method or quality by which success was achieved, adding a tone of admiration
          and recognition of a profound cause-and-effect. 「で」 expresses a general means. 「をもって」 emphasizes
          the specific abstract quality (e.g., 'extraordinary effort') as the direct and powerful instrument
          used to achieve the outcome, often implying high regard for that means. We're looking for a
          phrase that conveys a high degree of respect for the means employed, which 「をもって」 does.
    scene: A female coach commending her female athlete's perseverance and ultimate achievement.
    register: formal
    setting: inspirational
    nuance: This usage of 「をもって」 emphasizes the 'extraordinary effort' 「人並み外れた努力」 as the direct and decisive
      means or instrument leading to success. It adds a more formal and respectful tone to the statement,
      highlighting the significance of the effort put in.
  - english: I will consider this matter closed as of this meeting.
    japanese:
      - 本 会議 を {もっ て}、本件 は 終了 と さ せ て いただき ます。
      - 本 会議 を {もち まし て}、本件 は 終了 と さ せ て いただき ます。
    english_literally: Taking this meeting, this matter will be concluded (humbly).
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 本 会議 {で}、本件 は 終了 と さ せ て いただき ます。
        english: This matter will be concluded at this meeting.
        hint: 「をもって」 provides a more formal and definitive declaration of closure at a specific point
          in time, such as a meeting, giving a sense of finality that the more general 「で」 does not. 「で」
          indicates a general time or place. 「をもって」 formally designates a specific event (like a meeting)
          as the definitive point at which something (like a matter) is concluded, emphasizing the official
          finality. We're looking for a formal, decisive declaration of closure, which 「をもって」 conveys.
    scene: A manager or team leader formally concluding a discussion or issue in a meeting.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The phrase 「をもって」 is particularly apt here to officially declare the end of a matter, reinforcing
      the authority and finality of the decision made during the meeting. The use of 「とさせていただきます」 further
      enhances the formality and humility of the speaker in making such a declaration.
  - english: By means of deep reflection, he found the answer.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 深い 考察 を {もっ て}、その 答え を 見つけ た。
      - 彼 は 深い 考察 を {もち まし て}、その 答え を 見つけ まし た。
    english_literally: He, taking deep reflection, found that answer.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 深い 考察 {で}、その 答え を 見つけ た。
        english: He found the answer with deep reflection.
        hint: While 「で」 indicates means, 「をもって」 emphasizes 'deep reflection' as the specific, instrumental
          method that directly led to finding the answer, giving it a more deliberate and formal tone
          suitable for intellectual processes. 「で」 indicates a general means. 「をもって」, however, highlights
          the specific abstract concept (e.g., 'deep reflection') as the direct and chosen instrument
          for achieving the outcome, implying a more deliberate and focused application of that method,
          often suitable for intellectual or analytical descriptions. We're looking for a phrase that
          emphasizes the precise and direct means to a intellectual discovery, which 「をもって」 provides.
    scene: A professor or researcher discussing a complex problem-solving process.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: This example showcases the instrumental use of 「をもって」, where 'deep reflection' 「深い考察」 is highlighted
      as the specific and decisive means by which the answer was found. It carries a more intellectual
      and precise nuance than general particles, making it suitable for academic or analytical contexts.
post_example_writeup: When using 「をもって」 with a date or time, remember that it focuses on the conclusion
  or end point rather than the starting point. For example, while you can say 「本日をもって閉店します」 (We are closing
  as of today), it would be unnatural to say something like 「明日をもって開店します」 to mean "We are opening tomorrow."
  For starting dates, other grammar is preferable. Additionally, 「をもって」 can denote the means by which
  something is achieved, particularly with abstract nouns.
