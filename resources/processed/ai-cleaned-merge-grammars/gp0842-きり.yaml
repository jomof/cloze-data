    "etymology": "The term 「きり」 comes from the verb 「切る (きる)」, meaning \"to cut.\" The nuance is that something has been \"cut off\" or limited to a certain extent.",
    "writeup": "The adverbial particle 「きり」 conveys that an action (A) was the \"first and last time.\" It is often translated as \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"since.\" 「きり」 originates from the verb 「切る (きる) 'to cut'.」\n\nWith verbs, 「きり」 primarily indicates that (A) was all that was needed for (B), often resulting in a lasting consequence or change of opinion. Typically, (A) happens only once, and 「きり」 can be interpreted as \"ever since.\"\n\nWith nouns or counters, 「きり」 expresses that something is limited to (A), meaning \"nothing more, nothing less.\" In other words, (A) is the only thing included in a specific situation/action.\n\n「っきり」 is a more casual form of 「きり」 with no significant change in nuance.",
