    "etymology": "The term 「きり」 comes from the verb 「切る (きる)」, meaning \"to cut.\" The nuance is that something has been \"cut off\" or limited to a certain extent.",
    "writeup": "The adverbial particle 「きり」 conveys that an action (A) was the \"first and last time\" something occurred, leading to a lasting consequence. It is often translated as \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"since.\" This usage implies a definitive cessation or limitation, akin to something being \"cut off,\" deriving from the verb 「切る (きる) 'to cut'.」\n\nWhen used with verbs, 「きり」 primarily signifies that a singular past action was sufficient or the last occurrence, resulting in a permanent state or a fixed point in time from which a condition has persisted. The event typically happens only once, and 「きり」 is best interpreted as \"ever since.\"\n\nApplied to nouns or counters, 「きり」 indicates a strict limitation, meaning \"nothing more, nothing less.\" It defines the exact scope or quantity of a situation or action, with the specified element being the sole inclusion.\n\nWhile 「きり」 functions broadly across various registers, its more casual counterpart, 「っきり」, offers a similar meaning without a significant shift in nuance, though it carries a stronger sense of informality.",

Similarly, 「ままに」 and 「たなり」 describe a state of remaining as is, lacking the 'single event and enduring consequence' aspect of 「きり」. 「〜てから」 and 「以来」 are temporal markers, but 「きり」 focuses on the finality of the initial event's impact. 「最後」 is simply 'the last', whereas 「きり」 emphasizes the *making* of something the last, a decisive cut-off. 「たった〜だけ」 quantifies a small amount, while 「きり」 focuses on the exactness of the limit.",
