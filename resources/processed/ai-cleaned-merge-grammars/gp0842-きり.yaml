    "etymology": "The term 「きり」 comes from the verb 「切る(きる)」 meaning \"to cut.\" The implication is that something is cut off or limited to a certain extent.",
    "writeup": "As an adverbial particle, 「きり」 may convey that upon action (A), that action was the 'first and last time'. This is frequently translated as 'only', 'just', or 'since'. 「きり」 comes from the verb 「切る(きる)」 'to cut'. 「きり」 is often used after the plain past form of verbs, with nouns, or with counters.\n\nWith verbs, 「きり」 is primarily used to show that (A) occurring was all that was required for (B). Usually, this results in some permanent consequence, or permanent change of opinion. In almost every situation, (A) is something that has only happened once, and 「きり」 can be interpreted as 'ever since'.\n\nWhen it comes to the use of 「きり」 with nouns or counters, it will express that something is happening with (A) as the limit 'nothing more, nothing less'. In other words, (A) is all that will be included in some particular situation/action.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   「きり」 may also be seen as 「っきり」 or 「キリ」. There is no specific change in nuance, but 「っきり」 is the most common casual form.",
