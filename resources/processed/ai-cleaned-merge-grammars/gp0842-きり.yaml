    "etymology": "The term 「きり」 comes from the verb 「切る (きる)」, meaning \"to cut.\" The nuance is that something has been \"cut off\" or limited to a certain extent.",
    "writeup": "The adverbial particle 「きり」 conveys that an action (A) was the \"first and last time\" something occurred, leading to a lasting consequence. It is often translated as \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"since.\" This usage implies a definitive cessation or limitation, akin to something being \"cut off,\" deriving from the verb 「切る (きる) 'to cut'.」\n\nWhen used with verbs, 「きり」 primarily signifies that a singular past action was sufficient or the last occurrence, resulting in a permanent state or a fixed point in time from which a condition has persisted. The event typically happens only once, and 「きり」 is best interpreted as \"ever since.\"\n\nApplied to nouns or counters, 「きり」 indicates a strict limitation, meaning \"nothing more, nothing less.\" It defines the exact scope or quantity of a situation or action, with the specified element being the sole inclusion.\n\nWhile 「きり」 functions broadly across various registers, its more casual counterpart, 「っきり」, offers a similar meaning without a significant shift in nuance, though it carries a stronger sense of informality.",
