    "etymology": "The term 「きり」 comes from the verb 「切る (きる)」, meaning \"to cut.\" The nuance is that something has been \"cut off\" or limited to a certain extent.",
    "writeup": "The adverbial particle 「きり」 conveys that an action (A) was the \"first and last time\" something occurred, leading to a lasting consequence. It is often translated as \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"since.\" This usage implies a definitive cessation or limitation, akin to something being \"cut off,\" deriving from the verb 「切る (きる) 'to cut'.」\n\nWhen used with verbs, 「きり」 primarily signifies that a singular past action was sufficient or the last occurrence, resulting in a permanent state or a fixed point in time from which a condition has persisted. The event typically happens only once, and 「きり」 is best interpreted as \"ever since.\"\n\nApplied to nouns or counters, 「きり」 indicates a strict limitation, meaning \"nothing more, nothing less.\" It defines the exact scope or quantity of a situation or action, with the specified element being the sole inclusion.\n\nWhile 「きり」 functions broadly across various registers, its more casual counterpart, 「っきり」, offers a similar meaning without a significant shift in nuance, though it carries a stronger sense of informality.",

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「だけしか」 is similar, but more emphatic about the limitation, often used to express a sense of insufficiency or dissatisfaction."

            "term": "しか〜ない",
            "meaning": "There's only, Nothing but",
            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「しか〜ない」 expresses the idea that there is nothing else, emphasizing a lack of alternatives and often conveying a negative nuance of 'only X, so it's not enough'."

        {
            "term": "だけ",
            "meaning": "Only, Just",
            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「だけ」 is a simpler and more neutral way to express \"only,\" without necessarily implying a lasting consequence or a strong sense of limitation/finality like 「きり」 can."

            "nuance": "Unlike 「きり」, 「ままに」 means 'as is' or 'while remaining' in a certain state, and does not necessarily imply a singular event leading to a lasting outcome; it focuses on the continuation of a state."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「きり」, which typically denotes a singular, definitive past action leading to a continuous state, 「たなり・なり」 describes a state of remaining or continuing without change, sometimes implying neglect or an unexpected outcome."

            "nuance": "「以来」 broadly means 'since' a certain time or event, marking a starting point for a subsequent period. In contrast, 「きり」 specifically implies a definitive, often singular, past event after which a state has persisted without further change, often with a sense of finality."

            "nuance": "「最後」 is a general term for 'the last' in a sequence. 「きり」, especially with demonstratives like 「これきり」, implies making a particular instance the definitive final one, often with a strong sense of cutting off or resolution."
        },
        {
            "term": "たった〜だけ",
            "meaning": "Only (a small amount)",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「たった〜だけ」 emphasizes the smallness or insufficiency of a quantity, suggesting it's less than desired or expected. 「きり」, however, stresses the absolute limit or singular nature of something, often without the implied negative judgment of insufficiency."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While terms like 「だけ」 and 「しか〜ない」 express limitation, 「きり」 adds a nuance of a single, definitive action or quantity, often implying a lasting consequence or an absolute cessation from that point. Similarly, 「ままに」 and 「たなり」 describe a state of remaining as is, lacking the 'single event and enduring consequence' aspect of 「きり」. 「〜てから」 and 「以来」 are temporal markers, but 「きり」 focuses on the finality of the initial event's impact. 「最後」 is simply 'the last', whereas 「きり」 emphasizes the *making* of something the last, a decisive cut-off. 「たった〜だけ」 quantifies a small amount, while 「きり」 focuses on the exactness of the limit.",
