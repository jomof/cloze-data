        "陸に + [negative verb/adjective]": "Indicates that something is not done well, properly, enough, or hardly at all."
    },
    "jlpt": "N2",
    "meaning": "Not well or properly, not much or enough, barely, hardly",

        "usage-context": "general"
    },
    "etymology": "The adverb 「陸に」 comes from the kanji 「陸」 meaning \"land.\" The reading 「ろく」 carries the nuance of flatness, correctness, or seriousness. In this grammar point, it implies a lack of thoroughness or correctness.",
    "writeup": "When the adverb 「陸に」 (roku ni) appears in a negative sentence, it indicates that something is not done satisfactorily, not enough, or not being done properly. It often appears at the beginning of the phrase, before the part of the sentence that includes a negative word, typically a verb in its potential form. 「陸に」 can be written in kanji, hiragana, or a combination of both. While you will often see it in kanji, it's common to see it in hiragana alone. The kanji used here is ateji (a kanji used purely for its pronunciation, not its meaning). This grammar point often carries a nuance of something being done without sufficient effort, or being half-baked. It emphasizes a lack of quality or completeness in the action or state being described. For example, 「陸に勉強しない」 (roku ni benkyou shinai) means \"to not study properly/enough,\" implying a lack of dedication or effort in studying.",

        {
            "japanese": "彼は最近、ストレスで夜も {ろくに} 眠れないらしい。",
            "english": "He seems to be so stressed lately that he can barely sleep at night.",
            "english_literally": "He recently, with stress, night also properly cannot sleep seems.",
            "scene": "A friend is sharing concerns with another mutual friend about someone they both know, explaining why he looks exhausted.",

                    "competing_grammar": "彼は最近、ストレスで夜もなかなか眠れないらしい。",
                    "mitigation": "The scene sets up a situation where the lack of sleep is impacting the person negatively, implying a problem with the *quality* or *sufficiency* of sleep, which 「ろくに」 conveys better than 「なかなか」 (which focuses on difficulty rather than adequacy)."

            "speaker_age": "younger",
            "nuance": "The phrase 「ろくに眠れない」 implies not just difficulty sleeping, but that the sleep obtained is of insufficient quality or quantity, suggesting a deeper problem. The use of 「らしい」 indicates the speaker is relaying something they heard or observed."

            "register": "formal",
            "setting": "serious",
            "nuance": "「ろくに計画されていない」 highlights a fundamental flaw in the planning process, indicating a lack of care or thoroughness, leading directly to the problems. This implies a more severe deficiency than simply 'not enough'."

                    "mitigation": "The coach's frustration points to the *quality* and *effectiveness* of practice being inadequate, not just the quantity. 「ろくに」 emphasizes the lack of *proper* effort or thoroughness that leads to poor outcomes."

The particle 「も」 further emphasizes that even a basic level of practice is lacking. This would be typical speech from an older, experienced male coach."
