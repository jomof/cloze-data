    "id": "gp0734",
    "meaning": "Not well or properly, not much or enough, barely, hardly",
    "pronunciation": {
        "katakana": "ロクニナイ",
        "romaji": "roku ni nai"
    },
    "formation": {
        "陸に + [negative verb/adjective]": "Indicates that something is not done well, properly, enough, or hardly at all."

    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "adverb",
        "usage-context": "general",
        "function": "Emphasizes a lack of quality, properness, or sufficiency in an action or state.",
        "nuance": "Strong emphasis on deficiency or incompleteness, often implying frustration or dissatisfaction."
    },
    "etymology": "The adverb 「陸に」 comes from the kanji 「陸」 meaning \"land.\" The reading 「ろく」 carries the nuance of flatness, correctness, or seriousness. In this grammar point, it implies a lack of thoroughness or correctness. While it uses the kanji 「陸」, it is ateji, meaning the kanji is used for its sound and not its original meaning in this context. This is a common historical linguistic development where kanji are repurposed phonetically.",
    "writeup": "When the adverb 「陸に」 (roku ni) appears in a negative sentence, it indicates that something is not done satisfactorily, not enough, or not being done properly. It often appears at the beginning of the phrase, before the part of the sentence that includes a negative word, typically a verb in its potential form. 「陸に」 can be written in kanji, hiragana, or a combination of both. While you will often see it in kanji, it's common to see it in hiragana alone. This grammar point often carries a nuance of something being done without sufficient effort, or being half-baked. It emphasizes a lack of quality or completeness in the action or state being described. For example, 「陸に勉強しない」 (roku ni benkyou shinai) means \"to not study properly/enough,\" implying a lack of dedication or effort in studying.",

            "term": "めったに〜ない",
            "meaning": "Hardly, rarely, seldom",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「陸に〜ない」, 「めったに〜ない」 focuses more on the frequency of an event rather than the quality or thoroughness of an action."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「陸に〜ない」 and 「めったに〜ない」 express infrequency, the key difference lies in their focus. 「陸に〜ない」 emphasizes that something isn't done well or properly, while 「めったに〜ない」 simply indicates that something rarely happens. For example, you'd use 「陸に」 when talking about someone who doesn't study *well*, and 「めったに」 when talking about someone who *rarely* studies. It's important to understand this distinction to convey the correct nuance.",

                    "hint": "「なかなか〜ない」 emphasizes difficulty in achieving something. We're looking for a state where something isn't done properly or sufficiently, not just that it's hard to do."

            "speaker_age": "younger",
            "nuance": "The phrase 「ろくに眠れない」 implies not just difficulty sleeping, but that the sleep obtained is of insufficient quality or quantity, suggesting a deeper problem. The use of 「らしい」 indicates the speaker is relaying something they heard or observed. The casual register is appropriate for sharing personal concerns with a friend."
