    "etymology": "「陸に」 comes from the kanji 陸 (land), and when read as 「ろく」, it carries the nuance of flatness, correctness, or seriousness, implying something insufficient or incomplete.",
    "writeup": "When 「陸に」 (roku ni), meaning \"satisfactorily,\" appears in a 「〜ない」 (nai) sentence, it indicates that something is not satisfactory, not enough, or not being done properly. This grammar pattern usually appears at the beginning of a phrase, before the main part of the sentence, which includes a 「〜ない」 word, often a verb in its potential form.\n\nWhile 「ろくに」 is often written in kanji, it is also common to see it in hiragana. Alternatively, 「碌に」 may sometimes be used, but this is ateji (using kanji for pronunciation rather than meaning).\n\nThis grammar point often has the nuance of something being done without sufficient effort or being half-baked.\n\nFun fact: 陸 comes from the kanji meaning \"land\" and is used with the reading of 「ろく」 when the nuance is flatness, correctness, or seriousness.",
