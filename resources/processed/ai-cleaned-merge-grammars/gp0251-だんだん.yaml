    },
    "etymology": "The word 「だんだん」 originally comes from the kanji construction 「段々」, which literally means 「step by step」 or 「stage by stage」. The repetition emphasizes the gradual nature of the change.",
    "writeup": "「だんだん」 is an adverb used to express a slight but constant progression of something. It signifies a change that occurs \"step by step\" or \"steadily.\" This adverb modifies the meaning of entire phrases, indicating a gradual increase or decrease in a state or action. To use 「だんだん」, simply place it before the phrase that describes the change. While 「だんだん」 can optionally take the particle 「と」 (e.g., だんだんと), it is very often omitted, a common characteristic for many adverbs and onomatopoeic words in Japanese. It is important to distinguish 「だんだん」 from 「どんどん」. While both describe progression, 「どんどん」 implies a rapid or forceful change, often carrying the nuance of a banging sound (like a drum). In contrast, 「だんだん」 emphasizes a slower, more deliberate, and continuous progression.",

        {
            "term": "どんどん",
            "meaning": "Progressively, rapidly increasing, more and more",
            "kind": "often confused with",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「だんだん」, 「どんどん」 expresses fast changes or progression. It has the onomatopoeic feel of drums, implying force or speed."
        },
        {
            "term": "少しずつ",
            "meaning": "Little by little, a bit at a time",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While both indicate gradual change, 「だんだん」 implies a continuous, unfolding process, whereas 「少しずつ」 suggests discrete, incremental steps or changes that are consciously measured."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The primary differences among 「だんだん」, 「どんどん」, and 「少しずつ」 lie in the speed and nature of change. Use 「だんだん」 for a continuous, steady, and often natural progression. Use 「どんどん」 when the change is rapid, forceful, or dramatic. 「少しずつ」 is used for incremental, deliberate changes, often implying conscious effort or measurement.",
