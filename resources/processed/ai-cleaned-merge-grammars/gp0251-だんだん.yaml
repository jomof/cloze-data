    "etymology": "The word 「だんだん」 originally comes from the kanji construction 「段々」, which literally means 「step by step」 or 「stage by stage」. The repetition emphasizes the gradual nature of the change.",
    "writeup": "「だんだん」 is an adverb used to express a slight but constant progression of something. It signifies a change that occurs \"step by step\" or \"steadily.\" This adverb modifies the meaning of entire phrases, indicating a gradual increase or decrease in a state or action. To use 「だんだん」, simply place it before the phrase that describes the change. While 「だんだん」 can optionally take the particle 「と」 (e.g., だんだんと), it is very often omitted, a common characteristic for many adverbs and onomatopoeic words in Japanese. It is important to distinguish 「だんだん」 from 「どんどん」. While both describe progression, 「どんどん」 implies a rapid or forceful change, often carrying the nuance of a banging sound (like a drum). In contrast, 「だんだん」 emphasizes a slower, more deliberate, and continuous progression.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene describes an internal, natural warming process, which 「だんだん」 conveys more smoothly as a continuous development, unlike 「少しずつ」 which can imply discrete, incremental changes."
