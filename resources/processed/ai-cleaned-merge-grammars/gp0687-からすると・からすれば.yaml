    "etymology": "This grammar point combines 「から」 (from), 「する」 (to do), and either 「と」 or 「ば」, which are hypothetical markers. The 「する」 here acts as a base for making a judgment, similar to saying \"going off\" something in English.",
    "writeup": "「からすると」 and 「からすれば」 are used to express a judgment or opinion based on a certain piece of information or situation. Think of it as saying \"judging from (A), (B)\" or \"considering (A), (B).\" 「する」 in this context indicates that (A) is the foundation for the speaker's assessment. It's often used with nouns, where (A) is the noun, and (B) is the speaker's opinion about (A).",
