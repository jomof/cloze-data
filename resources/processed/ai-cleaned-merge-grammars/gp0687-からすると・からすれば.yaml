        "usage-context": "General",
        "function": "Used to express a judgment or inference based on a specific piece of information, situation, or perspective.",
        "nuance": "Implies a logical conclusion drawn from the given information. The speaker is presenting their deduction or assessment, similar to 'going off' or 'based on' something."
    },
    "etymology": "This grammatical construction evolved from the combination of 「から」 (kara), meaning 'from' or 'since', and the verb 「する」 (suru), meaning 'to do', followed by hypothetical markers 「と」 (to) or 「ば」 (ba). In this context, 「する」 doesn't denote an action but rather functions to establish the preceding noun as the basis or source of the judgment or inference. It's akin to saying 'operating from' or 'proceeding from' a certain piece of information, leading to the derived meaning of 'judging from' or 'considering'.",
    "writeup": "The expressions 「からすると」 and 「からすれば」 are used to introduce a judgment, conclusion, or opinion that is derived from a specific piece of information, situation, or evidence. They can be translated as 'judging from', 'considering', or 'based on'. The structure is typically **[Noun] + からすると/からすれば**. The noun provides the foundation or the source from which the speaker makes their assessment or inference.\n\nWhile both 「からすると」 and 「からすれば」 convey a similar meaning, there can be subtle differences. 「からすれば」 sometimes implies a slightly stronger or more definitive conclusion, or a counterfactual 'if it were from this perspective'. 「からすると」 is often used for making a general judgment or prediction based on objective evidence.\n\nIn this construction, the verb 「する」, typically meaning 'to do', takes on a special role. It signifies that the speaker is forming a conclusion 'going with' or 'operating from' the assumption that the preceding noun (the basis) is true. This usage is conceptually similar to expressions like 'going off' or 'drawing from' in English, where the emphasis is on the origin of the judgment rather than an action being performed.\n\nThese phrases are versatile and can be applied in various contexts, from daily observations to more formal analyses, making them a common feature in everyday Japanese communication. They effectively communicate the logical link between an observation and the resulting conclusion.",
