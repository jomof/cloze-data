    "etymology": "The adverbial particle 「こそ」 is used for emphasis. It is followed by the realis (未然形 + ば/已然形) forms of the verbs 「する」 (to do), 「なる」 (to become), and 「ある」 (to be), which become 「こそすれ」, 「こそなれ」, and 「こそあれ」 respectively. These forms, while originating from classical Japanese verb conjugations, are used in modern Japanese specifically within this emphatic structure to highlight the preceding statement while strongly negating the following one.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「こそすれ〜ない」 is a sophisticated expression used to convey strong emphasis, asserting that while one thing is true or will happen, a specific contrasting or negative outcome certainly will not. It is predominantly used in formal contexts, including written Japanese, academic discourse, or serious conversations.\n\nThis pattern leverages the classical Japanese realis forms of certain verbs combined with the emphatic particle 「こそ」. The verbs involved are typically:\n\n*   **する (to do) → こそすれ**\n*   **なる (to become) → こそなれ**\n*   **ある (to be) → こそあれ**\n\n**Usage Notes:**\n\n*   **こそすれ**: This form can attach to the noun component of a する-verb (e.g., 勉強こそすれ) or the conjunctive form (連用形) of standard verbs (e.g., 食べこそすれ, though this specific usage is less common in this exact pattern, and often refers to the noun part of the verb phrase). It is commonly used when discussing actions or phenomena.\n*   **こそなれ**: Used when the preceding element is a noun or an adjective, indicating a state or condition. It emphasizes that something will develop into a positive state, but not a negative one.\n*   **こそあれ**: Primarily used with nouns, it acknowledges the existence of one quality or state while denying the presence of an associated negative one.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The phrase following 「こそすれ」, 「こそなれ」, or 「こそあれ」 will always contain a negative statement (indicated by 「〜ない」 or similar negation). This negation is what the speaker is often correcting or strongly denying as a misconception.\n*   Pay close attention to the verb stem in sentences, as auxiliary verbs like causative (〜させる) or passive (〜られる) can precede the 「こそする」 form. For example, 「感謝されこそすれ」 (to be thanked, certainly not...). You must discern the base verb and its modification.",
