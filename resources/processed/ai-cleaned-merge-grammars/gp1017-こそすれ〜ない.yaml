    "etymology": "The adverbial particle 「こそ」 is used for emphasis. It is followed by the realis form of the verbs 「する」 (to do), 「なる」 (to become), and 「ある」 (to be), which become 「こそすれ」, 「こそなれ」, and 「こそあれ」 respectively. These forms emphasize the preceding statement while negating the following one.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「こそすれ〜ない」 is used to emphasize that something will certainly not happen, but the opposite is true. It is a formal expression and is often used in written language or in serious conversations.\n\n*   「こそすれ」 can be attached to either the noun part of する-Verbs or the conjunctive form of standard verbs.\n*   「なれ」 and 「あれ」 are used based on the standard rules of what type of word 「なる」 and 「ある」 would usually appear with (a noun or adjective).\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   Be cautious as the base verb may have causative or passive auxiliary verbs attached to them before being altered with 「こそする」. You will need to identify the actual verb stem being used.\n*   The (B) phrase in this grammar point will include a negative statement, and is usually something that the speaker is responding to or correcting about what another person mistakenly thought.",
