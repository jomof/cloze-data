        "part-of-speech": "adverb",
        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "Used to inquire about the state, condition, manner, or method of something, or to propose a suggestion. While 'teineigo' is listed as the primary register for the grammar point's polite usage, 'どう' is highly versatile and is used across all registers depending on context and accompanying particles.",
        "nuance": "「どう」 is a fundamental interrogative adverb in Japanese, translating broadly to 'how' or 'in what way'. Its precise nuance varies significantly with context. It can inquire about general states or conditions, seek opinions or impressions, or propose ideas. The politeness level is often determined by the presence or absence of particles like 「ですか」 or 「だったか」, or the broader sentence structure. In casual speech, it can stand alone as a direct question about someone's opinion or situation.",
        "source": "dojg"
    },
    "etymology": "「どう」 originally comes from the word 「如何 (いかん)」, meaning \"in what way.\" Over time, 「如何」 was shortened phonetically to 「どう」 and became a common and less formal way to ask about conditions or methods. This linguistic evolution reflects a natural tendency towards simplification in everyday speech.",
    "writeup": "「どう」 is a fundamental interrogative adverb in Japanese, equivalent to \"how\" or \"in what way\" in English. It is incredibly versatile and can be used in a wide range of contexts to inquire about conditions, methods, opinions, or to make suggestions. The politeness level of 「どう」 is often determined by the particles and conjugations used with it. For instance, adding 「ですか」 makes it polite, while omitting it makes it casual. The even more polite and formal counterpart to 「どう」 is 「いかが」, which is typically used in more formal settings or when showing greater respect.",
