    "etymology": "The particle 「かい」 is a combination of the question particle 「か」 and the sentence-ending particle 「い」. The particle 「い」 is a masculine particle, similar to 「ね」 or 「よ」, and is considered quite rough.",
    "writeup": "The sentence-ending particle 「かい」 is used to form questions in Japanese. It's similar to 「か」, but much more casual and predominantly used by males. It's formed by combining 「か」 (the standard question particle) with 「い」, a masculine sentence-ending particle. 「かい」 is typically placed directly after the word or phrase it emphasizes. For verbs and い-adjectives, 「の」 can be inserted before 「かい」. For な-adjectives and nouns, 「なの」 can be inserted. However, 「の」 and 「なの」 are often omitted due to the casual nature of 「かい」. When they aren't omitted, 「の」 or 「なの」 can be shortened to 「ん」 or 「なん」, respectively, just like in the 「のです」 and 「なのです」 grammar structures.\n\nWhile there are exceptions, 「かい」 is generally used for simple yes/no questions.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\nBecause 「かい」 is very casual and direct, it can sometimes sound accusatory. Pay attention to your tone of voice to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nOutside of 「かい」, the sentence-ending particle 「い」 isn't commonly used in modern Japanese and appears only in a few specific structures (like 「だい」). Although it's similar to 「ね」, 「い」 is considered quite 「ぞんざい」 (\"rough\") and should only be used with close friends and never with superiors.",
