    "etymology": "The い in い-adjective comes from the inflectional ending that characterizes this type of adjective. The term 'predicate' comes from the grammatical role the adjective plays in the sentence, describing the subject.",
    "writeup": "A predicate is a word that describes the topic or subject of a sentence. In Japanese, this is called a 述語 (じゅつご), which literally means 'statement word.' As predicates, い-adjectives can appear by themselves (when the word they are describing does not need to be stated), or they may be used at the end of a sentence. When an い-adjective stands alone, it implies 'It is [adjective],' and the 'it' is understood from context. All い-adjectives are words of Japanese origin. In many sentences, either は or が can mark the word(s) the predicate describes. However, the choice depends on context. Generally, が is used to specifically point out something as being different from other items in the same category. For instance, when emphasizing a specific attribute, such as the unusual hotness of a bath, が would be used, whereas は would be less natural if that level of hotness is not its typical state. This grammatical nuance allows for precise expression regarding the subject's characteristics.",
