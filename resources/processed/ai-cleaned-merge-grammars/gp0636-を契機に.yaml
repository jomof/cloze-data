    "etymology": "The construction 「を契機に」 is derived from 「契機(けいき)」, meaning 'opportunity' or 'trigger'. The particle 「を」 marks the preceding noun as the object that leads to the subsequent event or change, and 「に」 indicates the result or consequence.",
    "writeup": "「を契機に」 is a formal pattern used to indicate that something served as a trigger or turning point, leading to a particular result. It can be translated as \"(A) led to (B),\" \"as an opportunity to (A), (B),\" or \"as a result of (A), (B).\" The event (A) can be positive or negative, but it usually involves a significant event in one's life or a major current/historical event. 「を契機に」 follows nouns or verbs nominalized with 「の」 or 「こと」. While 「にして」 or 「として」 can replace 「に」 without altering the meaning, it is important to note that, unlike 「をきっかけに」, 「を契機に」 is almost exclusively used in relation to a turning point or critical juncture. Using it to describe minor triggers can sound unnatural.",
