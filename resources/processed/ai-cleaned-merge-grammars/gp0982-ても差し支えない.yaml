    "etymology": "This grammar point originates from the combination of the conditional 'te-form' of a verb with the particle 『も』 (meaning 'even if'), followed by the negative form of the verb 『差し支える』 (さしつかえる), which means 'to interfere' or 'to hinder'. Thus, 『差し支えない』 literally means 'does not interfere' or 'is not a hindrance'. The phrase together forms a polite way to convey 'even if (X happens), it is not a hindrance', or 'you may (do X)'.",
    "writeup": "『ても差し支えない』 is a highly polite expression used in a manner similar to 『てもいい』 (may I) or \"do you mind?\" It is formed by combining the te-form of a verb (or でも for nouns and な-adjectives, and くても for い-adjectives) with the particle 『も』 (meaning 'even if'), followed by the negative form of the verb 『差し支える』 (さしつかえる). The literal meaning of 『差し支える』 is 'to interfere' or 'to hinder', so 『差し支えない』 means 'does not interfere' or 'is not a hindrance'.\n\nThis phrase can be used both for asking for and granting permission. Its literal translation is \"it is not a hindrance if (A).\" Due to its inherent politeness, the polite negative form 『ありません』 or the even more formal 『ございません』 is almost always used in place of 『ない』 by itself. When asking for permission, the interrogative particle 『か』 or 『でしょうか』 is often added to the end of 『ありません』 (e.g., 『〜ても差し支えありませんか？』).\n\nWhile 『ても差し支えない』 is consistently used in polite sentences, it is important to understand that the verb 『差し支える』 itself is not exclusively reserved for polite language. It can appear in various contexts to imply that one thing has or will have a negative impact on another, as seen in expressions like 『健康に差し支える』 (to hinder health). This dual usage highlights the nuanced meaning of the base verb and how it contributes to the overall polite expression.",
