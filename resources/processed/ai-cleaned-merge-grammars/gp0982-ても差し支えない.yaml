        "grammatical-role": "Conditional expression"
    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point originates from the combination of the conditional 'te-form' of a verb with the particle 『も』 (meaning 'even if'), followed by the negative form of the verb 『差し支える』 (さしつかえる), which means 'to interfere' or 'to hinder'. Thus, 『差し支えない』 literally means 'does not interfere' or 'is not a hindrance'. The phrase together forms a polite way to convey 'even if (X happens), it is not a hindrance', or 'you may (do X)'.",
    "writeup": "『ても差し支えない』 is a polite expression used similarly to 『てもいい』 (may I) or \"do you mind?\" It combines 『ても』 (or 『でも』 when following nouns or な-adjectives) with the negative form of the verb 『差し支える』 (to interfere, to hinder), resulting in 『差し支えない』. This phrase can be used both for asking for and granting permission.\n\nIts literal meaning is \"it is not a hindrance if (A).\" Due to its inherent politeness, the polite negative form 『ありません』 is almost always used in place of 『ない』 by itself. When asking for permission, the interrogative particle 『か』 is often added to the end of 『ありません』 (e.g., 『〜ても差し支えありませんか？』).\n\nWhile 『ても差し支えない』 is used in polite sentences, it is important to note that the verb 『差し支える』 itself is not exclusively reserved for polite language. It can appear in various contexts to imply that one thing has or will have a negative impact on another, as seen in examples like 『健康に差し支える』 (to hinder health).",
