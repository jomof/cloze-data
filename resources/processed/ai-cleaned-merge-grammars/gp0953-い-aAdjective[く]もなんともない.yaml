    "etymology": "The grammar point 「～くもなんともない」 combines the adverbial form of an い-adjective (～く), the particle 「も」 (which adds emphasis), and 「なんともない」, meaning \"it's nothing\" or \"not at all.\" The addition of 「も」 to 「なんともない」 amplifies the negation, creating a stronger sense of denial or lack of feeling.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「い-Adjective[く]もなんともない」 conveys a strong negation, meaning \"not at all,\" \"by no means,\" or \"nothing like that.\" It is formed by attaching the adverbial 「く」 form of an い-adjective to 「もなんともない」. For example, 痛い (painful) becomes 痛くもなんともない (not painful at all).\n\nThe phrase 「なんともない」 originally means \"it amounts to nothing\" or \"it's nothing significant.\" When combined with the emphatic particle 「も」, it intensifies this meaning, suggesting that the degree or quality described by the adjective is utterly absent or inconsequential.\n\nThis structure is particularly effective when the speaker wishes to dismiss a potential issue or sensation as entirely negligible. It implies that something which might ordinarily be a concern—such as pain, fear, or a perceived rarity—is, in fact, not present to any noticeable extent. Therefore, it is commonly used with adjectives that describe physical sensations or emotional states.\n\nAdditionally, it can be paired with the auxiliary adjective 「～たい」 (desiderative form) to express an absolute lack of desire, meaning \"to not want to do (something) at all.\" This emphasizes a complete aversion to an action. For instance, 行きたい (want to go) becomes 行きたくもなんともない (don't want to go at all).\n\nWhile this pattern can be used in various registers, it is often found in casual conversation due to its emphatic and sometimes dismissive nature.",
