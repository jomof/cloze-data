details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used to describe a situation where something occurred to an excessive degree, leading
    to an often negative or undesirable consequence.
  function: Indicates the cause of a state or action, specifically attributing it to an excessive condition.
  nuance: Emphasizes that the degree of the preceding action or state was so extreme that it inevitably
    led to the stated result. While the word 'あまり' itself is neutral, this grammar point often implies
    an undesirable outcome or a situation where the excessiveness caused difficulty.
etymology: The word 「余り (amari)」 itself means "remainder" or "surplus." The grammar point builds upon
  this by indicating that something has been done to excess, leading to a particular result. The nuance
  is that the 'remainder' of the thing after the action led to this outcome.
writeup: As a noun, 「あまり」 means "excess" and refers to an amount of something that is in surplus. This
  noun is often used after various words to indicate that something happened or exists to an excessive
  degree, resulting in something negative. While 「余り」 itself isn't inherently negative, this grammar point
  generally appears in negative situations.To use 「あまり」, attach it to the end of these structures:A verb
  (dictionary form)An い-adjective (turned into a noun using 「さ」 or 「み」) + 「の」A な-adjective + 「な」A noun
  + 「の」A phrase following 「あまり」 then highlights the negative result. The tense of the overall sentence
  depends on the first clause; therefore, the verb before 「あまり」 can appear in different tenses.

  - term: すぎる
    meaning: Too much, Very
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「あまり」, 「すぎる」 is directly attached to verbs or adjectives to indicate something is overdone.
      「食べすぎる」 means "to eat too much".
    grammar_point: すぎる (too much・excessive)
  - term: あまり〜ない
    meaning: Not very, Not much, Not really, Hardly
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「あまり〜ない」 means "not very" and is used to express a low degree or frequency. This is completely
      different from the 「あまり」 grammar point, which describes an excessive degree leading to a result.
      For example, 「あまり食べない」 means "I don't eat very much."
    grammar_point: あまり ない (not very or much)
  - term: なかなか
    meaning: While 「なかなか」 can mean "very" or "quite", it doesn't imply a negative consequence like 「あまり」.
      It also modifies the adjective directly or adverbially rather than forming a clause with a consequence.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「なかなか」 can mean "very" or "quite", it doesn't imply a negative consequence like 「あまり」.
      It also modifies the adjective directly or adverbially rather than forming a clause with a consequence.
    grammar_point: なかなか (quite not easily)
  - term: あまりに
    meaning: So much...that, (Way) too...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「あまりに」 is an adverb that can also mean "so much that", but its construction differs. 「あまりに」
      often directly modifies an adjective or adverb, whereas 「あまり」 requires a preceding verb or noun
      structure, leading to a specific clause.
    grammar_point: あまりに (excessively・too much)
  - term: こそ
    meaning: For sure, For certain, Even more so, Underlined or bolded text
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike 「あまり」, 「こそ」 emphasizes a preceding word or phrase and does not indicate excessiveness
      or a resulting negative consequence. For example, 「明日こそ」 means "Tomorrow for sure".
    grammar_point: こそ (emphasis)
  - term: からこそ
    meaning: Emphasized because, Precisely because
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「からこそ」 emphasizes the reason for something, highlighting its certainty or unique nature, whereas
      「あまり」 indicates an excessive quantity or degree leading to an (often negative) outcome. For example,
      「愛しているからこそ」 means "precisely because I love you."
    grammar_point: からこそ (precisely because)
  - term: 〜ので
    meaning: Because, So
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「〜ので」 simply indicates a cause or reason, without necessarily implying an excessive degree
      or a negative consequence. 「あまり」 specifically conveys that an action or state was so excessive that
      it led to a particular result.
    grammar_point: ので (reason)
  - term: 〜限りだ
    meaning: Extremely, Really, Very, As ... as one can be
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜限りだ」 expresses the utmost extent of a feeling or condition, often conveying a subjective
      impression. 「あまり」 describes an excessiveness of an action or state that objectively leads to a separate,
      often negative, consequence.
    grammar_point: Adjective + 限りだ (utmost degree)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「あまり」 describes an excessive degree leading
  to a consequence. Pay attention to the structures used with each expression; 「すぎる」 directly attaches
  to verbs and adjectives, 「あまりに」 is an adverb, and 「あまり〜ない」 expresses a lack of something, not an excess.
  「こそ」 and 「からこそ」は used for emphasis and reason, respectively. 「〜ので」 provides a general reason. 「〜限りだ」
  expresses the extent of a feeling.

post_example_writeup: The 「あまり」 grammar point emphasizes the **excessive degree** to which something occurs,
  leading to a particular result. The result is usually negative or undesirable, though the degree of
  negativity can vary from mild inconvenience to a serious consequence. Keep in mind that 「あまり」 requires
  a specific structure before it – a verb in dictionary form, an い-adjective converted to a noun, a な-adjective
  + 「な」, or a noun + 「の」. This differentiates it from other expressions of degree.
