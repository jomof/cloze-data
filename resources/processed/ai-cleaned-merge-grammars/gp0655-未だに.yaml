        "register": "semi-formal",
        "usage-context": "General",
        "function": "Emphasizes the continuation of a state or action for an unexpectedly long time, often implying surprise, frustration, or disbelief.",
        "nuance": "Carries a stronger implication of duration and often a more formal tone compared to まだ. It suggests that the current state has continued for much longer than anticipated or desired, emphasizing unexpected persistence.",
        "source": "resources/grammar/files/bunpro-fixed-yaml-all/create-bunpro-fixed-yaml-all-888",
        "logical-flow": "Used to express that a situation or state that was expected to have changed or ended by now continues to persist. It highlights a surprising or unexpected continuation.",

    },
    "etymology": "「未だに」 originates from 「未だ」 (mada), meaning \"still\" or \"not yet,\" combined with the particle 「に」 (ni). While 「未だ」 itself can mean \"still\" or \"not yet,\" adding 「に」 emphasizes the adverbial nature and often the surprising or persistent nature of the continued state.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「未だに」 is an adverbial expression conveying the meaning of \"still,\" \"not yet,\" or \"even now.\" It denotes a situation or state that has persisted for a surprisingly long time, often implying a sense of disbelief, frustration, or disappointment that things have not changed or progressed as expected.\n\nWhile sharing a similar core meaning with 「まだ」, 「未だに」 carries a stronger nuance of duration and often a more formal tone. Its usage suggests that the current state has continued for a much longer period than anticipated or desired, emphasizing the unexpected persistence. Think of it as conveying a sense of \"*still*, after all this time,\" or \"*even now*, it hasn't changed.\"\n\nThough both まだ and 未だ share the same kanji 未, 「未だに」 specifically uses this kanji in its written form, reinforcing its slightly more formal or emphatic register compared to the more common hiragana 「まだ」. It functions adverbially and typically appears at the beginning of a clause or sentence, modifying the verb or predicate.",

            "meaning": "still, not yet",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「未だに」, 「まだ」 is less formal and simply indicates that a state or action is ongoing or has not yet occurred, without necessarily implying a sense of surprise, frustration, or a particularly long duration. 「まだ」 is a neutral description, whereas 「未だに」 often carries an emotional or critical tone about the persistence of a situation."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When choosing between 「未だに」 and 「まだ」, consider the nuance you wish to convey. If the continuation of a state or action is unexpected, surprising, or has gone on for a notably long time, 「未だに」 is more appropriate. It implies a sense of lingering, often with an underlying feeling of disappointment or disbelief. If you simply mean 'still' or 'not yet' without such a strong emotional or temporal emphasis, 「まだ」 is the more common and natural choice. 「未だに」 explicitly highlights the unexpected persistence 'even now', whereas 「まだ」 is a simpler 'still' or 'not yet'.",
