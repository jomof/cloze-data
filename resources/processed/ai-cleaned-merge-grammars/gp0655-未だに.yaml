    "etymology": "「未だに」 originates from 「未だ」 (mada), meaning \"still\" or \"not yet,\" combined with the particle 「に」 (ni). While 「未だ」 itself can mean \"still\" or \"not yet,\" adding 「に」 emphasizes the adverbial nature and often the surprising or persistent nature of the continued state.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「未だに」 is an adverbial expression conveying the meaning of \"still,\" \"not yet,\" or \"even now.\" It denotes a situation or state that has persisted for a surprisingly long time, often implying a sense of disbelief, frustration, or disappointment that things have not changed or progressed as expected.\n\nWhile sharing a similar core meaning with 「まだ」, 「未だに」 carries a stronger nuance of duration and often a more formal tone. Its usage suggests that the current state has continued for a much longer period than anticipated or desired, emphasizing the unexpected persistence. Think of it as conveying a sense of \"*still*, after all this time,\" or \"*even now*, it hasn't changed.\"\n\nThough both まだ and 未だ share the same kanji 未, 「未だに」 specifically uses this kanji in its written form, reinforcing its slightly more formal or emphatic register compared to the more common hiragana 「まだ」. It functions adverbially and typically appears at the beginning of a clause or sentence, modifying the verb or predicate.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene implies a long-standing, widespread trend, emphasizing the surprising persistence of flip phones, which is better captured by 「未だに」 for its stronger nuance of duration and unexpectedness compared to the simpler 「まだ」."
