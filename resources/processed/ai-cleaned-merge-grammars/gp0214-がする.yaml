        "[Noun] + がする": "Indicates that something gives off a particular smell, sound, taste, or sensation.",
        "[Noun] + 気がする": "Indicates a feeling or sense that something is the case."
    },
    "etymology": "「が」 marks the subject (in this case, the sensation), and 「する」 means \"to do\" or \"to make.\" The phrase literally means \"[sensation] is doing/making.\"",
    "writeup": "「がする」 is used to describe sensory experiences like smells, sounds, tastes, and sensations (excluding visual perceptions). Instead of using specific verbs for each sense, 「がする」 focuses on the source of the sensation. The noun describing the sensation is followed by 「がする」.  \n\nFor example, instead of saying \"it smells like roses\" with a dedicated verb for smell, you'd say 「バラの匂いがする」, literally \"a rose smell is doing/making.\" This construction emphasizes the sensation itself as the subject.\n\nJapanese also often uses 「気」 (energy, spirit) to describe things perceived by the senses. Therefore, you might also encounter 「〜気がする」, which conveys a similar meaning to 「がする」, indicating a general feeling or sense about something.",
