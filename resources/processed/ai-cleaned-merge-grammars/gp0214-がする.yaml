    "etymology": "The grammar point 「がする」 combines the particle 「が」, which marks the subject, with the verb 「する」 (to do). In this context, 「する」 takes on a unique meaning, indicating the emanation or perception of a sensory experience, where the sensation itself is the subject. This highlights the non-volitional nature of the perception, emphasizing that the sensory input 'occurs' or 'happens' to the perceiver.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「がする」 is employed to articulate sensory experiences, specifically those perceived through senses other than sight. While the English language might use distinct verbs for each sense, such as \"to smell\" or \"to taste,\" Japanese frequently utilizes 「がする」 to convey the perception of a sensory phenomenon. This construction emphasizes that the sensory experience itself—the smell, sound, taste, or feeling—is the subject of the sentence, actively \"doing\" or \"occurring.\"\n\nFor instance, instead of directly stating \"I smell roses,\" one expresses that \"the smell of roses is occurring\" or \"a rose smell is being given off.\" This grammatical pattern is particularly useful for describing ambient or non-volitional perceptions. It differs from verbs that imply a conscious action of sensing, focusing instead on the emanation or presence of the sensory input.\n\nIt is also commonly seen in the form 「〜気がする」, which describes an intuitive feeling or impression. Here, 「気」 (energy, spirit, feeling) is treated as something that can be perceived or \"happen.\" This extends the usage beyond purely physical senses to include abstract feelings or premonitions.",

            "nuance": "While 「聞こえる」 also expresses audibility, it specifically refers to sounds being heard and is an intransitive verb emphasizing the ability to hear. 「音 が する」 focuses on the *occurrence* or *emanation* of a sound, emphasizing the sound itself as the subject. You would use 「聞こえる」 when talking about if a sound can be perceived by someone (e.g. \"Can you hear that sound?\")."

            "nuance": "「〜臭い」 is an adjective that directly describes something as being smelly, often with a negative connotation (e.g., 「汗臭い」 - sweaty smell, 「タバコ臭い」 - cigarette smell). In contrast, 「匂い が する」 neutrally describes the *presence* or *emanation* of a smell, without inherently implying a negative quality."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that 「がする」 is used for perceptions involving smell, sound, taste, and feeling. In contrast, 「に 見える」 is specifically reserved for visual appearances. If you wish to describe how something *looks*, use 「に 見える」. If you wish to describe how something *smells*, *sounds*, *tastes*, or *feels*, use 「がする」. For sounds, 「聞こえる」 focuses on the *ability* to hear, whereas 「音 が する」 emphasizes the sound *occurring*. When describing smells, 「〜臭い」 is an adjective for something being smelly, often with a negative nuance, while 「匂い が する」 is a neutral description of a smell's presence.",
