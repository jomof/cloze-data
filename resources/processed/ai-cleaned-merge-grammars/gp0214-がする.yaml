    "etymology": "The grammar point 「がする」 combines the particle 「が」, which marks the subject, with the verb 「する」 (to do). In this context, 「する」 takes on a unique meaning, indicating the emanation or perception of a sensory experience, where the sensation itself is the subject.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「がする」 is employed to articulate sensory experiences, specifically those perceived through senses other than sight. While the English language might use distinct verbs for each sense, such as \"to smell\" or \"to taste,\" Japanese frequently utilizes 「がする」 to convey the perception of a sensory phenomenon. This construction emphasizes that the sensory experience itself—the smell, sound, taste, or feeling—is the subject of the sentence, actively \"doing\" or \"occurring.\" For instance, instead of directly stating \"I smell roses,\" one expresses that \"the smell of roses is occurring\" or \"a rose smell is being given off.\"\n\nThis grammatical pattern is particularly useful for describing ambient or non-volitional perceptions. It differs from verbs that imply a conscious action of sensing, focusing instead on the emanation or presence of the sensory input. It is also commonly seen in the form 「〜気がする」, which describes an intuitive feeling or impression, considering 「気」 (energy, spirit) as something that can be perceived.",
