    "etymology": "The grammar point 「がする」 combines the particle 「が」, which marks the subject, with the verb 「する」 (to do). In this context, 「する」 takes on a unique meaning, indicating the emanation or perception of a sensory experience.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「がする」 is used to describe sensory experiences (excluding sight). It focuses on the *source* of a smell, sound, taste, or feeling. Instead of saying \"it smells like roses\" using a verb specific to smell, 「がする」 allows you to express \"the smell *of roses* is happening.\" 「気がする」 is related, as Japanese often considers 「気」 (energy, spirit) to be perceived by the senses.",
