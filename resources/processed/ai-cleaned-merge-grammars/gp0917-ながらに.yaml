    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ながらに」 is derived from 「ながら」, which means \"while\" or \"during.\" The addition of 「に」 emphasizes the continuous or unchanged state of something while another action is taking place or a condition exists. It adds a nuance of something being inherent or naturally occurring alongside another event or state.",
    "writeup": "「ながらに」 indicates that something remains in state A while B is happening or existing. It can be translated as \"while being (A), (B)\" or \"(A) as always (B).\" It follows nouns or verb stems. 「ながらに」 emphasizes that B is happening or existing in the same, unchanged state as A, though not necessarily at the same time. For example, 「生まれながらに」 means \"has existed since birth,\" indicating that B has been present since the state of birth, A. While there are many possible translations, the important aspect is the unchanged state. It's important to note that 「ながらに」 is used with a limited set of words. So, be sure to learn them as you encounter them.",
