    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ながらに」 combines the conjunctive particle 「ながら」, meaning \"while; during; as,\" with the case-marking particle 「に」. This combination emphasizes the continuous state or condition in which the action or state expressed in the main clause occurs. The 「に」 adds a nuance of inherent or unchanged state.",
    "writeup": "The 「ながらに」 grammar point indicates that something remains in a state (A), while also having or doing (B). It suggests that (B) is happening or existing in the same, unchanged state as (A). This doesn't necessarily mean at the same time, but rather that the conditions persist concurrently. It can be translated as \"while being (A), (B)\", or \"(A) as always (B)\". It attaches to nouns or verb stems, and the addition of 「して」 at the end of 「に」 doesn't change the meaning. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「ながらに」 tends to be used with a limited set of words, so it's best to stick to known structures. \n*   While \"burned alive\" is one translation, consider that 「生きながら」 literally means 「while alive」.",
