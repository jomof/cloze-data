etymology: The verb 「あげる」 originally meant "to raise" or "to lift up", reflected in the kanji 「上げる」. Its
  'giving' meaning derives from 'offering up' something away from the giver. The verb 「やる」 originally
  meant "to do", and over time acquired the nuance of giving or doing something for someone considered
  lower in status (pets, children, subordinates), and can also convey demonstrating ability or resolve.
writeup: |-
  「あげる」 and 「やる」 are two fundamental verbs in Japanese that can both mean "to give", but they carry distinct nuances and are used in different contexts. Additionally, 「やる」 has broader meanings extending beyond simply "to give".

  **あげる (to give, outward)**
  「あげる」 is primarily used for the act of giving something away from oneself to someone else. It implies that the item or information is being transferred from the giver's perspective, directed outwards. It is generally appropriate when giving to someone of equal or lower status, or to animals. It is crucial *not* to use 「あげる」 when something is given *to* the speaker or someone within their close in-group, as 「くれる」 would be used in such cases. The polite form 「あげます」 is very common in daily interactions.
  Historically, 「あげる」 originated from the meaning "to raise" or "to lift up", reflected in the kanji 「上げる」. The sense of 'giving' evolved from the idea of 'offering up' something to another.

  **やる (to do, give, send, show resolve)**
  「やる」 is a versatile verb with several core meanings:
  1.  **To do or perform**: This is its most fundamental meaning, similar to 「する」, and applies to actions, tasks, or activities.
  2.  **To give**: As a casual and often less polite equivalent of 「あげる」, 「やる」 is used when giving something to someone of lower status, such as pets, plants, or younger children. Using it for adults or superiors can sound condescending or rude.
  3.  **To send**: It can imply sending someone or something to a destination.

  When 「やる」 is attached to the て-form of another verb (Ｖて + やる), it functions as a subsidiary verb, adding specific nuances related to the speaker's action and attitude. In this form, it indicates one of two primary interpretations:
  *   **Performing an action for someone of lower status**: This usage suggests the speaker is doing something for someone they perceive as inferior or unable to do it themselves, often carrying a patronizing or forceful tone.
  *   **Expressing strong resolve or intent**: Here, 「Ｖて + やる」 conveys the speaker's unwavering determination to accomplish something, often against odds or to prove a point. It’s akin to saying "I will definitely do X" or "Just wait and see, I'll do X," implying a forceful intent to demonstrate ability or achieve a goal.

  In both subsidiary usages of 「Ｖて + やる」, there is an underlying sense of the speaker being in a position of power, superiority, or strong will over the outcome of the action. Historically, 「やる」 also meant "to do," and its current nuanced usages for giving and showing resolve developed over time.

  **Key Distinctions:**
  The primary distinction lies in perspective and social hierarchy. 「あげる」 focuses on the outward direction of giving from the giver's viewpoint to a non-in-group recipient. 「やる」 is more versatile; when used for giving, it highlights a clear status difference (giver superior to receiver). Its "to do" meanings range from general action to strong personal resolve, often carrying a more assertive or even aggressive tone than the neutral 「する」.
false_friends:
  - term: もらう
    meaning: To receive, to get, to obtain
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「あげる」, which focuses on the giver's action of giving away, 「もらう」 focuses on the recipient's
      perspective and describes the act of receiving something.
    grammar_point: もらう (to receive)
  - term: くれる
    meaning: To give (to me or my in-group)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「くれる」 is used when someone gives something to the speaker or to someone within the speaker's
      close in-group (e.g., family). 「あげる」 is used when the giver gives something away from their perspective,
      typically to someone outside their in-group, or when the speaker is the giver. 「やる」 is also outward-focused,
      but typically for lower-status recipients.
    grammar_point: くれる (to give, inward to me・in-group)
  - term: てあげる
    meaning: To do something for someone, as a favor for
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「てあげる」 indicates performing an action for someone as a favor, often implying that the action
      benefits the recipient. In contrast, 「あげる」 specifically refers to the act of giving an object or
      information, and 「Vてやる」 carries stronger nuances of condescension or personal resolve.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-て]あげる (to do for someone, outward)'
  - term: する
    meaning: To do, to make, to play (a game or sport)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「する」 is a general verb for "to do" without the specific nuances of status, giving to inferiors,
      sending, or strong resolve/condescension that 「やる」 can carry. 「やる」 often implies a more active,
      forceful, or deliberate engagement in the action, or a distinct power dynamic, whereas 「する」 is neutral
      in this regard.
    grammar_point: する (to do・make)
  - term: 差し上げる
    meaning: To give (humble form)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「差し上げる」 is the humble form of 「あげる」, used to show respect to the recipient. It implies an
      action done for a superior or honored person. 「あげる」 is a more general or neutral verb used for equals
      or inferiors, and 「やる」 is for distinctly lower status.
    grammar_point: 差し上げる (humbly give)
  - term: 行かせる
    meaning: To make someone go
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「やる」 can mean 'to send', 「行かせる」 (causative) specifically means 'to make someone go',
      emphasizing the causative aspect, possibly implying coercion. 「やる」 implies 'dispatching' or 'assigning'
      someone to go, emphasizing the sender's initiative rather than forcing the recipient.
    grammar_point: Verb[させる] (causative)
  - term: てみせる
    meaning: To show that one can do; to do something to prove a point
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both 「Vてやる」 and 「Vてみせる」 express strong intent. However, 「Vてやる」 often carries an aggressive,
      condescending, or defiant tone (especially when proving someone wrong from a position of superiority),
      while 「Verb[て]+みせる (to show one's determination)」 is more about demonstrating one's ability or determination
      to an audience, without the same negative power dynamic or confrontational nuance.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-て]みせる (to show one''s determination)'
  - term: やる
    meaning: To do something (knowing that it will cause someone trouble or difficulty)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While using the same verb 「やる」, this specific usage focuses on performing an action with the
      explicit awareness or intention that it will cause difficulty or trouble for someone else. In contrast,
      the current grammar point's direct uses of 「やる」 focus on giving to lower status, sending, or expressing
      the speaker's strong determination, not necessarily with a malicious or troublesome intent towards
      others.
    grammar_point: やる (to cause trouble)
  - term: てしまう
    meaning: To do something completely; to do by accident; to do regrettably/unfortunately
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「Vてやる」 expresses strong personal resolve or a condescending favor, 「Vてしまう」 indicates
      completion, accidental action, or regret. It focuses on the outcome or manner of an action rather
      than the doer's intent or power dynamic.
    grammar_point: Verb[てしまう・ちゃう・じゃう] (completion・regret)
post_false_friends_writeup: When differentiating between these expressions, particularly with 「あげる」, 「くれる」,
  「てあげる」, and the various nuances of 「やる」, it is crucial to consider the relationship and relative status
  between the giver/doer and the receiver. 「あげる」 is generally outward-focused for equals or inferiors
  (excluding the speaker's in-group). 「やる」, whether as a standalone verb for giving or in the 「Vてやる」 construction,
  consistently implies a power dynamic, whether it's a superior giving to an inferior, or a speaker asserting
  their strong will. In contrast, 「くれる」 is inward-focused (towards the speaker or their in-group), and
  「する」 is a purely neutral verb for performing an action. The phrase 「てみせる」 shares the 'strong intent'
  aspect of 「Vてやる」 but lacks the condescending or aggressive undertones, focusing more on demonstrating
  capability. Lastly, 「てしまう」 focuses on the outcome or manner of an action, such as completion, accident,
  or regret, which is distinct from the intentionality or power dynamics conveyed by 「Vてやる」.

      - 友達 に お 菓子 を {あげ ます}
      - 友達 に お 菓子 {あげる} ね
      - 友達 に お 菓子 を {あげよ う} と 思っ て いる
      - 友達 に お 菓子 を {あげ ちゃ う}
      - 友達 に お 菓子 {あげよ}
    english_literally: To friend, sweets, I will give.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 友達 が お 菓子 を {くれる}
        english: My friend gives me sweets.
        hint: 「くれる」 implies the sweets are given *to* the speaker or their in-group. We're looking for
          the speaker *giving* sweets.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 友達 に お 菓子 を {やる}
        english: I'll give my friend some sweets (more casual, potentially less polite for adults).
        hint: 「やる」 is a more casual or informal equivalent of あげる, but can sound less polite, especially
          when giving to people. We're looking for a general, friendly 'give'.
    scene: You are preparing a snack and decide to share it with a friend who is sitting nearby.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The use of the plain form 「あげる」 is common in casual conversation among friends. Adding 「ね」,
      as in 「あげるね」, softens the statement and seeks implicit agreement, a nuance often used by female
      speakers. The polite form 「あげます」 is also natural here for a slightly more formal but still friendly
      tone.
  - english: I will ask the teacher a question.
    japanese:
      - 先生 に 質問 を {あげ ます}
      - 先生 に 質問 を {あげる}

      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 が 質問 を {くれ ます}
        english: The teacher gives me a question.

          *giving* a question to the teacher.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 に {質問 し ます}
        english: I will ask the teacher a question.
        hint: 「質問します」 is the direct and common way to say 'ask a question'. While あげる is also correct
          here, it implies 'offering' a question.
    scene: A student is speaking to another student about their plan to ask a question to their teacher
      after class.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: academic
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: Using 「あげます」 for 'giving a question' is a polite way of saying 'asking a question', especially
      when speaking to a teacher. The polite form 「あげます」 reflects respect for the teacher's status. The
      humble form 「差し上げます」 is even more respectful and common in formal settings, while the plain form
      「あげる」 could be used when speaking casually to a peer about the teacher.

          - 妹 が 新しい ゲーム を {くれ た}
        english: My younger sister gave me a new game.
        hint: 「くれた」 implies the sister is giving *to* the speaker. We're looking for the speaker *giving*
          to the sister.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 妹 に 新しい ゲーム を {やっ た}
        english: I gave my younger sister a new game (more casual/less polite).
        hint: 「やる」 is a more casual verb for giving, often used for animals or people of lower status.
          While technically possible, あげる is generally more neutral and widely accepted even in casual
          contexts.
    scene: A young man is talking to his older brother about a present he gave to their younger sister
      for her birthday.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The plain past form 「あげた」 is typical for casual conversations among family members or close
      friends. A younger male speaker might use this with an older brother. The polite form 「あげました」 could
      also be used to show a subtle degree of formality or carefulness. While 「やってあげた」 is also casual,
      it can carry a nuance of condescension or doing a favor, which might not always be intended.
  - english: I won't give her any more presents.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 に は もう プレゼント を {くれ ない}
        english: She won't give me any more presents.

      - competing_japanese:
          - もう プレゼント を {渡さ ない}
        english: I won't hand over presents anymore.
        hint: 「渡す」 is a neutral verb meaning "to hand over" or "to pass," without the directionality implied
          by あげる. We're looking for the act of *giving* away.
    scene: A man is expressing his frustration to a friend about a recent breakup, stating his decision
      not to give his ex-girlfriend any more gifts.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The direct negative 「あげない」 conveys a firm decision, common in casual, yet serious, discussions
      about personal matters. The use of 「彼女 に は」 highlights the recipient of the refusal. The polite
      form 「あげません」 can be used for a slightly less blunt refusal. For male speakers, 「あげねぇ」 is a highly
      casual, somewhat rough, and emphatic masculine negative form.

    register: teineigo (polite)

    conjugation: volitional polite (～ましょう)
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The 「〜ましょう」 ending adds a polite suggestion for collective action. This phrasing is suitable
      for addressing a group, encouraging them to perform an act of charity. The plain volitional 「あげよう」
      would be used in a more casual setting among close peers, conveying a similar 'let's do this' sentiment
      but with less formality.

        english: When I finish reading this book, you can receive it.
        hint: The phrase 「あげて も いい です よ」 focuses on the speaker's permission to give the book away, not
          the listener's action of receiving.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 を 読み 終わっ たら、あなた が 持っ {て 行っ て} も いい です よ
        english: When I finish reading this book, you can take it.
        hint: This suggests taking rather than having something given to you. We're looking for an example
          that specifically uses あげる.

      reading it.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: The combination of the te-form with 「～もいいです」 indicates permission. The use of 「あなた に」 and
      the polite 「です よ」 makes the offer friendly and clear, emphasizing the speaker's act of giving. The
      more casual 「～もいい よ」 can be used with close friends or colleagues where a slightly less formal tone
      is acceptable, while still conveying the same permission.

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - もし 不要 な もの が あれ ば、誰 か が {くれ たら} どう です か
        english: If you have unnecessary things, how about someone giving it to you?
        hint: The suggestion is for the child to initiate the giving action, not for someone to give something
          to the child.
      - competing_japanese:
          - もし 不要 な もの が あれ ば、誰 か に {売っ たら} どう です か
        english: If you have anything you don't need, how about selling it to someone?
        hint: This suggests selling rather than giving. We're looking for an example that specifically
          asks about giving.
    scene: A mother is advising her child to declutter their room and suggests donating unused items.
    register: casual
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: conditional (～たら)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The conditional 「あげたら どう です か」 is a common way to offer a suggestion. The casual tone and
      direct addressing of the child are typical of a mother's advice. 「あげたら いかが です か」 offers a more formal
      and polite phrasing of the same suggestion, suitable for a more distant relationship or formal context.
      「あげたら どう？」 is an even more casual variant, common among close family or friends.
  - english: I intend to give her a wristwatch.
    japanese:
      - 私 は 彼女 に 腕 時計 を {あげる} つもり だ
      - 私 は 彼女 に 腕 時計 を {あげる} つもり です
      - 彼女 に 腕 時計 を {あげる} つもり だ
      - 彼女 に 腕 時計 を {あげよ う} と 思っ て いる
      - 彼女 に 腕 時計 を {あげ たく て}
      - 絶対 彼女 に 腕 時計 {あげる}
    english_literally: I, to her, wristwatch, intend to give.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 彼女 に 腕 時計 を {くれる} つもり だ
        english: I intend for her to give me a wristwatch.
        hint: 「くれる」 implies she is giving something *to* the speaker. We're looking for the speaker giving
          something *to* her.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 彼女 に 腕 時計 を {もらう} つもり だ
        english: I intend to receive a wristwatch from her.
        hint: 「もらう」 implies receiving. We're looking for an intention to give.
    scene: A man is secretly planning a surprise gift for his girlfriend and confiding in a close friend.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「～つもり だ」 expresses intention. The casual 「あげる」 paired with this is appropriate
      for a man speaking candidly to a close friend about a personal plan. The polite form 「～つもり です」 maintains
      the intention but with increased formality. Omitting 「私 は」 is very common in natural Japanese when
      the subject is clear from context, making 「彼女 に 腕時計 を あげる つもり だ」 also a natural choice in a casual
      setting.
  - english: I will give a presentation on the new marketing strategy to the department head.
    japanese:

      - competing_japanese:
          - 部 長 に 新しい マーケティング 戦略 を {説明 し ます}
        english: I will explain the new marketing strategy to the department head.
        hint: 「説明します」 is a more general verb for 'explaining', lacking the specific nuance of 'offering'
          or 'submitting' implied by あげる for intangible things like presentations.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 部 長 が 新しい マーケティング 戦略 の 発表 を {くれ ます}
        english: The department head gives a presentation on the new marketing strategy to me.
        hint: 「くれます」 implies the department head is giving something *to* the speaker. We're looking for

    scene: A junior employee informing a colleague about their task for the upcoming meeting.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「あげます」 here, particularly for a presentation (発表) to a superior (部長), conveys the
      act of offering or submitting. It implies a sense of delivering something to a higher authority,
      which is a common usage of 「あげる」 in formal or business contexts, unlike simply 「説明します」 (explain)
      which lacks this directional nuance of offering.

        english: The mother is giving special consideration to her sick child.
        hint: 「している」 is a more general verb for 'doing' or 'giving', lacking the specific nuance of 'providing'
          or 'offering' implied by あげる for intangible things like care.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 病気 の 子供 は 母親 から 特別 な 配慮 を {もらっ て いる}

    scene: Describing a mother's dedication to her child's well-being.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「あげる」 can be used for abstract "gifts" like 「配慮」 (考慮) or 「愛情」 (愛情). The progressive form 「あげている」
      emphasizes the ongoing nature of the mother's care. This usage highlights the broad applicability
      of 「あげる」 beyond physical objects, extending to intangible contributions.
  - english: I can give you a ride to the station.
    japanese:
      - 駅 まで 送っ て {あげ られ ます} よ

      - 駅 まで 送っ て {あげ られ ない} か な

    english_literally: To station, sending, can give.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 駅 まで 送っ て {もらい ます} よ
        english: I will get a ride to the station.
        hint: 「もらいます」 means receiving a favor. We are looking for offering a favor.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 駅 まで {送り ます} よ
        english: I will send you to the station.
        hint: 「送ります」 is a neutral verb meaning 'to send' or 'to escort'. Adding 「あげられます」 implies doing
          it as a favor or benefit to the other person, which is the nuance we're aiming for.
    scene: A colleague offers to drive another colleague to the station after work.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: potential (～られる/～える)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The potential form 「あげられます」 (can give/do for) is used here to politely offer a service or
      favor. The phrase 「送ってあげる」 (to send [someone] as a favor) combined with the potential means 'can
      offer to send'. This shows thoughtfulness and willingness to assist.

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 率直 な 意見 を {言っ て} ください
        english: Please say your honest opinion.
        hint: 「言ってください」 is a common way to ask someone to state their opinion. However, 「あげて」 in this
          context implies 'offering' or 'providing' the opinion, suggesting a valuable contribution rather
          than simply stating it.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 率直 な 意見 を {聞か せ て} ください
        english: Please let me hear your honest opinion.
        hint: 「聞かせてください」 means 'please let me hear'. We are looking for a direct request for them to 'give'
          their opinion.
    scene: A project leader is asking team members for their feedback during a brainstorming session.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: Using 「あげて ください」 for 'giving an opinion' is a more indirect and polite way than simply 「言って
      ください」 (please say). It frames the opinion as something valuable being offered or provided, which
      is appropriate in a professional setting when seeking input. The use of 「ください」 makes it a direct,
      polite request.
  - english: I need to do my homework today.

        english: I need to do my homework today.
        hint: While 「する」 is a general verb for 'to do,' 「やる」 in this context emphasizes the act of getting
          something done, sometimes with a slight nuance of effort or commitment. We're looking for the
          more direct action.
    scene: A student talking to themselves about their daily tasks.

    scene: A mother reminding her child to feed their pet.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The use of 「やる」 for feeding a pet is natural and common, indicating the giver's higher status
      or responsibility over the animal. The casual 「だ よ」 further reinforces the familiar context.

        hint: 「行かせる」 (from 「使役 (causative)」) means 'to make someone go' and can imply coercion or forcing.
          We're looking for a verb that signifies sending someone for a purpose with the sender's initiative.
    scene: Parents discussing their child's future education.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「やる」 is used here in its sense of 'sending' someone, often to a distant place for a purpose.
      It implies the parents' decision and authority over their son's future. This usage is gender-neutral
      but often found in formal discussions among parents.

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 次 の 試験 は 絶対 に 満点 を {取る} ぞ。
        english: I'll definitely get a perfect score on the next exam!
        hint: While 「〜ぞ」 (from 「ぞ (strong emphasis)」) expresses strong assertion, 「〜てやる」 conveys an even
          more intense personal commitment, often with a sense of defiance or overcoming odds. We're looking
          for that strong resolve enchanted with a defying nature. This is a common way to express your
          strong resolve when showing someone your determination to overcome obstacles.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 次 の 試験 は 絶対 に 満点 を {取っ て みせる}。
        english: I'll definitely get a perfect score on the next exam and show you!
        hint: 「〜てみせる」 (from 「Verb[て]+みせる (to show one's determination)」) means 'to show that one can do
          something' or 'to prove a point.' While similar, 「〜てやる」 often adds a stronger, more defiant
          tone, suggesting overcoming obstacles or proving critics wrong. We're looking for that sense
          of forceful determination.
    scene: A determined student after a poor test result, vowing to improve.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The combination of 「絶対」 and 「〜てやる」 highlights an extremely strong personal resolve to achieve
      a goal. This is commonly used by people of any gender when expressing powerful determination, especially
      when proving something to themselves or others. The phrase implies the speaker's powerful will and
      defiance.
  - english: Fine, I'll do your work for you too, so don't worry.

        english: Okay, I'll do your work for you too, so don't worry.
        hint: While 「〜てあげる」 indicates doing a favor, 「〜てやる」, especially with terms like 「お前」, conveys
          a more condescending or superior attitude. We're looking for the phrasing that implies a hierarchical
          relationship and a less polite tone.
    scene: A senior colleague speaking to a junior colleague who is struggling and causing issues.
    register: casual
    setting: condescending
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「お前」 and 「やってやる」 by an older male speaker to a subordinate male listener clearly
      conveys a patronizing or condescending tone, as if they are doing them a great favor. 「やってやる」 here
      signifies doing a favor from a position of superiority. This casual register and direct address
      imply a familiar, yet hierarchical, relationship, typical of male-leaning speech in such contexts.
      The 「心配するな」 also adds to the commanding tone.

        hint: 「する」 is a general verb for 'to do,' but 「やる」 is often used more colloquially for playing

          engaged tone.

        english: No matter what they say, I won't give up on my dream!
        hint: 「諦めない」 simply means 'I won't give up.' Adding 「てやらない」 intensifies the refusal, expressing
          a defiant determination often aimed at overcoming external pressure or proving someone wrong.
          We need that strong, defiant nuance.
    scene: A determined artist speaking to herself after receiving criticism.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The use of 「諦めてやらない」 here conveys a powerful, defiant refusal to give up, suggesting a strong
      resolve against external opinions or difficulties. The phrase implies a deep conviction and determination.

          - よし、教え て {あげる} から、よく 聞き なさい。
        english: Alright, I'll teach you, so please listen well.
        hint: 「教え て あげる」 is a general way to say 'I'll teach you.' 「教え て やる」 is more direct and can sound
          condescending or imply the speaker is doing a favor from a position of authority. We're looking
          for the more assertive and potentially less polite tone.
    scene: An older manager instructing a younger, perhaps underperforming, subordinate.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The phrase 「教え て やる」 combined with the direct imperative 「聞け」 creates a condescending or commanding
      tone, characteristic of an older male in a position of authority addressing a subordinate. It implies
      doing a favor from a superior stance.
  - english: I'll manage the rest of the work.
    japanese:

        english: I will do the rest of the work (neutral).
        hint: 「する」 is a neutral verb for 'to do.' 「やる」 often implies a more active taking on of the task,
          showing initiative or capability. We're looking for the one that suggests taking charge.
    scene: A team leader reassuring a tired colleague during a busy period.
    register: semi-formal

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 中 に この レポート を {仕上げる}！
        english: I have to finish this report by tonight!
        hint: 「仕上げる」 is simply 'to finish.' Adding 「てやる」 to 「仕上げる」 conveys a strong, personal determination
          to complete the task, often implying a struggle or high effort. We need that sense of strong
          resolve.
    scene: A person working late, mentally pushing themselves to complete a task before a deadline.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The use of 「仕上げ て やる」 indicates a powerful internal monologue expressing extreme determination
      to accomplish a task, especially under pressure or when facing a challenge. It's a self-motivating
      phrase implying a strong will.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate the varied applications of 「あげる」 and 「やる」. 「あげる」 is seen
  in its primary role of outward giving, often with consideration for social status, while 「やる」 showcases
  its versatility from basic actions, giving to inferiors, sending, to expressing strong resolve or condescension.
  Observing the context and choice of accompanying vocabulary significantly impacts the perceived nuance
  of each verb. Understanding the subtle differences in perspective and social implications is key to
  using these verbs naturally in Japanese.
