    "etymology": "「必ずしも」is derived from 「必ず」 (kanarazu, meaning \"invariably\" or \"certainly\") combined with the particles 「し」 and 「も」. The combination 「し」 and 「も」 serves to strengthen the preceding word. Therefore, 「必ずしも」 literally implies \"absolutely certainly,\" but it is exclusively used in negative contexts to convey \"not absolutely certainly,\" which translates to \"not always,\" \"not entirely,\" or \"not necessarily.\"",
    "writeup": "「必ずしも」is an adverb that expresses that something is not always true, not entirely true, or not necessarily true. It's often placed at the beginning of a sentence or clause. While 「必ず」 means \"certainly,\" the addition of 「しも」 and the exclusive use in negative sentences gives 「必ずしも」 its nuanced meaning of \"not necessarily.\" Keep in mind that it **must** be followed by a negative predicate.",
