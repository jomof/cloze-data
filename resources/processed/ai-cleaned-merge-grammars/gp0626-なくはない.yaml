    "etymology": "This grammar point is a double negative, derived from the conjunctive form of 「ない」 (naku), followed by 「は」 (wa) and then 「ない」 (nai) again. It expresses a partial affirmation by negating a negation.",
    "writeup": "The phrase 「なくはない」 is used to express that something is 'slightly (A)', 'somewhat (A)', or 'in some respects (A)'. It comprises 「ない」 in its 「なく」 (conjunctive) form connected to either verbs or nouns, 「は」, and 「ない」. The literal meaning is close to 'it's not that it isn't (A)', and it functions as a type of double negative. Although mostly preceded by verbs, this structure sometimes appears following nouns. When following nouns, 「が」, 「は」, or sometimes even 「に」 may be placed between 「なくはない」 and the noun. Additionally, the 「は」 in 「なくはない」 is interchangeable with 「も」, slightly strengthening the nuance. This structure often appears with the potential form of verbs, to show that something is not impossible, despite appearances or what one may think.",
