pronunciation:
  katakana: テアル
  romaji: te aru
formation:
  Verb[て-form] + ある: Indicates that an action has been completed and its result remains, often implying
    a purposeful action by someone. The focus is on the resultant state of the object.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Used to describe the current state of an object that has been intentionally acted upon
    by someone, and the result of that action is still observable. The agent of the action is usually
    omitted or implicit. This structure focuses on the resultant state rather than the action itself or
    the actor.
  function: To express a resultant state of a purposeful action.
  nuance: Emphasizes that the state of something is due to a prior, purposeful action. For instance, if
    a window is open because someone opened it for a reason (e.g., to air out the room), you would use
    窓 が 開けてある. If it's just naturally open, you might use 窓 が 開いている.
  counterpoint: Verb[ている] (describes an ongoing action or a natural, spontaneous state) and Verb[ておく]
    (describes an action done in advance for a future purpose). Verb[てある] contrasts by focusing on the
    existing result of a past purposeful action, without necessarily implying a future use.
  colocation: Often used with objects that have been prepared, arranged, or altered for some reason (e.g.,
    準備してある - prepared, 飾ってある - displayed, 置いてある - placed).
  grammatical-role: Forms a compound predicate that describes the state of an inanimate object.
  logical-flow: Action (by agent) -> Resultant State (of object)
etymology: The てある construction combines the て form of a verb, which denotes sequential actions or a state,
  with ある, the verb meaning 'to exist' for inanimate objects. Historically, this combination evolved to
  express that an action has been performed and its result continues to 'exist' in a certain state. The
  purposeful nature often associated with てある comes from the nuance of an action having been 'set' or
  'placed' into existence, implying an agent, even if unstated. It's not just that something is in a state,
  but that it has been brought into that state by someone's will or effort.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point Verb[てある] describes a situation where an action has been completed, and as a result, the object of that action is now in a particular state. The key nuance here is that the action was performed **purposefully** by someone, even if that person is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. The focus is on the **resultant state** of the object, not on the action itself or the agent who performed it. Think of てある as signifying 'X has been done (and remains in that state).' This differs significantly from Verb[ている] and Verb[ておく].

  *   **Verb[てある] vs. Verb[ている] (Resultant State):** While both can describe a state, てある implies a *purposeful* action leading to that state. For example, 「窓 が 開けてある」 (Mado ga akete aru) means 'The window has been opened (by someone, for a reason), and is now open.' This contrasts with 「窓 が 開いている」 (Mado ga aite iru), which simply means 'The window is open.' The latter can be due to a natural occurrence (e.g., wind) or an accidental opening, without the emphasis on purpose.

  *   **Verb[てある] vs. Verb[ておく]:** ておく means 'to do something in advance' or 'to leave something as is.' The action is performed *for a future purpose*. For example, 「窓 を 開けておく」 (Mado o akete oku) means 'I will open the window (in advance, perhaps for ventilation later).' In contrast, てある describes the *current state* resulting from a past action, without necessarily implying a future use. It's about what *is*, not what *will be* prepared.

  てある is commonly used when describing arrangements, preparations, or things that have been intentionally set up. The subject of the sentence (which is the object of the action) is usually marked with が.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[ている]
    meaning: ongoing action or natural resultant state
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike Verb[てある], Verb[ている] can describe a state that occurred spontaneously or an ongoing
      action. For example, 「窓 が 開いている」 (The window is open) does not imply a purposeful opening. We're
      looking for a state resulting from a purposeful action.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-て]いる (ongoing state・habitual action・resultant state)'
  - term: Verb[ておく]
    meaning: to do something in advance or leave something as is
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While Verb[てある] describes a state that *is* as a result of a past action, Verb[ておく] describes
      an action performed *for a future purpose*. For example, 「窓 を 開けておく」 (I will open the window [for
      a future purpose]) focuses on the anticipatory action, not the current state. We're looking for
      the current result of a purposeful action.
    grammar_point: ておく (to do in advance)
  - term: Verb[た]
    meaning: simple past tense
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Verb[た] simply states that an action happened in the past. 「窓 を 開けた」 (I opened the window)
      focuses on the completion of the action. Verb[てある] emphasizes the *resultant state* of that action
      that still exists. We're looking for the ongoing state that resulted from a past action.
    grammar_point: Verb[た] (past tense)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the subtle distinctions between Verb[てある], Verb[ている], and Verb[ておく]
  is crucial. Remember, てある specifically highlights that an object is in a particular state *because*
  someone intentionally put it that way, and that state persists. ている describes any current state or ongoing
  action, whether intentional or not. ておく indicates an lenient action done with a future purpose in mind.
  Pay attention to the intent behind the action to correctly choose between these forms.

        english: 'The meeting room is cleaning. (Verbている: ongoing action); I cleaned the meeting room
          in advance. (Verbておく: action done in preparation)'
        hint: We're looking for a state resulting from a past, purposeful action, not an ongoing action
          or an action done for a future purpose.
    scene: You arrive at the office early and notice the meeting room is spotless.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)

      is still present. This implies that the cleaning was done for some reason, perhaps for an upcoming
      meeting.

        hint: We're looking for the result of a purposeful action, not an ongoing action performed by
          an inanimate object.
    scene: A teacher points to the whiteboard in the classroom.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: academic

      would simply mean 'it is closed' without specifying intent.

    register: casual
    setting: professional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)

      remain in that organized state. It's about the prepared state for easy retrieval.

          - 電気 が まだ 消え て い ない。
        english: 'The lights are still not out. (Verbている: natural state negation)'

          than just the lights not being off on their own.
    scene: Someone notices the lights are still on in an empty room late at night.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    nuance: 「消してない」 (a contraction of 「消してないある」) implies that someone was supposed to turn off the lights,
      but they haven't done so yet, and thus the lights are still on. It carries a slight nuance of an
      unfulfilled purposeful action.

        english: The instruction manual is not written in Japanese. (Passive voice, not focusing on purpose
          of state)

    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)

          on the action of wrapping them in advance.
    scene: You are talking to a friend about a recent party you both attended.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: 「包んであった」 confirms that the gifts were intentionally wrapped for the party. The past tense
      「あった」 indicates that this state existed at a specific point in the past. 「と 聞きました」 indicates hearsay,
      adding another layer to the statement.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, Verb[てある] is invaluable for describing situations
  where objects are in a particular state as a result of prior, intentional actions. It's often used for
  things that have been prepared, arranged, or altered. Mastering its distinction from Verb[ている] and Verb[ておく]
  will greatly enhance your ability to express precise nuances in Japanese.
