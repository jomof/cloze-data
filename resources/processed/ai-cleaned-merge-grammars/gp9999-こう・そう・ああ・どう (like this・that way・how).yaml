details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to describe or inquire about the way something is done or appears, relating to speaker/listener's
    proximity or shared knowledge.
  function: Specifies manner or state.
  nuance: 'こう: ''like this,'' referring to something shown by the speaker or a method known to the speaker.
    そう: ''like that,'' referring to something shown by the listener, already mentioned, or generally understood.
    ああ: ''like that,'' referring to something distant from both speaker and listener, or something recalled
    from the past. どう: ''how,'' an interrogative adverb asking for manner or method.'
  grammatical-role: Adverbial modifier.
etymology: These adverbs are part of the fundamental Japanese demonstrative series (こそあど言葉 kosoado kotoba),
  which includes こ- (ko-), そ- (so-), あ- (a-), and ど- (do-). Originally, these prefixes indicated spatial
  proximity (こ- near speaker, そ- near listener, あ- distant from both, ど- interrogative). Over time, their
  usage expanded from indicating physical location to also describing abstract concepts like manner, state,
  and shared knowledge. Thus, こう (derived from こ-) means 'in this way,' そう (derived from そ-) 'in that
  way' (near listener/understood), ああ (derived from あ-) 'in that way' (distant/recalled), and どう (derived
  from ど-) 'in what way?' This evolution from concrete spatial indicators to abstract manners reflects
  a natural linguistic development where physical concepts are extended to describe non-physical ones.
writeup: |-
  The words こう, そう, ああ, and どう are fundamental Japanese adverbs used to express the manner or state of something. They are often called 'demonstrative adverbs' because they derive from the same root as demonstrative pronouns (これ, それ, あれ, どれ) and demonstrative adjectives (こんな, そんな, あんな, どんな), carrying similar nuances of proximity and shared knowledge.

  *   **こう (Kou)** means 'like this' or 'in this way.' It is used when the manner or state is something the speaker is demonstrating, experiencing, or is clearly understood from the speaker's perspective. It can refer to an action the speaker is performing, a way the speaker wants something done, or a feeling the speaker has.
      *   Example: 「{こう} する の が いい です。」('It's good to do it like this.') (Speaker shows how)

  *   **そう (Sou)** means 'like that' or 'in that way.' It refers to a manner or state that is close to the listener, has been previously mentioned, or is generally understood by both parties. It is often used to confirm understanding or agree with something someone else has said or done.
      *   Example: 「{そう} です。」('That's right.' / 'That's how it is.') (Confirming what was said)

  *   **ああ (Aa)** also means 'like that' or 'in that way,' but it refers to a manner or state that is distant from both the speaker and the listener, or something recalled from memory or a past experience. It can convey a sense of realization or recollection.
      *   Example: 「{ああ}、あの 時 の こと です ね。」('Oh, you mean that time, don't you?') (Recalling a past event)

  *   **どう (Dou)** means 'how' or 'in what way.' It is an interrogative adverb used to ask about the manner, method, or state of something. It can be used to inquire about feelings, conditions, or ways of doing things.
      *   Example: 「{どう} しました か。」('What happened?' / 'How are you?') (Asking about condition)

  These adverbs are incredibly versatile and are essential for expressing nuanced meaning in Japanese. While they can be used across various registers, their politeness level often depends on the verb or ending they accompany (e.g., です/だ).

  - term: こんな・そんな・あんな・どんな
    meaning: such a ~, this/that kind of ~
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike こう・そう・ああ・どう, which are adverbs modifying verbs or adjectives, these are adjectives
      (連体詞 rentai-shi) that directly precede and modify nouns. For example, 「{こう} する」 (do it this way)
      vs. 「{こんな} 人」 (such a person).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:こんな・そんな・あんな・どんな (demonstrative adjectives)
  - term: このように・そのように・あのように・どのように
    meaning: in this way, in that way, how
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: These are adverbial phrases formed by adding the particle 「に」 to the demonstrative nouns このよう・そのよう・あのよう・どのような.
      While similar in meaning to こう・そう・ああ・どう, they are typically more formal or literary. こう・そう・ああ・どう
      are direct adverbs, often more casual and concise.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:よう (manner・state)
post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  It is important to distinguish these adverbs from similar-sounding demonstratives. 「こんな・そんな・あんな・どんな」 are adjectival forms that always modify a noun, as in 「こんな 本」 (this kind of book). In contrast, こう・そう・ああ・どう are adverbs that modify verbs, adjectives, or entire clauses. For example, you say 「こう 書く」 (write it this way), not 「こんな 書く」.

  Furthermore, expressions like 「このように・そのように・あのように・どのように」, while also meaning 'in this/that way,' are often more formal or descriptive. They are formed by combining the demonstrative nouns (このよう・そのよう・あのよう・どのような) with the particle 「に」, turning them into adverbial phrases. While they can often be used interchangeably with こう・そう・ああ・どう, the latter tend to be more concise and common in everyday speech.

post_example_writeup: Understanding the subtle differences in nuance and usage contexts for こう, そう, ああ,
  and どう is key to sounding natural in Japanese. Pay close attention to whether the speaker is demonstrating
  something, confirming shared knowledge, recalling a past event, or asking for information about a method
  or state. Practice using them with various verbs and in different conversational scenarios.
