jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  grammatical-role: Functions as a relative clause, modifying the following noun.
  spatial-flow: Describes physical or abstract possession relative to the modified noun.
etymology: The grammar point combines 「ある」 (aru), meaning "to exist" (for inanimate objects), with a noun.
  The 「が」 (ga) particle marks the subject of the verb 「ある」.
writeup: |-
  This grammatical pattern is used to modify a noun, indicating that it possesses something or is associated with something. The structure is "(A) がある (B)", meaning "(B) has / is equipped with (A)". This is known as a relative clause, functioning similarly to an adjective to describe the noun.

  Unlike English, Japanese does not require relative pronouns such as "who," "which," or "that"; the noun directly follows "がある."

  **Important Considerations**

  *   In a relative clause, the noun being described (B) is the main topic or subject. Therefore, 「は」 is generally not used in place of 「が」. However, 「の」 can sometimes be used instead of 「が」, as showing a relationship between (A) and (B) is one of the main functions of 「の」.
false_friends:
  - term: がある
    meaning: To exist; There is (for inanimate objects)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This refers to the simple existential meaning of 'aru' as a standalone verb. Unlike 'Noun(A)
      がある + Noun(B)', which modifies a noun to describe its possession or characteristic, the standalone
      'がある' indicates the existence of something, without modifying another noun, and does not serve as
      a relative clause.
    grammar_point: ある (to exist, inanimate・to have)
  - term: を持っている
    meaning: To possess, to have, to hold
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「がある + Noun」 which describes a characteristic or inherent feature, 「を持っている」 implies
      active ownership or holding, often by an animate being. While it can be used for inanimate objects,
      it emphasizes a more active state of 'holding' rather than an inherent quality. 「がある」 often sounds
      more natural for describing features of inanimate things.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:持っている (to possess, to have)
  - term: 〜付き
    meaning: Attached with, with (as a feature or accessory)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜付き」 is a suffix indicating that something comes with or has an attached feature or accessory.
      It's often used for things that are an addition or complement, rather than an inherent quality.
      For example, 「家具付き」 (furnished) means 'with furniture attached'. 「がある + Noun」 is broader and can
      describe any characteristic, inherent or otherwise, as long as it's a defining feature of the noun.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:〜付き (attached with)
post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  While the verb 「ある」 (aru) itself means "to exist" for inanimate objects, when 「がある」 directly precedes another noun, its function shifts dramatically. It no longer simply states existence but creates a modifying clause, describing the subsequent noun. This is crucial: the grammatical role changes from a main verb expressing existence to a descriptive clause within a larger sentence structure.

  Similarly, while 「を持っている」 also means "to have," it implies active possession, often by a living being, or a more direct holding. 「がある」, in this modifying context, describes a characteristic or inherent feature of the noun, making it more suitable for inanimate objects or qualities they inherently possess. Furthermore, 「〜付き」 implies an attachment or an included accessory. While it can convey a similar meaning, it's typically used for tangible additions, whereas 「がある」 is much more versatile for describing any kind of inherent characteristic or quality.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 庭 が {広い} 家
        english: A house where the garden is spacious.
        hint: The scene aims for describing the house by what it *has*, leading to a structure emphasizing
          possession, rather than simply focusing on the *width* of the garden using an adjective clause.
          We're looking for a description of what the house *has*.
    scene: A friend describing their dream house.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)

        hint: 「持っている」 typically refers to active possession by an animate being. While a vending machine

          a feature.

          - 冷たい 水 {付き} の 自動 販売 機。
        english: A vending machine with cold water attached.
        hint: 「〜付き」 is often used for an accessory or an included feature, like '家具付き' (furnished). While

          as a general feature.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: A vending machine that has cold water inside.

      for a polite inquiry and is gender-neutral.

          - 窓 {無し} の 部屋。

          of possession.

        hint: While this uses the plain past negative, the example requires a polite expression suitable
          for a complaint or polite recounting of an experience. We're looking for a polite negative past
          description of what the restaurant *didn't have*.

          - ベジタリアン メニュー を {持っ て い なかっ た} レストラン。
        english: A restaurant that was not holding vegetarian options.
        hint: 「持っていなかった」 implies active non-possession, which is less natural for describing a restaurant's
          offerings. We're looking for a polite, factual statement about the absence of a menu item.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ベジタリアン メニュー {無し} の レストラン。
        english: A restaurant without vegetarian options.
        hint: 「〜無し」 directly states the absence but 「がありませんでした」 provides a more natural and polite way
          to describe a facility's lacking feature in past polite tense.
    scene: A customer recounting a past dining experience to a friend or service staff.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: apologetic
    conjugation: negative past polite (～ませんでした)

      「ベジタリアン メニューが ありませんでした レストラン」 concisely explains why the restaurant was difficult to find by highlighting
      its lack of specific options. This phrasing is gender-neutral.

          - 強い メッセージ を {持っ て いる} 映画。
        english: A movie that is holding a strong message.
        hint: 「持っている」 is typically for active possession of tangible items. For an abstract concept like
          a 'message,' 「がある」 is more appropriate to indicate its presence or existence as a characteristic.
    scene: A film critic or student discussing the impact of certain films.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: This example uses the plain form 「ある」 in a general statement about movies. 「強い メッセージが ある 映画」
      emphasizes that the movie possesses or contains a strong message as a defining feature, which then
      leads to deeper thought. This phrasing is gender-neutral.

          - 素晴らしい 可能 性 を {持っ て いる} プロジェクト。
        english: A project that holds great potential.
        hint: 「持っている」 implies an active holding, which is less natural when discussing an abstract quality
          like potential. We're looking for a description of an inherent characteristic.
    scene: A manager discussing a new business venture with their team.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: This example uses 「がある」 with an abstract noun like 「可能性」 (potential) to describe an inherent
      quality of the 「プロジェクト」 (project). The phrase 「素晴らしい 可能 性が ある プロジェクト」 concisely conveys that the
      project possesses this significant attribute. This is suitable for a professional and informative
      setting, and the phrasing is gender-neutral.

        english: A person who holds a strong sense of justice.
        hint: 「持っている」 implies active possession. While technically understandable, 「がある」 is more natural
          for describing an inherent characteristic like a sense of justice.
    scene: A discussion among friends about admirable qualities in people.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: This example uses 「がある」 to describe an abstract, inherent quality of a person. The polite

      phrasing is gender-neutral.

  noun that comes before がある specifies what the following noun possesses or is characterized by. This
  flexibility allows for precise and descriptive language when discussing characteristics.
