    "etymology": "This grammar point is constructed from 「を」 (adverbial particle), 「禁じる」 (kinjiru - to prohibit, conjunctive form), and 「得ない」 (enai - cannot obtain, here meaning 'cannot help but'). Thus, literally, it means 'cannot prohibit [oneself] from.'",
    "writeup": "「を禁じ得ない」 is a formal grammar pattern used to express that one “cannot help feeling (A)”, or “cannot hold back from (A)”. It is primarily used with nouns that express emotions, or things that are the result of emotions, such as tears or laughter. This is a combination of the adverbial particle 「を」, the conjunctive form of the verb 「禁じる」 (to prohibit), and the 「得ない」 pattern which means “to not gain”, but is used similarly to 「できない」. 「を禁じ得ない」 will be seen following nouns, or occasionally verbs that have been nominalized with 「の」.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   This grammar pattern is almost exclusively used to express one’s own, first-person opinion. Due to this, it may sound unnatural if used to express others’ feelings.\n*   It is typically found in formal writing and speech.",
