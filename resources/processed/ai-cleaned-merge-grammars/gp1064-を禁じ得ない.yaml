        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "This pattern is typically found in formal writing and speech. It is almost exclusively used to express one’s own, first-person opinion or an observation where the speaker is deeply affected. Using it to express others’ feelings might sound unnatural."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「を禁じ得ない」 is formed from the particle 「を」, the conjunctive form of the verb 「禁じる」 (kinjiru, 'to prohibit' or 'to restrain'), and the auxiliary verb 「得ない」 (enai), which is the negative potential form of 「得る」 (eru, 'to get' or 'to obtain'). Literally, it means 'cannot obtain the ability to prohibit' or 'cannot manage to restrain.' This combination thus conveys the nuance of being unable to suppress an emotion or reaction, leading to the meaning 'cannot help but feel' or 'cannot hold back.'",
    "writeup": "「を禁じ得ない」 is a formal grammar pattern employed to convey that one is utterly unable to suppress a particular emotion or reaction. It is frequently translated as \"cannot help feeling (A)\" or \"cannot hold back from (A).\" This expression primarily connects with nouns that represent emotions or physical manifestations of emotions, such as 「涙」 (tears), 「怒り」 (anger), 「驚き」 (surprise), 「不安」 (anxiety), or 「喜び」 (joy).\n\n**Usage Nuances:**\n\n*   **Uncontrollability:** The core nuance is that the emotion or reaction is so overwhelming that it is beyond one's voluntary control. It implies an involuntary welling up of feeling.\n*   **First-person perspective:** While not strictly impossible for third-person, this pattern is predominantly used from a first-person perspective (or the collective 'we'). Applying it to describe someone else's feelings can sound somewhat presumptuous or unnatural, as it implies deep insight into their uncontrollable internal state. However, in narrative or formal contexts, it might be used to describe the unavoidable reaction of a group or general populace.\n*   **Formality:** This is a highly formal expression, commonly encountered in written language, academic texts, news reports, or very serious spoken discourse. It is not suitable for casual conversation.\n\nThis grammar point effectively conveys a profound, unavoidable emotional impact, distinguishing it from simpler expressions of feeling.",

Meanwhile, 「～てしまう」 is a more general and casual expression that can convey unintentional actions or the completion of an action, without the inherent formality and emphasis on uncontrollable emotion seen in 「を禁じ得ない」. Choose 「を禁じ得ない」 when expressing a deep, unavoidable emotional response in a formal context.",
