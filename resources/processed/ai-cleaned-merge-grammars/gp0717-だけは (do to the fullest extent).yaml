  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to emphasize the maximum extent of an action or state, often implying a contrasting
    or unexpected outcome.
  function: Indicates an action or state has been performed or achieved to its fullest extent, often with
    an implied contrast or limitation regarding the outcome or other aspects.
  nuance: Carries a nuance of 'only this much' or 'this was done, but...', emphasizing that while the
    action itself was completed to its maximum, the expected positive result might not have been achieved,
    or there were other limitations. The は particle adds a contrastive emphasis.
  grammatical-role: Functions as an adverbial phrase, modifying the subsequent verb.
  logical-flow: Presents an action as having been completed to its maximum capacity, then often contrasts
    this with a subsequent outcome that is less than ideal or unexpected. The effort is emphasized, but
    the result may be disappointing.
  temporal-flow: The action described with だけは is completed in the past or is ongoing, leading to a present
    or future outcome that is often negative or limited.
  spatial-flow: Not directly applicable, as this grammar point primarily deals with actions and results
    rather than spatial relationships.
etymology: The word 「だけ」 is said to originate from the verb 「具わる (sonawaru)」, meaning "to be fully equipped/provided".
  From this, it came to mean "the entire extent possible" or "all that one can". The particle 「は」 serves
  as a topic marker, emphasizing the aspect of "to the fullest extent possible" and often adding a contrastive
  nuance.
writeup: '「だけは」 is a grammar pattern that incorporates the particle だけ, meaning ''just'' or ''only'',
  combined with the topic particle は. In this specific structure, だけは indicates that a particular verbal
  action has been performed ''to the fullest extent possible'' or ''as much as one can''. Typically, the
  same verb is repeated both before and after だけは. The verb appearing after だけは usually takes its past-tense
  (〜た) or progressive (〜ている) form. For instance, if the verb is 食べる (to eat), 食べるだけは食べた translates to
  ''I ate just what I could eat'' or ''I ate to the fullest extent I was able to.'' As this pattern frequently
  discusses possibilities or capacities, the verb preceding だけは often appears in its potential form (〜れる
  / 〜られる). An important nuance: When used with a verbal noun (e.g., 勉強 ''study'', 連絡 ''contact'') that
  typically pairs with the verb する, the する can be omitted before だけは but must appear after it. For example,
  勉強 {だけは} したが (I studied as much as I could, but...) or 連絡 {だけは} しているが (I''ve contacted as much as I
  could, but...). In such cases, the verbal noun itself is not repeated after だけは. This construction places
  emphasis on the action itself, often setting up a contrast with a subsequent negative or less-than-ideal
  outcome.'

  - term: 〜限り
    meaning: as much as one can; as far as; as long as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike {だけは} which often carries a nuance of "doing *only* this much, or this much *despite*
      limitations/with contrasting results," 「〜限り」 more generally means "to the extent that..." or "as
      long as," without the strong implied contrast or sense of insufficiency.
    grammar_point: 限り (as long as)
  - term: 〜だけ
    meaning: only; just; as much/many as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「〜だけ」 expresses the limit or extent of something, it generally lacks the strong contrastive
      or concessive nuance that 「〜だけは」 conveys due to the presence of 「は」. 「〜だけは」 often implies that something
      was done to its fullest extent *but* with an unfulfilled expectation or a negative consequence,
      or that this was the *only* thing that could be done effectively. 「〜だけ」 is more neutral, simply
      stating the limit or quantity.
    grammar_point: だけ (only・just)
  - term: 〜のみ
    meaning: only; alone; solely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜のみ」 is a more formal or literary equivalent of 「〜だけ」, indicating exclusivity or singularity.
      Unlike 「〜だけは」, it does not typically carry the nuanced implication of 'doing one's best but with
      an unsatisfying outcome' or 'this is the only thing done'.
    grammar_point: のみ (only・just)
post_false_friends_writeup: While both 「〜だけは〜」 and 「〜限り」 are used to express the extent or limit of an
  action, their nuances differ. 「〜だけは〜」 often carries a sense of having done something to the maximum
  possible extent, yet with an implication that the expected outcome wasn't achieved, or that this was
  the only thing that could be done. In contrast, 「〜限り」 is generally more neutral, simply stating that
  an action is performed within a certain condition or limit. Understanding this distinction allows for
  more precise expression.

          action itself, subtly implying that this was the extent of the fulfillment, setting up the unfortunate
          reality of lacking play time. We're looking for a pattern that emphasizes the action was done

        english: I made it for the deadline, but I'm exhausted from staying up all night.
        hint: While '間に合わせたが' simply states meeting the deadline, {だけは} adds the nuance that this was
          the *only* thing achieved, often implying a struggle or bare minimum success, which is then
          contrasted with the extreme fatigue. We're looking for a pattern that emphasizes success achieved
          at a high cost.

          night.
        hint: 「〜限り」 focuses on doing something 'to the extent of one's ability' without the strong implied
          contrast or sense of insufficiency that {だけは} carries. We're looking for a pattern that emphasizes
          the action was completed, but with a negative consequence.

        english: Only making it for the deadline, but I'm exhausted from staying up all night.
        hint: 「〜のみ」 is more formal and implies exclusivity, not the sense of 'doing one's best but with
          an unsatisfying outcome' like {だけは}. We're looking for a pattern that suggests a partial achievement
          despite full effort.
    scene: A female student telling her classmate about completing a project right before the deadline.
    register: casual
    setting: cautious
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「間に合わせる {だけは} 間に合わせた」 implies that the speaker managed to meet the deadline, but
      only barely or at a high cost, which is then elaborated upon (徹夜で疲労困憊). A female speaker might use
      this to share a relatable struggle of academic pressure with a peer, highlighting the exhaustion
      despite fulfilling the requirement.

          their *absolute maximum* trust into the person, making the subsequent betrayal even more profound
          and impactful. We're looking for a pattern that highlights full commitment with a negative outcome.

    scene: A man confiding in his close friend about a painful past relationship.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The expression 「信じる {だけは} 信じた」 conveys that the speaker fully committed to trusting the person,
      suggesting a deep emotional investment. The immediate contrast with 「結果は裏切られた」 emphasizes the pain
      of betrayal despite the speaker's complete faith. A male speaker might use this in a somber tone
      to a trusted male friend when discussing heartbreak.
  - english: I learned as much as I could from past mistakes, but I still lack confidence.

          possible* from the failures, making the continued lack of confidence a surprising or frustrating
          contrast. We're looking for a pattern that emphasizes thorough effort with an unfulfilled outcome.

    scene: A woman discussing her personal growth journey with her therapist.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 「学ぶ {だけは} 学んだ」 indicates that the speaker thoroughly processed and learned from
      past mistakes, investing fully in self-reflection. However, the contrast with 「まだ自信がない」 highlights
      that intellectual understanding or past experience doesn't automatically translate to confidence.
      A female speaker might use this to express a nuanced psychological struggle to a therapist.
  - english: I prepared for the presentation as much as I could, but I got nervous and couldn't speak
      during the actual thing.

    scene: A student explaining their performance in a public speaking class to their professor.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「準備をする {だけは} したが」 emphasizes that the speaker put in maximum effort for preparation, demonstrating
      diligence. However, the subsequent consequence of nervousness and inability to speak creates a strong
      contrast. A male speaker might use this in a formal academic setting to convey a sincere apology
      or explanation to a male professor for a performance failure despite preparation.
post_example_writeup: The grammar pattern 「〜だけは〜」 typically indicates that an action was performed to
  its utmost extent, often accompanied by a nuance of contrast or limitation. This could mean that the
  outcome of the action was insufficient, disappointing, or that the action itself was the only thing
  that could be fully accomplished. It is frequently used when there is a discernible gap between the
  completion of an action and its subsequent circumstances or the speaker's feelings.
