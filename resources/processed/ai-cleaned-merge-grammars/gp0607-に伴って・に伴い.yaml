    "etymology": "The grammar point derives from the verb 伴う (tomonaう), meaning \"to accompany.\" The に (ni) particle indicates direction or purpose, and the use of the te-form (伴って) or the -i form (伴い) creates an adverbial phrase that describes the manner in which something occurs alongside something else.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「に伴って・に伴い」 expresses that something happens **along with** or **as a result of** something else. It emphasizes that two events or changes are closely linked or occur simultaneously. While it does not always indicate direct causation, there is usually a strong implication that the first event influences the second.\n\n「に伴って」 is used to describe both gradual changes that occur together and sudden events that trigger a change. It implies a close relationship where one action or state accompanies or results from another. It often carries a nuance of proportionality, where as the first thing changes, the second changes in a corresponding way.\n\n「に伴い」 is a more formal and literary variation, often used in written contexts such as news articles, official announcements, or academic papers. It can also function to modify a noun, as in 「に伴う（名詞）」, meaning \"(noun) associated with...\" or \"(noun) accompanying...\". This form highlights a inherent connection or a consequence that directly follows.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   This grammar point is often used when discussing social changes, technological advancements, natural phenomena, or personal developments, where one event or condition directly affects another.",
