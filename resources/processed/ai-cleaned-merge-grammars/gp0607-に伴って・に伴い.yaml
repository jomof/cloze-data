    "etymology": "The grammar point derives from the verb 伴う (tomonaう), meaning \"to accompany.\" The に (ni) particle indicates direction or purpose, and the use of the te-form (伴って) or the -i form (伴い) creates an adverbial phrase that describes the manner in which something occurs alongside something else.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「に伴って・に伴い」 (ni tomonatte / ni tomonai) expresses that something happens **along with** or **as a result of** something else. It emphasizes the idea that two events or changes are closely linked or occur simultaneously. While it does not always indicate direct causation, there is usually a strong implication that the first event influences the second. 「に伴う」 can also directly modify a noun. 「に伴って」 can describe both gradual changes and sudden events.",
