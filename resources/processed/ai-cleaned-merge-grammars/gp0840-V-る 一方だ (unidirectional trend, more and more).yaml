jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Describes ongoing trends, changes, or developments that are unidirectional. Often used
    to express concern about negative trends but can also describe positive ones.
  function: Expresses continuous, steady, and often accelerating change in a single direction.
  nuance: Emphasizes the uninterrupted and persistent nature of the change. It can convey a sense of inevitability
    or lack of reversal. When describing negative trends, it implies a worsening situation. When describing
    positive trends, it can imply steady improvement.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a predicate, describing the continuous progression of the subject's state
    or action.
  logical-flow: Indicates a cause-and-effect relationship where the cause leads to a continuous, single-direction
    effect.
etymology: The phrase combines 一方 (いっぽう), meaning "one side" or "one direction," with the copula だ, meaning
  "to be." Literally, it means "it is one direction," which has evolved to describe a situation where
  something is moving or changing continuously in a single, unchanging direction, without deviation or
  reversal. This emphasizes the singular trajectory of the observed trend.
writeup: |-
  「V-る 一方だ」 is a grammar pattern used to describe a continuous and uninterrupted trend where something is consistently increasing, decreasing, or changing in a single direction. It emphasizes the **unidirectional** nature of the progression, suggesting that there is no reversal or significant deviation from the observed trend.

  This pattern is frequently encountered in formal contexts such as news reports, academic papers, and official discussions, but it can also appear in more casual conversation when discussing noticeable trends. While it can describe both positive and negative developments, it often carries a nuance of concern or a sense of inevitability, particularly when used with negative trends. For example, describing pollution as 「増える一方だ」 (it's increasing continuously) implies a worrying situation.

  The verb preceding 「一方だ」 must be in its plain, non-past (dictionary) form. This construction highlights the ongoing nature of the change, rather than a completed action.

  - term: ますます (more and more)
    meaning: More and more; increasingly; to keep -ing (implying intensification)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ますます」 describes a progressive increase in degree or frequency. It's a general intensifying
      adverb and can apply to various situations. While similar to 「一方だ」 in indicating increase, 「一方だ」
      specifically points to a unidirectional, uninterrupted trend over time, often implying a less reversible
      process. 「ますます」 can be used with adjectives or verbs expressing various types of increase or decrease,
      while 「一方だ」 is typically used with verbs indicating change.
    grammar_point: ますます (more and more)
  - term: ばかりだ (only continues to)
    meaning: Only continue to, Keep on -ing, More and more
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ばかりだ」 shares a very similar meaning with 「一方だ」, both indicating a continuous, unidirectional
      trend. However, 「ばかりだ」 often has a stronger connotation of a negative or undesirable trend that
      is ongoing and often seen as problematic or out of control. While 「一方だ」 can be neutral or positive,
      「ばかりだ」 is almost exclusively used for negative developments.
    grammar_point: ばかりだ (only continues to)
  - term: ～ていく (to continue doing)
    meaning: To continue (doing something); to go on; to keep doing; to become (gradually)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜ていく」 indicates an action or state that continues into the future or moves away from the
      speaker/present point. It implies a progression. While it can describe a continuous trend, it lacks
      the strong "unidirectional, no-reversal" emphasis of 「一方だ」. 「一方だ」 implies an almost deterministic
      path, whereas 「〜ていく」 is more about forward movement.
    grammar_point: ～ていく (to continue doing)
  - term: なる・くなる (to become)
    meaning: To become (a noun or adjective)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「なる・くなる」 simply states that something has undergone a change and become something new or different.
      It describes the result of a change rather than the continuous process of an uninterrupted trend.
      While the result might be part of a larger trend, 「なる・くなる」 focuses on the transformation itself,
      not the relentless progression.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:なる・くなる (to become)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「ますます」「ばかりだ」「〜ていく」, and 「なる・くなる」 all relate to change or progression,
  「一方だ」 specifically highlights that a situation is moving in one continuous direction without turning
  back. 「ますます」 is a general intensifier for increases or decreases. 「ばかりだ」 is very close to 「一方だ」 but
  is almost exclusively used for negative trends. 「〜ていく」 describes continuation into the future or movement
  away. 「なる・くなる」 simply describes the act of becoming. Use 「一方だ」 when you want to strongly emphasize a
  persistent, single-direction trend.
