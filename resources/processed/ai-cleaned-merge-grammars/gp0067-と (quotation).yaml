    "etymology": "The particle と originally indicated co-occurrence or 'togetherness'. Its use as a quotation marker likely evolved from indicating that a speaker's words were 'together with' or directly representing the original statement. In essence, it marks the quoted content as being equivalent to what was originally said or thought.",
    "writeup": "The particle と functions as a quotation marker, indicating direct or indirect speech, thoughts, or references. In Japanese, this function is referred to as 引用 (in'you), meaning \"reference\" or \"citation\". と is placed after the quoted content and is typically followed by a verb such as 言う (iu - to say), 思う (omou - to think), 考える (kangaeru - to consider), or 聞く (kiku - to hear/ask). When quoting nouns or な-adjectives, include だ before と. At the end of a sentence, the verb following と is often omitted. Like other uses of と, this usage establishes the relationship between what is being communicated and how it is being communicated.",
