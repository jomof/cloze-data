    "etymology": "The particle 「と」 derives from the verb 「言う (いう)」, meaning \"to say\". Over time, it grammaticalized to function as a quotative particle, marking direct speech or thoughts.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「と」 serves as a quotation marker, indicating direct speech, thoughts, or written content. In Japanese, this function is called 「引用 (いんよう)」, meaning \"reference\" or \"citation\".  It follows the quoted content and is typically accompanied by a verb like 「言う (いう) - to say」, 「思う (おもう) - to think」, 「書く (かく) - to write」, 「聞く (きく) - to hear/ask」, or similar verbs that describe the act of quoting or referencing. At the end of a sentence, the verb may be omitted for brevity. This 「と」 simply expresses the relationship between the content of the quote and how it was communicated. Using kanji when possible in the 「japanese」 sentences helps to show that the word is not being quoted.",

            "register": "semi-formal",
            "setting": "informative",
            "etymology": "「聞きました」 is the polite past tense form of 「聞く」 (to hear), indicating that this information was received from someone else.",
            "nuance": "This sentence conveys information in a polite and indirect way, suitable for general conversation."

        {
            "japanese": "メモ に 「私 は 今 から 学校 に 行きます」 {と} 書いた。",

            "nuance": "The direct quote 「私 は 今 から 学校 に 行きます」 is precisely what was written, conveying the message verbatim."

            "speaker_gender": "female",
            "listener_gender": "male",
            "etymology": "「言った」 is the past tense form of 「言う」 (to say), indicating that the statement has already been made.",
            "nuance": "Using 「好きだよ」 is a casual way to express affection, and using it with 「と言った」 clearly indicates that these were the direct words spoken. The speaker's gender is indicated by the 「だよ」, which is typical for female speakers in this context. This is a very common way for girls to express feelings in japanese, and guys don't usually use it."
