        "particle-syntactic-function": "quotative",
        "usage-context": "general",
        "function": "Used to mark direct or indirect quotations of speech, thoughts, or written content.",
        "nuance": "Implies a direct or specific reference to the content that precedes it. Often contrasts with more casual or less direct reporting particles.",

        "grammatical-role": "Marks the object of verbs of saying, thinking, or writing."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「と」 derives from the verb 「言う (いう)」, meaning \"to say\". Over time, it grammaticalized to function as a quotative particle, marking direct speech or thoughts.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「と」 functions as a quotation marker, denoting direct speech, thoughts, or written content. This grammatical function is referred to as 「引用 (いんよう)」 in Japanese, which implies a \"reference\" or \"citation.\" It directly follows the content being quoted. \n\nAn important point to remember is that when the quoted content ends with a noun or a な-adjective, 「だ」 must be inserted before 「と」. For example, 「猫だ**と**言った」 (He said it's a cat) or 「静かだ**と**思った」 (I thought it was quiet). \n\nThis 「と」 is almost invariably followed by a verb that indicates the nature of the communication, such as 「言う (いう) - to say」, 「思う (おもう) - to think」, 「書く (かく) - to write」, or 「聞く (きく) - to hear/ask」. However, in certain contexts, particularly at the end of a sentence, the following verb may be omitted for brevity, with the implication remaining clear.\n\nUltimately, 「と」 in this capacity expresses the fundamental relationship between *what* was communicated and *how* it was conveyed.",
