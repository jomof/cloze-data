jlpt: N2
etymology: The particle 「も」 originally indicates 'also' or 'too.' When used in the 「も~も」 pattern, it emphasizes
  the presence or absence of both elements being described.
writeup: |-
  The 「も~も」 grammar pattern is used to express that two things are true or exist, or that neither of two things is true or exists. It creates a sense of balance or parallelism between the two elements. The pattern can be used with verbs, nouns, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives, each having a slightly different construction.

  *   **Verbs**: The ます-stem of the verb is followed by 「も」. For example, 「読みも書きもする」 (both read and write) or 「読みも書きもしない」 (neither read nor write). Variations using 「～し」 or conditional forms like 「～すれば」 can also be integrated, such as 「読みもするし、書きもする」 (reads and also writes).
  *   **Nouns**: The noun is directly followed by 「も」. For example, 「料理も掃除もする」 (both cook and clean) or 「料理も掃除もしない」 (neither cook nor clean).
  *   **い-adjectives**: The い ending is dropped and replaced with 「く」, followed by 「も」. For example, 「うれしくも悲しくもある」 (both happy and sad) or 「うれしくも悲しくもない」 (neither happy nor sad).
  *   **な-adjectives/Nouns**: Add 「で」 after the stem or noun, followed by 「も」. For example, 「便利でも経済的でもある」 (both convenient and economical) or 「便利でも経済的でもない」 (neither convenient nor economical). Similar to verbs, forms like 「便利でもあり、経済的でもある」 (is convenient and also economical) can be used.

  This pattern is versatile and adds nuance to your Japanese expressions, allowing you to convey a balanced or comprehensive perspective, emphasizing that the predicate applies equally to both mentioned items, either affirmatively or negatively.
false_friends:
  - term: し〜し (and; listing reasons)
    meaning: and; in addition; for such reasons
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「～し～し」 lists reasons or additional information, often implying there might be other
      reasons or items, 「も～も」 emphasizes the exhaustive inclusion or exclusion of *both* elements explicitly
      stated. It creates a stronger sense of parallelism and is often used for comparison or contrast
      where both items are equally affected by the predicate.
    grammar_point: し〜し (and; listing reasons)
  - term: 〜ばかりでなく・〜だけでなく (not only... but also)
    meaning: not only X but also Y
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～だけでなく～も」 primarily highlights the addition of something unexpected or more significant (Y)
      after mentioning something standard (X). In contrast, 「も～も」 treats both X and Y as equally weighted
      and simultaneously true or false, focusing on their parallel relationship rather than one being
      an extension of the other.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:〜だけでなく (not only... but also)
  - term: と (and)
    meaning: X and Y; X, Y, and Z (for listing items)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～と～と」 is a simple conjunctive particle used to list items exhaustively. It implies a direct
      conjunction. 「も～も」 adds the nuance of 'even' or 'also' to each item, emphasizing that the predicate
      applies equally to both, which can imply a comprehensive coverage or an unexpected pairing. It doesn't
      merely list, but makes a statement about the combined nature or state of the two elements.
    grammar_point: と (and, connects nouns)
  - term: '[Sentence] ばかりか (not only... but also)'
    meaning: Not only...but also; much more than; in addition to.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「も～も」 implies equal weighting or a comprehensive dual application, 「～ばかりか（～さえ）」 emphasizes
      that the second element (Y) is even more significant or surprising than the first (X). It conveys
      a sense of escalation or an "even X" implication, whereas 「も～も」 focuses on the parallelism of two
      items.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:〜だけでなく (not only... but also)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「も～も」, 「～し～し」, 「～だけでなく～も」, 「～ばかりか（～さえ）」, and 「～と～と」 can all connect
  ideas, their nuances differ. 「も～も」 stresses the complete inclusion or exclusion of *both* listed items,
  often highlighting a balance or comprehensive application. 「～し～し」 provides additional reasons or items,
  often implying a non-exhaustive list or simply connecting facts. 「～だけでなく～も」 emphasizes adding something
  significant or unexpected to the first item. 「～ばかりか（～さえ）」 takes this further by highlighting that the
  second item is even more surprising or extreme. Lastly, 「～と～と」 is a neutral conjunction for exhaustively
  listing items. Choose 「も～も」 when the parallelism and comprehensive application of the predicate to both
  elements are key, often in a balanced or dualistic sense.

        english: This week, I didn't watch TV, and I didn't read books either.
        hint: While 「～し～し」 lists reasons or items, 「も～も」 in the negative strongly conveys 'neither X nor
          Y' as a comprehensive statement of absence. We're looking for a pattern that emphasizes the
          complete lack of both activities.
    scene: A student is explaining their lack of free time to a concerned parent.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_age: younger

        hint: 「と～と」 simply lists the participants. 「も～も」 emphasizes that *both* groups, distinct as they
          are, equally enjoyed the movie, highlighting a more comprehensive inclusion. We're looking for
          a way to stress that both categories were included.
    scene: Two friends are chatting about a family-friendly movie they recently saw, surprised by its
      broad appeal.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The use of 「大人も子供も」 highlights the movie's universal appeal, showing that its enjoyment wasn't
      limited to a single age group but extended to both, emphasizing comprehensive participation.
post_example_writeup: The usage of 「も～も」 often emphasizes the exhaustive nature of what is being stated,
  whether it's an affirmation of both elements or a negation of both. Pay close attention to the verb
  or adjective form used after the second 「も」, as this dictates the overall tense and polarity of the
  statement. This pattern allows for a concise and impactful way to express duality.
