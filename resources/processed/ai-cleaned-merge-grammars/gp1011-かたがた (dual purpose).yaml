meaning: While doing X, also for the purpose of Y; To combine two purposes in one action
pronunciation:
  katakana: カタガタ
  romaji: katagata
formation:
  Noun or Verbal Noun (without する) + かたがた: Indicates performing an action for a primary purpose while
    simultaneously accomplishing a secondary, intended purpose.
jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: conjunction
  register: formal
  usage-context: Primarily used in writing and formal speech, especially when expressing apologies, gratitude,
    or official communications. It implies a dual purpose for an action, conveying that a secondary objective
    is accomplished alongside a primary one. It sounds unnatural if the linked actions lack a clear, intended
    dual purpose.
  function: Connects two actions or purposes, indicating that one action serves multiple intentions concurrently.
  nuance: Suggests a formal, often subtle, way of indicating multiple reasons for an action. The secondary
    purpose is not merely incidental but is a recognized, intended aspect of the action. It implies a
    polite and indirect way of achieving multiple goals.
  colocation: Often collocates with verbal nouns related to greetings, reports, thanks, or visits (e.g.,
    挨拶、報告、お礼、訪問).
  grammatical-role: Connects two clauses or phrases, with the first phrase (the noun/verbal noun) serving
    as the main context for the dual purpose.
etymology: The conjunction 「かたがた」 is derived from the word 「傍ら (かたわら)」, meaning "beside" or "while doing."
  The kanji 「傍」 itself signifies 'side' or 'beside.' This etymology reflects the core meaning of doing
  something 'alongside' or 'in addition to' another purpose. Over time, its usage evolved to formally
  express the accomplishment of two purposes simultaneously within a single action, where the second purpose
  is achieved incidentally or as a recognized, intended byproduct of the first.
writeup: '「かたがた」 is a formal conjunction primarily used in written Japanese or very polite spoken contexts.
  It is generally written in hiragana. It is used to express that an action is carried out with two purposes
  simultaneously: a stated primary purpose and a secondary, equally important or slightly less emphasized
  purpose that is also intended and achieved. The nuance is that the secondary purpose is not just a casual
  byproduct but a recognized, integral part of the action. This expression can be translated as "partly
  for the purpose of (A), and also (B)," "along with (A), (B)," or "incidentally to (A), (B)." While the
  English translations might suggest one purpose is merely incidental, in Japanese, 「かたがた」 implies that
  both purposes are significant and intended. 「かたがた」 attaches to nouns, especially verbal nouns (nouns
  that can take する to form a verb, like 挨拶 (あいさつ) or 報告 (ほうこく)). When attaching to a verbal noun, the
  する is omitted. This grammar point is highly formal and is commonly encountered in business communications,
  formal letters, or situations requiring a respectful tone, such as expressing apologies or gratitude.
  Using 「かたがた」 in casual conversation or when the dual purposes are not genuinely significant can sound
  unnatural or overly stiff. Therefore, it is important to reserve its use for appropriate formal contexts
  where such nuance is valued.'

  - term: ついでに
    meaning: While doing X, also do Y (casually/opportunistically)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike 「かたがた」, 「～ついでに」 implies that the secondary action is performed casually or opportunistically,
      often of lesser importance than the primary action, or simply done 'on the way'. It lacks the formal,
      intentional dual purpose of 「かたがた」.
    grammar_point: ついでに (taking the opportunity)
  - term: がてら
    meaning: While doing X, also do Y (at the same time/as a sideline)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「～がてら」 also expresses doing two things at once, it is less formal than 「かたがた」 and often
      implies a more general accompaniment or a secondary action performed 'as a side activity'. It doesn't
      carry the strong sense of a formal, intentional dual purpose that 「かたがた」 does.
    grammar_point: がてら (on the occasion of)
post_false_friends_writeup: The grammar point 「かたがた」 expresses a formal, simultaneous purpose for an action,
  emphasizing that both objectives are intended. It is often confused with expressions that convey secondary
  actions or less formal concurrent activities, such as 「～ついでに」 and 「～がてら」. While 「～ついでに」 suggests doing
  something casually on the way or taking advantage of an opportunity for a secondary, less important
  action, 「～がてら」 indicates doing two things at the same time, often as a less formal and more general
  accompaniment. Both of these are more casual than 「かたがた」, which specifically emphasizes a formal, dual
  purpose, often involving a visit or formal communication, where the secondary purpose is not merely
  an afterthought but a recognized part of the overall intention.

      the nuance of 「かたがた」, which is often used in situations involving important social rites or familial
      obligations. The entire phrase signifies respect and a multi-layered purpose.

    setting: storytelling
    nuance: 「妊娠 (にんしん)」 is a deeply personal and significant life event. Using 「かたがた」 here emphasizes
      the formality and seriousness of the visit, beyond just delivering information. It suggests the
      visit was also for receiving blessings or discussing future plans, making it appropriate for a semi-formal
      setting when speaking to an acquaintance, rather than a very close friend. The mention of 「相手の 両親
      (あいてのりょうしん)」 refers to the partner's parents, which is a common and neutral way to phrase it.

          - 歓迎 会 を 開催 し、皆 様 と 親睦 を 深める 機会 と なれ ば 幸い です。
        english: I hope that holding a welcome party and creating an opportunity to deepen fellowship
          with everyone will be fortunate.
        hint: This alternative, while grammatically correct, treats the welcome party and deepening fellowship
          as separate, sequential events. We're looking for a phrase that emphasizes that the party itself
          is designed to achieve both goals simultaneously.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 歓迎 会 の ついで に、皆 様 と 親睦 を 深める 機会 と なれ ば 幸い です。
        english: I hope that incidentally to the welcome party, it becomes an opportunity to deepen fellowship
          with everyone.
        hint: 「ついでに」 implies the party is just a "side trip" for deepening fellowship, which weakens the
          intended dual purpose. We're looking for a phrase that expresses a formal, combined purpose.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 歓迎 会 がてら、皆 様 と 親睦 を 深める 機会 と なれ ば 幸い です。
        english: I hope that while having a welcome party, it becomes an opportunity to deepen fellowship
          with everyone.
        hint: 「がてら」 is less formal and often implies a general accompaniment. We're looking for a phrase
          that expresses a formal, combined purpose for the event.
    scene: An organizer is drafting an invitation or making an announcement for a welcome party, emphasizing
      that its purpose is not just to welcome new members, but also to build stronger relationships among
      all attendees.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: This phrasing is common in formal invitations or announcements, especially in professional
      or community settings. 「歓迎会 (かんげいかい)」 (welcome party) and 「親睦を深める (しんぼくを ふかめる)」 (to deepen fellowship)
      are formal terms. 「かたがた」 here elegantly conveys that the party serves both as a welcome event and
      as a means to foster closer relationships, highlighting its multi-faceted, intended purpose. The
      closing 「幸いです (さいわいです)」 (it would be fortunate/I would be pleased) maintains a polite and hopeful
      tone.
  - english: I visited my colleague, partly to deliver the documents and also to check on his health.
    japanese:
      - 書類 の お 届け {かたがた}、同僚 の お 見舞い に 参り まし た。
      - 書類 お 渡し {かたがた}、同僚 の 容体 を 確認 し に 行き まし た。
      - 書類 の ご 提出 {かたがた}、同僚 の 様子 を 伺い に 参り まし た。
    english_literally: Document's delivery {along with}, to my colleague's visit, I went.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 書類 を 届ける ため に、同僚 の お 見舞い に 参り まし た。
        english: I went to visit my colleague to deliver the documents.
        hint: This phrase uses 「ために」 to express a single purpose. We're looking for an expression that
          suggests two intended purposes for one action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 書類 を 届ける ついで に、同僚 の お 見舞い に 参り まし た。
        english: Incidentally to delivering the documents, I went to visit my colleague.
        hint: 「ついでに」 implies the secondary action is opportunistic or casual, not an intended dual purpose.
          We're looking for an expression that conveys a formal, planned dual purpose.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 書類 を 届け がてら、同僚 の お 見舞い に 参り まし た。
        english: While delivering the documents, I also went to visit my colleague.
        hint: 「がてら」 is less formal and often implies a general accompaniment. This context requires a
          more formal expression for intended dual purposes.
    scene: A manager explains to their team about visiting a sick colleague, emphasizing that the visit
      was not just personal but also had a work-related task.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The usage of `お届け (おとどけ)` as a humble noun form and `お見舞い (おみまい)` (visit to a sick person)
      as another noun demonstrates the formal and polite nature of the visit, fitting the `かたがた` structure
      perfectly. The `参りました (まいりました)` further enhances the humble register.
  - english: I attended the academic conference, partly for my research presentation and also to meet
      influential scholars.
    japanese:
      - 研究 発表 {かたがた}、著名 な 学者 の 方々 と の 交流 を 図る ため に、学会 に 参加 いたし まし た。
      - 研究 報告 {かたがた}、人脈 構築 の ため に、学会 へ の 出席 を 決意 し まし た。
      - 論文 発表 {かたがた}、専門 家 の 方々 と の 意見 交換 を 目的 に、会議 に 参加 し まし た。
    english_literally: Research presentation {along with}, influential scholars with interaction to plan
      for, academic conference attended.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 研究 発表 を する ため に、著名 な 学者 の 方々 と 交流 する ため に、学会 に 参加 いたし まし た。
        english: I attended the academic conference for the purpose of my research presentation and for
          the purpose of meeting influential scholars.
        hint: This alternative uses 「〜ために」 twice, presenting two separate purposes. We're looking for
          a single action that encompasses both intended goals.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 研究 発表 の ついで に、著名 な 学者 の 方々 と の 交流 を 図る ため に、学会 に 参加 いたし まし た。
        english: Incidentally to my research presentation, I attended the academic conference to meet
          influential scholars.
        hint: 「ついでに」 implies the networking aspect was merely opportunistic. We're looking for an expression
          that implies both presenting and networking were equally intended purposes.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 研究 発表 がてら、著名 な 学者 の 方々 と の 交流 を 図る ため に、学会 に 参加 いたし まし た。
        english: While doing my research presentation, I also attended the academic conference to meet
          influential scholars.
        hint: 「がてら」 implies a more casual dual activity. We're looking for a formal expression for intended,
          professional dual purposes.
    scene: A young researcher explains their activities to their advisor, detailing how their attendance
      at the conference served both their explicit duty (presenting) and their implicit goal (networking).
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: 「研究発表 (けんきゅうはっぴょう)」 (research presentation) and 「交流を図る (こうりゅうをはかる)」 (to plan for interaction)
      as key elements highlight the dual, professional objectives. The use of `著名な学者の方々 (ちょめいながくしゃのかたがた)`
      and `学会 (がっかい)` reinforces the academic and formal context, where `かたがた` effectively conveys integrated
      purposes.
  - english: The mayor visited the disaster area, partly to offer words of encouragement and also to grasp
      the local situation.
    japanese:
      - 市長 は、被災 地 へ の 激励 {かたがた}、現地 の 状況 把握 の ため に 視察 に 訪れ まし た。
      - 市長 は、被災 者 へ の 慰問 {かたがた}、復興 状況 の 確認 の ため に 視察 に 訪れ まし た。
      - 市長 は、被災 地 へ の 激励 の ご 挨拶 {かたがた}、現場 の 状況 を 直接 視察 し まし た。
    english_literally: Mayor as topic, disaster area to encouragement {along with}, local situation grasp
      for, inspection visited.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 市長 は、被災 地 へ 激励 の 言葉 を 述べる ため に、現地 の 状況 を 把握 する ため に 視察 に 訪れ まし た。
        english: The mayor visited the disaster area for the purpose of offering words of encouragement
          and for the purpose of grasping the local situation.
        hint: This alternative explicitly lists two purposes, making them sound separate. We're looking
          for a phrasing that integrates both purposes into a single, purposeful action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 市長 は、被災 地 へ の 激励 の ついで に、現地 の 状況 を 把握 する ため に 視察 に 訪れ まし た。
        english: Incidentally to offering encouragement to the disaster area, the mayor visited to grasp
          the local situation.
        hint: 「ついでに」 implies that grasping the situation was a mere afterthought or secondary opportunistic
          action. We're looking for an expression where both purposes are equally intended and significant.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 市長 は、被災 地 へ の 激励 がてら、現地 の 状況 を 把握 する ため に 視察 に 訪れ まし た。
        english: While offering encouragement to the disaster area, the mayor also visited to grasp the
          local situation.
        hint: 「がてら」 implies a more casual concurrent action. We're looking for a formal expression for
          intended, official dual purposes.
    scene: A news report or official statement about a public figure's visit, where the visit is presented
      as serving both a morale-boosting and an information-gathering purpose.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「激励 (げきれい)」 (encouragement) and 「状況把握 (じょうきょうはあく)」 (grasping the situation) are both formal
      nouns, indicating the serious and official nature of the mayor's visit. `視察 (しさつ)` (inspection)
      is also a formal term for an official visit to observe. The use of `かたがた` here is common in formal
      reports to concisely describe multi-purpose actions by officials.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 「かたがた」 is consistently employed in formal contexts to express
  that an action encompasses multiple, intentional purposes. It is a nuanced expression that adds a layer
  of sophistication to communication by implying more than what is explicitly stated.
