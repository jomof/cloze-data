details:
  part-of-speech: suffix
  register: casual
  usage-context: Often used for unpleasant or dirty substances (e.g., blood, mud, dust, sweat, oil). It
    emphasizes being thoroughly covered, often to the point of being unrecognizable or messy. It can also
    describe a person's state (e.g., debt-ridden).
  nuance: Implies a state of being thoroughly and often undesirably covered. The substance is typically
    liquid, viscous, or granular. It suggests a messy, dirty, or problematic situation.
  colocation: Often collocates with nouns like 泥 (doro - mud), 血 (chi - blood), 汗 (ase - sweat), 油 (abura
    - oil), 埃 (hokori - dust), 借金 (shakkin - debt - metaphorical).
etymology: The suffix 「まみれ」 is derived from the verb 「まみれる」 (mamireru), meaning "to be smeared, to be
  covered with." It carries the nuance of being stained or defiled, often with something unpleasant or
  difficult to remove. This origin emphasizes the thorough and often negative coating aspect.
writeup: |-
  〜まみれ is a suffix used to describe something that is completely covered or smeared with a substance. It is primarily attached to nouns, indicating a state of being thoroughly coated. The key nuance of 〜まみれ is that the substance is typically messy, dirty, or undesirable. Common examples include mud, blood, sweat, dust, or oil. It can also be used metaphorically, such as being "debt-ridden" (借金まみれ).

  This grammar point emphasizes the thoroughness of the covering, often suggesting a visually prominent and somewhat negative condition. It differs from other similar expressions by its strong implication of being smeared or stained rather than just containing many instances of something.

  - term: だらけ
    meaning: covered in; full of.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both まみれ and だらけ indicate being full of something, だらけ is more general and often implies
      a large quantity or abundance of items (e.g., 傷だらけ - full of scratches, 間違いだらけ - full of mistakes).
      It can refer to objects or intangible things. まみれ specifically implies being smeared or coated with
      a substance, typically a messy one.
    grammar_point: '[Noun]だらけ (full of, negative nuance)'
  - term: ずくめ
    meaning: completely; entirely.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ずくめ indicates something being entirely of a certain kind or completely filled with something,
      often carrying a positive or neutral connotation (e.g., 良いことずくめ - nothing but good things, 黒ずくめ
      - dressed entirely in black). まみれ almost always implies a messy or undesirable coating.
    grammar_point: '[Noun]ずくめ (entirely・completely)'
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between 〜まみれ and 〜だらけ, consider the nature of what is covering
  something. If it's a messy substance that smeared or stained something, 〜まみれ is the better choice. If
  it's about being full of many individual items or flaws, 〜だらけ is more appropriate. 〜ずくめ, on the other
  hand, describes being entirely of one kind or filled with something, often with a more positive or neutral
  feeling.
