    },
    "etymology": "「当たり」 comes from the verb 「当たる」 (ataru), which means \"to hit\" or \"to meet.\" In this grammatical context, it implies a relation or correspondence 'in relation to' or 'regarding'. Think of it as each item \"hitting\" or corresponding to a particular value.",
    "writeup": "The grammatical expression **当たり** is formed by attaching the noun **当たり** (meaning \"to hit\" or \"to meet\") as a suffix to numbers or counters. In this context, it functions to express a rate or a uniform amount per unit. It is commonly translated as \"per (A)\", \"each (A)\", or \"apiece\".\n\nWhile the literal meaning of the word **当たり** is \"to come into physical contact with\" or \"to strike,\" its function as a suffix carries a nuance similar to **に対して** (ni taishite), which means \"in relation to\" or \"regarding.\" This indicates a correspondence where, for a given unit (A), a certain quantity or value (B) is assigned. Therefore, the structure `(A) 当たり (B)` can be understood as \"Regarding (A), (B) equates to it,\" signifying a direct proportional relationship or allocation.",

            "speaker_age": "younger",
            "nuance": "This is a straightforward inquiry about price per item. The expression 「一 個 当たり」 clarifies that the price applies to each individual apple, not the entire batch. The usage is common regardless of speaker's gender or age.",
            "etymology": "The kanji 個 (ko) for counter is derived from the Chinese character meaning 'individual' or 'piece'."
