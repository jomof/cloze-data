        "nuance": "While both are largely interchangeable, 「によると」 implies a higher level of certainty or reliability, often used for official or legitimate sources like news or police. 「によれば」 is slightly less formal and can be used more broadly. 「によりますと」 is a more formal variant of 「によると」."
    },
    "etymology": "「によると」 is formed from 「に」 (case marking particle), 「よる」 (the verb meaning \"to depend on\" or \"to be based on\"), and 「と」 (conjunction particle). 「によれば」 uses the same 「に」 and 「よる」, but replaces 「と」 with 「ば」, the conditional form conjunction particle. The verb 「よる」 is almost always written in hiragana alone, but it can be written with several kanji (依る, 拠る, 因る, 由る), each carrying slightly different nuances while broadly conveying the idea of 'based on' or 'originating from'.",
    "writeup": "「によると」 and 「によれば」 are fixed phrases used to introduce information by stating its source. The phrases translate to \"according to\" or \"based on.\" This structure is fundamental for citing information from various sources, ranging from official reports to casual hearsay.\n\nThe particle 「に」 in this construction points to the source. The verb 「よる」, while literally meaning \"to depend on\" or \"to be based on,\" functions here to connect the source to the reported information. The final particles, 「と」 and 「ば」, dictate the nuance.\n\n**「によると」** typically implies a higher degree of certainty or reliability regarding the source. It is frequently used when citing formal or authoritative sources, such as news reports, official statements, or research findings. For instance, when quoting the police or a weather forecast, 「によると」 is commonly preferred.\n\n**「によれば」**, while also meaning \"according to,\" is generally considered slightly less formal than 「によると」. It can be used more broadly for a variety of sources, including informal ones like friends or rumors. Although largely interchangeable with 「によると」 in many contexts, 「によれば」 carries a slightly softer implication, suggesting the information is simply relayed rather than officially verified.\n\n**「によりますと」** is a more polite and formal variation of 「によると」, often used in professional settings, public announcements, or formal presentations to show respect to the audience or the source.\n\nWhen introducing information, the source (a noun or a clause ending in 「ところ」) precedes the grammar point. The information itself then follows, often with forms indicating hearsay or inference, such as 「～そうです」 or 「～らしいです」.",
