    "etymology": "The word ばかり is rarely written with kanji in modern Japanese, but its origin can be traced back to 許り (or sometimes 計る). The kanji 許り literally means \"to permit\" or \"to allow through.\" This implies that only a specific thing is \"permitted\" or present in a given situation, leading to the modern meaning of exclusivity or limitation. This historical context illuminates how ばかり came to convey the nuance of \"nothing but\" or \"only.\"",
    "writeup": "The particle **ばかり** primarily conveys the nuance of \"nothing but,\" \"only,\" or \"always doing\" a specific action or having a particular state. It emphasizes exclusivity or a predominant characteristic, often with a slightly negative or exasperated connotation.\n\n*   When attached to the **て-form of a verb** (e.g., Vてばかり), it indicates that someone is constantly, excessively, or exclusively engaged in that action. It is frequently followed by いる to denote a continuous state, though いる can be omitted in some contexts.\n*   When used after a **noun** (e.g., Nounばかり), it implies that something consists solely of that noun or that only that noun is present. This usage can also carry a critical tone, suggesting an excess or imbalance.\n*   It can also connect to a noun using の, forming 「NounばかりのNoun」, to describe something that is characterized exclusively by the first noun.\n\nWhile **ばかり** can be written with the kanji 許り, this is extremely rare in contemporary Japanese. It is almost always written in hiragana.",

In contrast, **だけ**, while also meaning 'only,' is generally neutral. For example, 「彼はゲームをするだけだ」 could simply mean that playing games is the only thing he does, without necessarily implying an excessive amount or negative judgment. Similarly, **しか〜ない** emphasizes limitation and necessity in a negative construction, as in 「ジュースしか飲まない」 (I only drink juice, and nothing else). **だけしか** reinforces this restrictive nuance, providing an even stronger emphasis on exclusivity. On the other hand, **ばかりでなく** and **だけでなく〜も** are used to indicate 'not only... but also,' which is the opposite of the exclusivity conveyed by **ばかり**. Lastly, **ばかりだ** (when combined with a plain verb) and **ばかりに** are distinct grammatical patterns: **ばかりだ** signifies a continuous or escalating state, while **ばかりに** indicates a cause or reason leading to an unfortunate outcome.",
