    "etymology": "The origin of ばかり is 許り (sometimes 計る), which means \"to let off\" or \"to let through.\" The implication is that only the specified thing is being \"permitted\" in a given situation.",
    "writeup": "The particle **ばかり** indicates that something is the only thing or state that exists, or the only action someone takes/has taken/is taking. It conveys the nuance of \"nothing but\" or \"only.\"\n\n*   When used after the *te*-form of a verb (てばかり), it indicates that someone does nothing but that action. It's often followed by いる but doesn't have to be.\n*   When used after a noun (ばかりだ), it indicates that nothing but that noun exists.\n\nWhile ばかり can be written in kanji as 許り, it is rarely seen that way in modern Japanese.",

In contrast, while **だけ** also means 'only,' it is generally neutral. 「彼はゲームをするだけだ」 could simply mean that playing games is the only thing he does, without necessarily implying an excessive amount or negative judgment. Similarly, **しか〜ない** emphasizes limitation and necessity in a negative construction, like 「ジュースしか飲まない」 (I only drink juice, and nothing else). While **だけしか** reinforces this restrictive nuance, **ばかり** emphasizes the *nature* of what is being done or present, often suggesting 'too much' or 'nothing but' and frequently carries a sense of criticism or exasperation. **ばかりでなく** and **だけでなく〜も** are used to indicate 'not only... but also,' which is the opposite of exclusivity conveyed by **ばかり**. Lastly, **ばかりだ** (when combined with a plain verb) and **ばかりに** are distinct grammatical patterns, with **ばかりだ** signifying a continuous or escalating state, and **ばかりに** indicating a cause or reason.",
