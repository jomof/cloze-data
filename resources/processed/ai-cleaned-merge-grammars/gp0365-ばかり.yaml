    "etymology": "ばかり originally comes from 許り (sometimes 計る). This kanji means \"to let off\" or \"to let through,\" implying that (A) is the only thing being 'permitted' in a specific situation.",
    "writeup": "The adverbial particle 「ばかり」 highlights that \"nothing but (A) is being done\" or \"only (A) exists.\" It's used after verbs in the te-form or after nouns. \n\nWhen used with verbs, 「てばかり」 is often followed by 「いる」, which is similar to the standard 「ている」 form. However, adding 「いる」 is not always required to convey the same nuance. \n\nWhen a sentence has a part (A) and a part (B), 「ばかり」 will be followed by either 「で」 (with verbs or nouns) or 「いて」 (only with verbs) when 「ばかり」 appears directly before the sentence's conjunction point.\n\nIt's important to note that the 「で」 with 「ばかり」 is the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb 「だ」, not the particle 「で」. \n\n「ばかり」 is rarely written in kanji, but when it is, it is written as 「許り」 or 「計り」.",
