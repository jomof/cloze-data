The combination creates an adverbial phrase that indicates a shared state, action, or quality.",
    "writeup": "**と共に (to tomoni)** expresses the idea of things happening simultaneously, or of sharing a common property. It can be translated as \"together with,\" \"at the same time as,\" or \"as well as.\" It's often used in more formal writing and speech. You'll see it after nouns, verbs in dictionary form, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives (often with \"である\"). It indicates that two things exist or occur in conjunction with each other.
