    "etymology": "「と考えられる」 is formed from the particle 「と」 (to), the verb 「考える」 (kangaeru, to think), and the auxiliary verb 「られる」 (rareru), which here indicates potential or passive voice. Thus, the literal sense is 'it is possible to think' or 'it can be thought'.",
    "writeup": "「と考えられる」 is used to express an objective opinion or a possibility in Japanese. It combines 「と」, indicating a quote or content, with the potential/passive form of 「考える」 (to think), which is 「考えられる」. It translates to \"can be considered as,\" \"is thought to be,\" or \"it is conceivable that.\"\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   This structure often appears at the end of phrases, turning them into quoted content.\n*   For subjective opinions, 「と思われる」 is used instead.\n*   「と考えられる」 emphasizes judgment, while 「と考えられている」 typically conveys widely accepted opinions. Think of 「考えられている」 as generally accepted facts. For example, 「水は冷たいと考えられている」.",
