    "etymology": "The particle 「わ」 is believed to have originated from the adverbial particle 「は」. Although they share an origin, their functions and usage differ significantly. 「は」 typically marks a topic, whereas 「わ」 functions exclusively as a sentence-ending particle.",
    "writeup": "The sentence-ending particle 「わ」 is primarily used by women to add a soft, feminine tone to their statements. It can express emphasis, emotion, or seek agreement. Think of it as adding a touch of softness or charm to what you are saying. It's often used when expressing personal feelings, giving advice, or making a gentle assertion.\n\nWhile mainly used by women, men may use 「わ」 to express surprise or light exasperation, especially in western Japan. The pitch differs noticeably when used by men compared to women, often rising for women and falling for men. Pay attention to the context and tone to understand the speaker's intent.\n\nFor female speakers, 「わ」 adds a gentle, persuasive tone and can be translated as \"you know?\", \"oh?\", or \"ever so (A)\", where (A) is something the speaker wants to emphasize. For male speakers, it typically indicates surprise or mild annoyance about something unavoidable or a sudden realization. It is used after the plain form of words, including verbs, adjectives, and auxiliary verbs in their unconjugated forms, such as 「だ」 and 「です」.",
