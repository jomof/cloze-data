jlpt: N2
details:
  register: casual
  usage-context: General use
  nuance: Implies a fundamental lack of method or means to perform an action, or an inherent impossibility.
  grammatical-role: adverbial phrase
etymology: The grammar point 「ようがない」 and 「ようもない」 derives from the noun 「様 (よう)」, which means "way," "method,"
  or "manner," combined with the negative auxiliary verb 「ない」 or 「ない」's more emphatic form 「もない」. It literally
  translates to "there is no way" or "there is no method."
writeup: |-
  「ようがない」 or 「ようもない」 is an expression used to highlight that there is no 'method' or 'manner' in which to do something. It can be interpreted as 'there is no way to (A)', or 'it's impossible to (A)'. This phrase will appear attached to the masu-stem form of verbs. 「ようがない」 often focuses on that the action of (A) is not possible, despite that the speaker may actually want to do it.

  **Important Considerations**
  *   Because 「様」 will often appear in hiragana, it is important not to get it mixed up with 「よう」, the auxiliary verb used to create the volitional form of verbs such as 「する」. So, this grammar point is not related to volitional form.

  - term: がたい
    meaning: Hard to, Difficult to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「ようがない」, 「がたい」 emphasizes the difficulty in performing the action, often due to emotional
      or psychological reasons.
    grammar_point: がたい (hard to do)
  - term: っこない
    meaning: There is no chance of, There is no way of, Impossible
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「ようがない」, 「っこない」 is more emphatic and often used in casual speech to express strong
      disbelief or certainty that something will not happen.
    grammar_point: っこない (no chance of)
  - term: はずがない
    meaning: Hardly possible, Cannot be, Highly unlikely, Improbable
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「ようがない」, 「はずがない」 is used to express that something is highly unlikely based on reason
      or expectation, rather than an absolute impossibility.
    grammar_point: '[Clause]はずだ・はずがない (is expected to be・cannot be)'
  - term: わけがない
    meaning: There is no way, There is no reason, It is impossible, Cannot be
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「ようがない」, 「わけがない」 often implies that there is no logical reason or justification for
      something to be possible.
    grammar_point: わけがない (no way)
  - term: そうもない
    meaning: Very unlikely to, Does not seem that, Does not appear that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike 「ようがない」, 「そうもない」 expresses a weaker level of impossibility, indicating that something
      is unlikely to happen based on appearance or feeling, rather than an absolute inability.
    grammar_point: そうにない・そうもない (unlikely to)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing up 「ようがない」 with these similar expressions, focus on the specific
  nuance you want to convey. If you want to express difficulty due to emotional reasons, use 「がたい」. For
  strong disbelief, use 「っこない」. To indicate improbability based on reason, use 「はずがない」. If there's no
  logical reason, choose 「わけがない」. For a weaker sense of unlikelihood, 「そうもない」 is more appropriate. 「ようがない」
  is best when there's simply no way to accomplish something.

        hint: 「～っこない」 expresses strong certainty that something will not happen, often used casually.
          「～ようがない」 focuses on the absence of a method or means to accomplish the action. We're looking
          for a grammar point that expresses a fundamental lack of method or solution to repair the TV,
          despite effort, rather than just strong impossibility in general. Therefore, "できっこない" (there's
          no way it can be done, implies strong certainty of impossibility) is not quite the same nuance
          as "しようがない" (there's no method/means to do it).

          there is no method or means to accomplish the repair, regardless of logical expectation. We're
          looking for a grammar point that expresses a fundamental lack of method or solution to repair
          the TV, despite effort, rather than just logical impossibility. Therefore, "できるはずがない" (it shouldn't
          be possible to repair it, implies logical impossibility) is not quite the same nuance as "しようがない"

          that expresses a fundamental lack of method or solution to repair the TV, despite effort, rather
          than just that it doesn't seem likely based on appearance. Therefore, "できそうもない" (doesn't seem
          repairable) is not quite the same nuance as "しようがない" (no way to repair, implies lack of method).

          - テレビ が 壊れ て い て、修理 が {でき ない}。
        english: My TV is broken, and it cannot be repaired.
        hint: The scene emphasizes the effort "no matter how hard I try" to highlight the futility and
          lack of a viable approach. 「修理が できない」 implies a simple inability, while 「修理のしようがない」 emphasizes
          the absence of a method or solution despite effort. We're looking for a phrase that specifically
          highlights the absence of a *method* or *approach* to fix the TV, even with effort, rather than
          just a general inability. Therefore, "修理ができない" (can't repair) is not quite the same nuance as

          「捨てようもない」 better captures than a simple potential form. 「捨てられない」 implies a physical inability
          or external constraint, while 「捨てようもない」 suggests an internal, emotional barrier to finding a

          fundamental impossibility due to a lack of *method* or *means* to change the past, rather than
          just logical improbability. Therefore, "変えられるはずがない" (shouldn't be possible to change) is not
          quite the same nuance as "変えようがない" (no way to change, implies lack of method).

        hint: The scene focuses on the fundamental impossibility of altering past events, making 「変えようがない」
          more apt than a simple potential form. 「変えられない」 implies that it's physically impossible to change,
          but 「変えようがない」 conveys that there is simply no *method* or *approach* to changing what has already
          occurred. We're looking for a phrase that emphasizes the fundamental impossibility due to a
          lack of *method* or *approach* to changing the past, rather than just a general inability. Therefore,
          "変えられない" (cannot change) is not quite the same nuance as "変えようがない" (no way to change, implies
          lack of method).

        hint: The scene implies the speaker's assessment of the situation's inherent difficulty, making
          it an impossibility for *her* to climb, rather than just an inability. 「登れない」 is a simple statement
          of inability, whereas 「登りようがない」 emphasizes that no strategy or effort would make it possible.
          We're looking for a phrase that highlights the inherent impossibility due to a lack of *method*
          or *strategy* to climb the slope, rather than just a general inability. Therefore, "登れない" (cannot
          climb) is not quite the same nuance as "登りようがない" (no way to climb, implies lack of method).
    scene: A man observing his friend struggling with a difficult physical task.
    register: casual
    setting: sympathetic
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The male speaker uses the sentence-final particle 「よ」 to convey a sense of gentle assertion
      or to inform the listener, suggesting a sympathetic observation about the woman's struggle. This
      informal particle often implies shared understanding or a slight emphasis on the statement.
    etymology: The use of 「よ」 at the end of the sentence is a common informal particle. 「どんなに 頑張っても」 means
      "no matter how hard she tries," highlighting the futility of effort.

post_example_writeup: As demonstrated by the examples, 「ようがない」 and 「ようもない」 are versatile phrases used
  to express that there is simply no way or method to perform an action. While 「ようもない」 adds a slightly
  stronger sense of emphasis or regret, both forms are often interchangeable. The choice between plain
  and polite forms, like 「～しようがない」 and 「～しようがありません」, depends on the social context and desired level of
  formality with the listener.
