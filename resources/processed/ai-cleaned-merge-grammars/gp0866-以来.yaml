        "[Noun] + 以来": "Indicates that something has continued or will continue uninterrupted since a specific event or time.",
        "[Verb in te-form] + 以来": "Indicates a continuous state or action that began after a certain action.",
        "[Demonstrative Adjective] + 以来": "Since a specific past event indicated by the demonstrative."

    "writeup": "「以来 (irai)」 indicates that something has continued non-stop since a particular event or time. Think of it as \"ever since\". It emphasizes the ongoing state or action that began after the specified event. It can be used with nouns, verbs in て-form, or demonstrative adjectives.\n\n*   **Key Point**: 「以来」 focuses on (B) being something that continues without interruption unless there's an external change.\n*   **Caution**: While 「以来」 can express a number of occurrences since (A), it emphasizes the shocking amount more than a simple 「から」.",
    "etymology": "The term 「以来」 is derived from the verb 「以る(いる)」, meaning \"to take; to use\", combined with 「来(らい)」, meaning \"to come\". Thus, 「以来」 literally implies \"coming from that which was taken\", evolving to its current meaning of \"since\" or \"from that point forward.\"",
