    "etymology": "The term 「以来」 is derived from the verb 「以る (iru)」, meaning \"to take; to use\", combined with 「来 (rai)」, meaning \"to come\". Thus, 「以来」 literally implies \"coming from that which was taken\", evolving to its current meaning of \"since\" or \"from that point forward.\"",

It emphasizes the ongoing state or action that began after the specified event.\n\n**Key Point**: 「以来」 focuses on something that continues without interruption unless there's an external change.\n**Caution**: While 「以来」 can express a number of occurrences since, it emphasizes the lasting impact more than a simple 「から」. It cannot be used with recent events; instead, 「から」 should be used to mark a starting point in the present.",
