    "etymology": "The word 「以来」 is derived from 「以」 (i), meaning \"from\" or \"because of\", and 「来」 (rai), meaning \"to come\" or \"since\". Together, they create the sense of \"from then until now\" or \"since that time.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「以来」 (irai) is used to express that something has continued non-stop since a specific point in time. It can be translated as \"since,\" \"ever since,\" or \"henceforth.\" It emphasizes the ongoing nature of the situation. 「以来」 typically follows a noun referring to an event or a verb in the te-form. It indicates that the situation described has been in effect continuously from the time of the specified event. This is primarily used to indicate that (B) is something that will continue non-stop until a change is caused externally. Occasional 「以来」 may also be used to express a specific number of (B) that has occurred since (A).",
