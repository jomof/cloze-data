    "etymology": "The grammar point combines 「より」 (from/than), 「ほか」 (other), and 「ない」 (not). Literally, it means \"there is nothing other than...\" or \"there is no choice from/than other things.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「より・のほか(に)(は)〜ない」 conveys the strong sense that there is no alternative or option other than the one being described. It expresses a feeling of inevitability or exclusivity. While it can often be translated as 'have no choice but to' or 'nothing but', its nuance implies a lack of any viable alternative whatsoever.\n\nThere are two main patterns:\n\n1.  **Verb (dictionary form) + より ほか ない**: This structure is used when expressing that there is no other action one can take. It often implies resignation or a lack of other options due to circumstances. For example, if faced with a difficult situation, one might say they have no choice but to endure it.\n\n2.  **Noun + の ほか には + Verb (negative)**: This structure indicates exclusivity, meaning 'nothing but' or 'only' the specified noun. It asserts that everything else is excluded. For example, if someone enjoys only one type of food, they might use this pattern to state that they eat nothing but that specific food.\n\nIn both patterns, the particles 「に」 and 「は」 are optional but serve to add emphasis. The particle 「に」 emphasizes the direction or target, while 「は」 adds a contrasting or highlighting nuance. While 「より」 and 「の」 are sometimes interchangeable, 「の」 is more commonly used when followed by a noun, particularly when the phrase functions as a nominalized subject.",

In contrast, 「ざるを得ない」 conveys a feeling of being compelled or forced into an action, often against one's will. Meanwhile, 「しかない」 indicates a limited range of options or a restricted quantity. 「のみ」 is a more formal way to express 'only' or 'just', often used in written language. Choose 「より・のほか(に)(は)〜ない」 when emphasizing that there are truly no other viable paths or that something is uniquely so.",
