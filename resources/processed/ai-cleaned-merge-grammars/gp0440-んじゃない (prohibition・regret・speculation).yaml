jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  function: Prohibition, strong discouragement, or regret.
  nuance: Often used by superiors to inferiors, can sound harsh, but can also be used as a speculative
    question depending on intonation. The more polite form, んじゃありません, softens the prohibition.
etymology: んじゃない is derived from 「の」, a particle that nominalizes the preceding verb, and 「じゃない」, which
  is a colloquial contraction of 「ではない」 (dewa nai), meaning 'is not'. The literal sense is something like
  'it is not the case that you do X'. 「ん」 is a colloquial form of 「の」. The use of 「ん」 as a colloquial
  form of 「の」 (nominalizer) can be seen in other casual expressions, evolving from more formal structures
  to everyday speech.
writeup: |-
  「んじゃない」 is an informal grammar point used to prohibit someone from doing something, or to express regret about something that happened. It's often translated as "don't do (A)" or "you shouldn't have (A)". It's a combination of the particle 「の」 and the abbreviated form of 「ではない」, which is 「じゃない」.

  **Key points:**
  *   **Usage**: Generally used by someone in a higher position towards someone of lower status, and can sound harsh.
  *   **Past Tense**: 「んじゃなかった」 indicates something 'should not have been done' and carries a nuance of regret.
  *   **Intonation**: Be aware that when 「んじゃない」 comes at the end of a sentence, it can be a question (an abbreviation of 「んじゃないか」) if the intonation rises. Otherwise, it is a command.
  *   **ている Form**: It is common to see the abbreviated 「ている」 form, 「てん」, before 「じゃない」. For example, 「食べてんじゃない」 (tabeten janai) means "Don't eat that!"
  *   **More Polite**: The slightly more formal version 「んじゃありません」 can also be used, particularly when the speaker wishes to forbid something without sounding too angry.

  - term: のではないか
    meaning: Isn't it?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「んじゃない」 used for prohibition, 「のではないか」 is a softer way of asking a question or expressing
      a possibility. It is typically more formal than 「んじゃない」 when used as a question.
    grammar_point: のではないだろうか (indirect suggestion)
  - term: わけではない
    meaning: It's not like...
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「わけではない」 expresses a partial negation or clarification, often meaning 'it doesn't necessarily
      mean X'. In contrast, 「んじゃない」 is a direct prohibition or expression of regret.
    grammar_point: わけではない (not necessarily)
  - term: ないでください
    meaning: Please don't
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ないでください」 is a polite request not to do something. 「んじゃない」, on the other hand, is a more forceful
      prohibition or admonition, often used by someone in a position of authority.
    grammar_point: ないでください (please don't)
  - term: てはいけない
    meaning: Must not, cannot
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「てはいけない」 expresses a strong, often general or rule-based, prohibition. 「んじゃない」 is a more direct,
      personal admonition or command, typically from a superior.
    grammar_point: てはいけない (must not・cannot)
  - term: ものではない
    meaning: Shouldn't, cannot (general impropriety)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ものではない」 states that something is generally improper or socially unacceptable. 「んじゃない」 is
      a direct, often immediate prohibition or an expression of regret regarding a specific action.
    grammar_point: ものではない (shouldn't・cannot)
  - term: ばよかった
    meaning: Should have, I wish
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「んじゃなかった」 expresses regret for an action that was performed (e.g., 'I shouldn't have
      done X'), 「ばよかった」 expresses regret for an action that was *not* performed (e.g., 'I should have
      done Y').
    grammar_point: ばよかった (should have)
  - term: だろう
    meaning: Probably, isn't it?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だろう」 expresses a straightforward conjecture. 「んじゃない」 (with rising intonation) is a more informal
      and often softer way of expressing a guess or seeking confirmation, implying 'I think X, don't you?'
    grammar_point: だろう (conjecture)
post_false_friends_writeup: It's important to differentiate between 「んじゃない」, which is a form of direct
  prohibition or regret, and other similar-sounding expressions. For example, 「のではないだろうか (indirect suggestion)」
  is used to soften a statement or to ask a question, while 「わけではない (not necessarily)」 expresses a partial
  negation. Pay attention to the context and intonation to understand the intended meaning. In writing,
  the question mark often distinguishes 「んじゃない」 (as a question) from 「んじゃない」 (as a prohibition). But when
  speaking, the intonation of 「んじゃない」 is key.

        hint: 「べきではない (should not)」 indicates a logical obligation that was not met. 「んじゃなかった」 expresses

          - おもちゃ を 友達 に 貸し なさい。
        english: Lend your toys to your friends.
        hint: 「なさい (polite imperative)」 is a direct command. 「貸さないんじゃありません」 uses a double negative to
          express a softer, more indirect suggestion that something *should* be done. We're looking for
          a gentle, indirect suggestion.
    scene: A mother gently advises her child about the importance of sharing with friends.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male

        hint: 「です (polite copula)」 with 「か (question)」 is a straightforward question. 「んじゃなかった？」 with

          for a speculative question with empathy.
    scene: A supportive boss asks an employee if they found a recent task challenging, showing empathy.

    setting: supportive
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)

          personal advice.

      for a past action.

        hint: 「お〜ください (polite request)」 is a polite request. 「持ち込むんじゃない」 is a more direct, general prohibition,
          often used in announcements or to state a clear rule. We're looking for a direct statement of
          a rule for a general audience.
    scene: A staff member at a movie theater points to a sign and explains a theater rule to a customer

    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: younger

      for a group. It implies "it is not the case that people should bring in food." The context of a
      public facility rule makes it a formal prohibition, even with the slightly informal phrasing of
      「んじゃない」, common in posted signs or direct announcements.

        english: You should not have gone to such a dangerous place alone.
        hint: 「べきではない (should not)」 expresses what was morally or logically obligated. 「んじゃなかった」 expresses
          a stronger, more personal regret or blame concerning a past action. We're looking for an expression
          of regret combined with a mild reproach.
    scene: A concerned friend admonishes another friend who got into trouble after visiting a risky area.
    register: casual
    setting: sympathetic
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    speaker_gender: male

      final particle 「よ」 adds a touch of emphasis and shared understanding, making it sound like empathetic
      advice rather than harsh criticism between friends.

    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: This is a direct and common prohibition used by adults (e.g., teachers, parents) towards children.
      The use of 「走るんじゃない！」 is a clear command, often said with a firm tone, implying 'Don't even think
      about running in the hallway!'
post_example_writeup: As demonstrated, the interpretation of 「んじゃない」 depends heavily on context and intonation.
  A strong, falling intonation usually indicates a prohibition or command, while a rising intonation suggests
  a question or a softer assertion.
