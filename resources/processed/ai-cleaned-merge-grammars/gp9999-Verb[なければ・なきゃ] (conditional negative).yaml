  - Verb[imperative] (imperative)
  - ~なければならない・なきゃ (must do・have to)
  - いい (good)
id: gp9999
meaning: If (one) doesn't do; Unless
pronunciation:
  katakana: ナケレバ・ナキャ
  romaji: nakereba・nakya
formation:
  Verb (ない-form, drop い) + なければ: Standard negative conditional. This form is derived from Verb + ない (negative)
    + ば (conditional particle).
  Verb (ない-form, drop い) + なきゃ: Casual contraction of なければ. Commonly used in everyday speech.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The expression なければ originates from the negative auxiliary verb ない (nai), meaning 'not,' combined
  with the classical conditional particle ば (ba). Historically, the い of ない transformed into けれ when followed
  by ば, leading to なければ, literally meaning 'if it is not.' The form なきゃ is a modern, phonetic contraction
  of なければ, widely adopted in informal spoken Japanese due to its ease of pronunciation.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point Verb[なければ・なきゃ] is fundamental for expressing negative conditionals in Japanese. It translates to 'if (one) doesn't do X' or 'unless X is done.' You form it by attaching なければ or its casual contraction なきゃ to the stem of a verb's negative plain form (V-ない, dropping the い).

  **なければ** is the standard form. It is versatile and appropriate for a wide range of situations, from casual conversation to more structured writing. It clearly establishes a condition where the absence of an action or state is a prerequisite for a subsequent event.

  **なきゃ** is a casual, contracted form of なければ. It is extremely common in everyday spoken Japanese among friends, family, and peers. However, it should be avoided in formal contexts. Its use signals a relaxed and informal tone.

  This conditional construction is essential for conveying logical dependencies where the non-occurrence of an action directly leads to a particular outcome. For example, if you don't turn off the lights, the electricity bill will be high. The conditional phrase precisely sets up this cause-and-effect relationship.
false_friends:
  - term: ~なければならない (must do・have to)
    meaning: must do, have to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜なければならない」 expresses obligation or necessity, meaning 'one must do X.' In contrast, 「〜なければ」
      simply states a negative condition 'if one does not do X,' without inherently implying obligation.
      While a consequence often follows, the conditional form itself doesn't mean 'must.'
    grammar_point: ~なければならない・なきゃ (must do・have to)
  - term: ~ないでください (please don't)
    meaning: please don't do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜ないでください」 is a direct negative request or command, telling someone 'please don't do X.' 「〜なければ」,
      however, is a conditional clause ('if X doesn't happen'), not a direct command. The speaker is not
      directly asking for the non-occurrence of X.
    grammar_point: ないでください・ないで (please don't)
  - term: Verb[ない]まま (without doing)
    meaning: without doing, leaving something undone
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜ないまま」 describes a state where an action was not performed or a condition remained unchanged,
      meaning 'without doing X' or 'leaving X undone.' This focuses on the state or manner, whereas 「〜なければ」
      focuses on a conditional relationship where the non-action leads to a consequence.
    grammar_point: 〜まま(に) (as is・unchanged)
  - term: Verb[なかったら] (if not)
    meaning: if (one) had not done, if (one) does not do (past/hypothetical)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both 「〜なければ」 and 「〜なかったら」 express negative conditionals. However, 「〜なかったら」, using the た-form,
      often carries a nuance of a hypothetical or completed negative action, or a stronger sense of consequence
      tied to that non-action, particularly when referring to the past or a strong hypothetical future.
      「〜なければ」 focuses more on the ongoing or general condition of not doing something.
    grammar_point: たら (conditional, when・if A then B)
post_false_friends_writeup: To effectively use these expressions, remember that 「〜なければ」 primarily sets
  a condition where the non-occurrence of an action or state dictates a subsequent event. It is distinct
  from expressing obligation, issuing direct negative requests, or merely describing a state of inaction.
  While 「〜なかったら」 is very similar, consider 「〜なければ」 as a general 'if not' conditional, especially when
  the consequence is a straightforward logical result. In contrast, 「〜なかったら」 can imply a more hypothetical
  or completed non-action with a direct and often more emphasized consequence.
examples:
  - english: If you don't study, you won't pass the exam.
    japanese:
      - 勉強 し なけれ ば、試験 に 合格 でき ませ ん。
      - 勉強 し なけれ ば、試験 に 合格 でき ない。
    english_literally: If (you) don't study, (you) cannot pass the exam.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 勉強 し なかっ たら、試験 に 合格 でき ませ ん。
        english: If you hadn't studied, you wouldn't pass the exam.
        hint: 「〜なかったら」 is often used for hypothetical or past negative conditions. We're looking for a
          general conditional for not doing something.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 勉強 し ない で、試験 に 合格 でき ませ ん。
        english: By not studying, you cannot pass the exam.
        hint: 「〜ないで」 indicates 'without doing' or 'by not doing' and often describes a manner or state,
          rather than a direct conditional like 'if not X, then Y.' We're looking for a conditional relationship.
    scene: A teacher advising a student about an upcoming exam.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: academic
    nuance: This sentence uses the standard 「しなければ」 to present a clear, logical consequence of not studying.
      The polite form 「できません」 is suitable for a teacher-student interaction. The usage implies a general
      truth.
    etymology: '「合格」 (gōkaku) meaning ''passing an exam'' or ''success'' combines 合 (gō: fit, suit) and
      格 (kaku: status, rule), implying meeting the required standard.'
  - english: If you don't hurry, you'll be late for the meeting.
    japanese:
      - 急が なけれ ば、会議 に 遅刻 し ます よ。
      - 急が なけれ ば、会議 に 遅刻 する よ。
    english_literally: If (you) don't hurry, (you) will be late for the meeting, you know.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 急が ない なら、会議 に 遅刻 し ます よ。
        english: If it's the case that you don't hurry, you'll be late for the meeting.
        hint: 「〜ないなら」 emphasizes that the condition ('not hurrying') is a known or assumed fact, or a
          specific scenario, rather than a general conditional consequence. We're looking for a general
          conditional.
    scene: A colleague reminding another colleague about a meeting.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    nuance: The use of 「なければ」 here conveys a simple, direct conditional warning. The particle 「よ」 at the
      end softens the warning and makes it sound more helpful, suitable between colleagues.
    etymology: '「遅刻」 (chikoku) meaning ''lateness'' or ''being late'' combines 遅 (chi: late, slow) and
      刻 (koku: time,刻む - to engrave time), literally meaning ''slow time'' or ''engraved late''.'
  - english: If you don't clean your room, your mom will get mad.
    japanese:
      - 部屋 を 片付け なきゃ、お 母 さん 怒る よ。
      - 部屋 を 片付け なけれ ば、お 母 さん 怒る よ。
      - 部屋 を 片付け なけれ ば、お 母 さん 怒り ます よ。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 部屋 を 片付け ない と、お 母 さん 怒る よ。
        english: If you don't clean your room, your mom will get mad.
        hint: 「〜ないと」 is a very common informal conditional that often implies a negative consequence.
          It can sometimes be used interchangeably, but 「〜なければ」 (or 「なきゃ」) is the more grammatically complete
          conditional form. We're looking for the standard conditional structure.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 部屋 を 片付け ない まま、お 母 さん 怒る よ。
        english: With your room remaining uncleaned, your mom will get mad.
        hint: 「〜ないまま」 describes a state of not doing something. It emphasizes the condition or manner
          of remaining, rather than the 'if-then' conditional. We're looking for a conditional.
    scene: An older sister talking to her younger brother.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「片付けなきゃ」 is a casual contraction, perfectly fitting for a conversation between siblings. The
      use of 「怒る よ」 is also very casual and direct, implying a natural consequence that the listener is
      aware of. The overall tone is natural for an older sister to a younger brother.
    etymology: '「片付ける」 (katazukeru) meaning ''to tidy up'' or ''to put in order'' comes from 片 (kata:
      one side, fragment) and 付ける (tsukeru: to attach), suggesting putting things together or in their
      designated place.'
  - english: If I don't go to work tomorrow, I won't get paid.
    japanese:

      - 明日 仕事 に 行か なけれ ば、給料 が 出 ませ ん。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 仕事 に 行か ない なら、給料 が 出 ない。
        english: If it's the case that I don't go to work tomorrow, I won't get paid.
        hint: 「〜ないなら」 implies a decision or a given situation. We're looking for a more general 'if not'
          conditional.
    scene: A person lamenting their situation to themselves.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: This is an internal thought, so the casual 「出 ない」 (for 出ません) is natural. 「行かなければ」 states a
      logical and unavoidable consequence directly tied to not going to work. The speaker is reflecting
      on a personal necessity.
    etymology: '「給料」 (kyūryō) meaning ''salary'' or ''wages'' combines 給 (kyū: supply, provide) and 料
      (ryō: fee, material), literally referring to the ''provided materials'' or ''provided fees'' for
      work.'
  - english: If you don't leave soon, you'll miss the last train.

          - すぐ 出発 し ない と、終電 に 間に合わ ない よ。
        english: If you don't leave soon, you'll miss the last train.
        hint: 「〜ないと」 is a common informal conditional, similar to 「なきゃ」 but sometimes with a stronger
          implication of an undesirable outcome. We're focusing on the base 'if not' conditional.
    scene: A friend urging another friend to leave.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    nuance: The use of 「しなければ」 here, while slightly more formal than 「しなきゃ」, still conveys urgency with
      the added 「よ」 particle. This register is often used when one friend gives a mild but firm warning
      to another about an impending event.
    etymology: '「終電」 (shūden) meaning ''last train'' combines 終 (shū: end) and 電 (den: electricity, short
      for 電車 densha - electric car), literally ''end electric train''.'
  - english: If you don't write it down, you'll forget it.
    japanese:

          - メモ し ない と、忘れ ちゃう よ。
        english: If you don't write it down, you'll forget it.
        hint: 「〜ないと」 is a very common informal conditional that often implies a negative consequence,
          and is frequently used colloquially. We're looking for the standard conditional structure.
      - competing_japanese:
          - メモ し なかっ たら、忘れ ちゃう よ。
        english: If you had not written it down, you would forget it.
        hint: 「〜なかったら」 emphasizes a hypothetical or past completed negative action, or a stronger sense
          of consequence tied to that non-action. We're looking for a general conditional for not doing
          something.
    scene: Someone giving advice to a forgetful friend.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「しなきゃ」 is the casual contraction, paired with 「忘れちゃう よ」, a casual contraction of 忘れてしまう. This
      creates a very natural and friendly tone, common among close friends. The particle 「よ」 adds a touch
      of emphasis and shared understanding.
    etymology: 「忘れちゃう」 (wasurechau) is a colloquial contraction of 忘れてしまう (wasurete shimau). The てしまう
      form often implies completion, or regret, but in casual speech can simply add emphasis to an action,
      here, the forgetting.
  - english: If you don't read the instructions, you won't understand how to use it.
    japanese:
      - 説明 書 を 読ま なけれ ば、使い 方 が 分かり ませ ん。

        english: If you don't read the instructions, you won't understand how to use it.
        hint: 「〜ないと」 is a common colloquial alternative, often used in similar contexts, but 「〜なければ」 maintains
          a slightly more formal or standard tone. We're looking for the standard conditional form.
    scene: A customer service representative explaining something to a customer.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: This is a polite and informative statement. The use of 「読まなければ」 sets a clear prerequisite,
      and 「分かりません」 maintains the polite register suitable for customer service. It's a straightforward
      conditional with a practical implication.
    etymology: '「説明書」 (setsumeisho) meaning ''instruction manual'' combines 説明 (setsumei: explanation)
      and 書 (sho: document, book), literally ''explanation document''.'
  - english: If you don't listen carefully, you'll miss the important parts.
    japanese:
      - よく 聞か なきゃ、大事 な ところ を 聞き逃し ちゃう よ。
      - よく 聞か なけれ ば、大事 な ところ を 聞き逃し ちゃう よ。
      - よく 聞か なけれ ば、大事 な ところ を 聞き逃し て しまい ます よ。

          - よく 聞か ない と、大事 な ところ を 聞き逃し ちゃう よ。
        english: If you don't listen carefully, you'll miss the important parts.
        hint: 「〜ないと」 is a common informal conditional often implying an undesirable outcome. It is frequently
          interchangeable with 「なきゃ」 in casual speech. We're looking for the standard conditional structure.
    scene: A senior student advising a junior student during a lecture.
    register: casual
    setting: academic
    nuance: The informal 「なきゃ」 is used here, fitting for advice given by an older student to a younger
      one. The contraction 「聞き逃しちゃう」 (from 聞き逃してしまう) reinforces the casual and slightly concerned tone
      about missing something important.
    etymology: '「聞き逃す」 (kikinogasu) meaning ''to miss hearing'' or ''to fail to catch what was said''
      combines 聞き (kiki: listening, from 聞く kiku) and 逃す (nogasu: to let slip, to miss). The ''miss''
      here refers to a missed opportunity for reception.'
  - english: If he doesn't apologize, I won't forgive him.
    japanese:
      - 彼 が 謝ら なきゃ、許さ ない。
      - 彼 が 謝ら なけれ ば、許さ ない。
      - 彼 が 謝ら なけれ ば、許し ませ ん。

          - 彼 が 謝ら ない と、許さ ない。
        english: If he doesn't apologize, I won't forgive him.
        hint: 「〜ないと」 is a common informal conditional, often used in similar contexts to express a negative
          consequence. We're looking for the standard conditional structure.
    scene: A person expressing their strong resolve.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: This sentence uses the plain negative conditional 「謝らなければ」 to express a firm condition. The
      plain form 「許さない」 reinforces the speaker's resolve and seriousness. This directness is common when
      expressing personal decisions in casual, yet serious, settings.
    etymology: 「許す」 (yurusu) meaning 'to forgive' or 'to permit' originally comes from 緩す (yurusu), meaning
      'to loosen' or 'to relax,' implying a release from a bond or obligation.
  - english: If you don't confirm, there might be a mistake later.
    japanese:
      - 確認 し なけれ ば、後 で 間違い が ある か も しれ ませ ん。
      - 確認 し なけれ ば、後 で 間違い が ある か も しれ ない。
    english_literally: If (you) don't confirm, later a mistake might exist.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 確認 し ない と、後 で 間違い が ある か も しれ ませ ん。
        english: If you don't confirm, there might be a mistake later.
        hint: 「〜ないと」 is a common conditional expressing that if something isn't done, a negative outcome
          will follow. It's often interchangeable in casual to semi-formal speech. We're looking for the
          standard conditional structure.
    scene: A mentor advising a mentee in a professional setting.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The polite 「しなければ」 is used for advice in a semi-formal context. The consequence 「間違いがあるかもしれません」
      uses a polite speculative ending. This careful phrasing is suitable for a mentor advising a mentee,
      indicating a potential negative outcome without being overly demanding.
    etymology: '「確認」 (kakunin) meaning ''confirmation'' or ''verification'' combines 確 (kaku: certain,
      firm) and 認 (nin: acknowledge, recognize), literally ''firmly acknowledge'' or ''certainly recognize''.'
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, Verb[なければ・なきゃ] is highly versatile for expressing negative
  conditions. The choice between the standard なければ and the casual なきゃ depends entirely on the formality
  of the situation and the relationship with your listener. Pay close attention to the context to select
  the most appropriate form. Mastering these forms allows for more nuanced and natural expression of conditional
  statements in Japanese.
