    "etymology": "The word 「ずっと」originally meant \"straight\" or \"in a straight line.\" Over time, it evolved to describe something that continues without deviation or interruption, hence its meaning of \"continuously\" or \"all the time.\"",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「ずっと」primarily indicates that something keeps going in a constant state, without stopping or resting. This grammar point focuses on this meaning.\n\nTo use 「ずっと」, place it before the verb or adjective you wish to emphasize as being ongoing. For instance, 「ずっと勉強しています」 (I have been studying continuously) highlights uninterrupted study.\n\nAlternatively, 「ずっと」can be combined with 「から」 (from/since) to specify a starting point for the continuous action or state. For example, 「子供 の 頃 から ずっと」 (ever since childhood) emphasizes continuity from a past event. This construction explicitly shows that something has been ongoing from a specific point in time up to the present.",

                    "mitigation": "「いつも」 implies habitual action (the cat always sleeps on the sofa) rather than an uninterrupted, ongoing state at a specific moment. The scene guides the learner to focus on the cat's current, continuous sleeping."

                {
                    "competing_grammar": "私 の 猫 は ソファ で 長時間 寝て いる。",
                    "mitigation": "「長時間」 emphasizes the long duration of sleep but doesn't necessarily imply that it's been continuous without any breaks or stirring. The scene helps to convey the 'uninterrupted' aspect of 'ずっと'."

                    "mitigation": "While grammatically correct, this phrasing simply states 'from childhood until now' without the added emphasis of 'ずっと' on the unwavering and uninterrupted nature of the affection for drawing. The scene implies a deep-rooted and constant passion."
