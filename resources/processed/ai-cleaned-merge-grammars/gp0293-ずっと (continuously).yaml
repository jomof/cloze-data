    "etymology": "The word 「ずっと」originally meant \"straight\" or \"in a straight line.\" Over time, it evolved to describe something that continues without deviation or interruption, hence its meaning of \"continuously\" or \"all the time.\"",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「ずっと」primarily indicates that something keeps going in a constant state, without stopping or resting. This grammar point focuses on this meaning.To use 「ずっと」, place it before the verb or adjective you wish to emphasize as being ongoing. For instance, 「ずっと勉強しています」 (I have been studying continuously) highlights uninterrupted study.Alternatively, 「ずっと」can be combined with 「から」 (from/since) to specify a starting point for the continuous action or state. For example, 「子供 の 頃 から ずっと」 (ever since childhood) emphasizes continuity from a past event. This construction explicitly shows that something has been ongoing from a specific point in time up to the present.",

            "nuance": "While 「ずっと」 can mean 'continuously,' it also has a separate meaning of 'by far' or 'much more' when comparing things (e.g., 「ずっと 良い」 - 'much better'). This second meaning emphasizes degree, not duration or continuity, and is distinct from the usage of 「ずっと」 in this grammar point."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusing these two meanings, consider the context. If 「ずっと」 is used to describe a continuous state or action, it refers to duration. If it's used with an adjective or adverb in a comparative sense, it likely indicates a significant difference in degree.",
