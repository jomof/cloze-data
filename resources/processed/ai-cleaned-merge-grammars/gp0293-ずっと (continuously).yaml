    "etymology": "The word 「ずっと」originally meant \"straight\" or \"in a straight line.\" Over time, it evolved to describe something that continues without deviation or interruption, hence its meaning of \"continuously\" or \"all the time.\"",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「ずっと」 has the primary meaning of indicating that something keeps going in a constant state, without stopping. It can also emphasize an amount of something, but here we will focus on the first meaning. To use 「ずっと」, add it to the beginning of the phrase that you want to highlight as being ongoing. Alternatively, 「ずっと」 can be used after 「から」 to express that something has been continuing \"ever since\" some specific event or point in time.",
