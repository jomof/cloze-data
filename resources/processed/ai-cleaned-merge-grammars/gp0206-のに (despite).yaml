    "etymology": "のに is derived from the particle の (a nominalizer, turning a phrase into a noun) and に (the particle indicating direction or purpose). Together, they create a sense of contrast or purpose that is not fulfilled.",
    "writeup": "The particle のに expresses a sense of **disappointment, surprise, or regret** that the expected result did not occur. It conveys the meaning of \"despite,\" \"although,\" or \"even though.\" It connects two clauses, where the second clause presents a situation that is unexpected or contrary to what one would assume based on the first clause.\n\n*   It can be used with verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns. When connecting to な-adjectives and nouns, the particle な is required between the noun/adjective and のに (e.g., 静かなのに, 学生なのに).\n*   While だのに exists, it is dialectical and generally considered incorrect in standard Japanese.\n\nIn the pattern of (A)のに, (B), (B) will be the result. Whether のに expresses \"in order to\" or \"despite\" depends on whether (B) is a logical conclusion of (A) or an illogical one.",
