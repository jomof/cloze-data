    "etymology": "のに originates from the particle の, which nominalizes a phrase, combined with the particle に, indicating a contrast or purpose. Over time, it evolved into a conjunction expressing unexpected results or circumstances.",
    "writeup": "のに expresses a sense of surprise or disappointment that the expected result did not occur. It conveys \"despite\" or \"even though.\" The basic structure is [clause 1] + のに + [clause 2], where clause 2 is contrary to what would be expected from clause 1.\n\nのに can also mean \"in order to\" when the result in clause 2 is a logical consequence of clause 1. However, this lesson primarily focuses on the \"despite\" nuance, which is used when clause 2 presents an illogical or unexpected outcome.\n\n*   **Connecting to different word types:**\n    *   Verbs and い-adjectives connect directly to のに using their plain form.\n    *   な-adjectives and nouns require な before のに. For example, 「静かなのに」 (despite being quiet) or 「雨なのに」 (despite the rain).\n\nWhile you might occasionally encounter だのに, especially in certain dialects, なのに is generally considered the standard and correct form when connecting to な-adjectives and nouns.",
