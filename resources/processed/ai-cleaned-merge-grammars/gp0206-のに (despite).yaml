        "usage-context": "Used to express that an unexpected outcome or situation occurs despite a preceding condition or fact. Often conveys surprise, disappointment, or mild criticism.",
        "function": "Connects two clauses, indicating that the second clause presents a result or situation contrary to what would be logically expected from the first clause.",
        "nuance": "Carries a nuance of surprise, disappointment, frustration, or a sense of 'it shouldn't be this way.' It highlights an unexpected or illogical contrast. Can sometimes imply a gentle reproach.",

        "logical-flow": "Indicates a counter-expected logical flow; premise (Clause 1) -> unexpected conclusion (Clause 2)"
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「のに」 originates from the nominalizing particle 「の」, which turns a preceding clause into a noun phrase, combined with the particle 「に」, which indicates a contrast or purpose. This construction evolved to express a situation where an outcome is contrary to what would be expected from the preceding condition or reason. The core idea is that something happens 'in relation to' (に) a prior state (の), but in an unexpected way.",
    "writeup": "「のに」 expresses a sense of surprise or disappointment that the expected result did not occur. It conveys \"despite\" or \"even though.\" The basic structure is [clause 1] + 「のに」 + [clause 2], where clause 2 is contrary to what would be expected from clause 1.「のに」 can also mean \"in order to\" when the result in clause 2 is a logical consequence of clause 1. However, this lesson primarily focuses on the \"despite\" nuance, which is used when clause 2 presents an illogical or unexpected outcome.For connecting to different word types: verbs and い-adjectives connect directly to 「のに」 using their plain form.な-adjectives and nouns require 「な」 before 「のに」. For example, 「静かなのに」 (despite being quiet) or 「雨なのに」 (despite the rain).While you might occasionally encounter 「だのに」, especially in certain dialects, 「なのに」 is generally considered the standard and correct form when connecting to な-adjectives and nouns.",
