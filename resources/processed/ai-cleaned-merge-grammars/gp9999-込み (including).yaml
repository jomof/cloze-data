pronunciation:
  katakana: コミ
  romaji: komi
formation:
  Noun + 込み: Indicates that the preceding noun is included or integrated.
  Verb-stem + 込み: Adds the nuance of 'into,' 'deeply,' 'fully,' or 'packed with' to the action of the
    verb.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The suffix 「込み」 originates from the verb 込む (komu), which means 'to be crowded,' 'to be put
  into,' 'to go into,' or 'to be filled.' This core meaning of 'entering' or 'filling' extended to imply
  'inclusion' when used with nouns (e.g., 税込み 'tax included,' literally 'tax-filled'), and 'deeply' or
  'thoroughly' when affixed to verb stems (e.g., 飛び込む 'to jump in deeply,' 詰め込む 'to cram in thoroughly').
  The evolution reflects a semantic shift from physical entry or containment to abstract inclusion or
  the thoroughness of an action.
writeup: |-
  The Japanese grammar point 「込み」 is a versatile element that functions primarily as a suffix, adding specific nuances to nouns and verb stems. When attached to a noun, 「込み」 often means "including" or "with something included." This is commonly seen in contexts such as pricing, where it specifies that taxes, service charges, or other fees are already part of the total cost. For example, 「税込み」 (zeikomi) means "tax included," and 「サービス料込み」 (sābisu-ryō komi) means "service charge included." In these cases, 「込み」 indicates that the preceding item is intrinsically part of the whole.

  When 「込み」 is attached to the stem form of a verb, it adds a nuance of an action being performed "into" something, "deeply," or "thoroughly." It suggests completeness or integration of the action. For instance, 「飛び込む」 (tobikomu) means "to jump into" (implying deeply into water or a situation), and 「詰め込む」 (tsumekomu) means "to cram in" or "to stuff thoroughly." Many common verbs are formed this way, such as 「申し込む」 (mōshikomu, to apply, literally "to state into"), 「書き込む」 (kakikomu, to write into/fill in), and 「練り込む」 (nerikomu, to knead thoroughly or to incorporate/infuse).

  Understanding the context is key to grasping the precise meaning of 「込み」. While it consistently conveys a sense of inclusion or thoroughness, its specific interpretation depends heavily on whether it follows a noun or a verb stem, and the nature of the preceding word.
false_friends:
  - term: 含む (fukumu)
    meaning: to include, to contain
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「含む」 is a verb that means to generally include or contain. It is a direct action. 「〜込み」, on
      the other hand, is a suffix that forms a new compound word or expression, often implying that something
      is already inherently included or thoroughly integrated.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:含む (to include)
  - term: 含めて (fukumete)
    meaning: including (te-form of 含む)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「含む」, 「含めて」 explicitly states that something is being included in a list or consideration.
      「〜込み」 is more about a fixed state of inclusion, like in a price, or the thoroughness of an action.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:含む (to include)
  - term: と共に (to tomo ni)
    meaning: together with
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「と共に」 emphasizes accompaniment or being side-by-side with something. 「〜込み」 implies that something
      is an intrinsic part or deeply integrated, not just coexisting.
    grammar_point: と共に (together with)
  - term: 入る (hairu)
    meaning: to enter
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「入る」 is the general verb for entering. When 「込み」 is attached to a verb stem (e.g., 飛び込み),
      it adds a nuance of the action being done 'deeply into' or 'fully contained within,' which is more
      specific than simply 'entering'.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:入る (to enter)
  - term: いっぱい (ippai)
    meaning: full; a lot
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「いっぱい」 describes a state of being full or a large quantity. While 「込み」 can imply 'packed with,'
      it refers to the process or result of filling/integrating, not just the state of fullness.
    grammar_point: いっぱい (full・a lot)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「込み」 can sometimes overlap in meaning with words like 「含む」 or 「入る」,
  it's important to recognize its specific role as a suffix. When used after a noun, it often implies
  an intrinsic or inherent inclusion, especially in commercial or descriptive contexts (e.g., 「税込み」, meaning
  tax is already part of the price). This differs from 「含む」, which is a transitive verb indicating an
  active act of including something. Similarly, when attached to a verb stem, 「込み」 emphasizes a thoroughness,
  depth, or completion of an action that simply using the base verb like 「入る」 might not convey.
examples:
  - english: The price includes tax.
    japanese:
      - 値段 は {税込み} です。
      - 値段 は {税込み} で ござい ます。
      - 値段 は {税込み} だ。
    english_literally: The price is tax-included.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 税金 を 含む 値段 です。
        english: The price that includes tax.
        hint: 「含む」 is a verb for general inclusion, while 「税込み」 is a common fixed expression specifically
          for prices with tax already included. We're looking for the fixed expression here.
    scene: A customer is asking about the final cost of an item.

      - 私 は {詰め込み} 教育 が 苦手 です。
      - 僕 は {詰め込み} 教育 が 苦手 だ。
      - '{詰め込み} 教育 は 私 に は 苦手 です。'
    english_literally: As for me, cramming education is not my strong point.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 覚える の が 苦手 です。
        english: I am not good at memorizing things.
        hint: This is about general memorization, not specifically 'cramming' for a test or task. We're
          looking for the specific concept of cramming.
    scene: A student is discussing their study habits with a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: academic
    nuance: 「詰め込み」 specifically refers to the act of cramming or stuffing information, implying a less
      effective, superficial method of learning, rather than just 'memorizing'.
  - english: He's quick to grasp things, so he learns fast.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は {飲み込み} が 早い の で、覚える の が 速い です。
      - 彼 は {飲み込み} が 早い から、覚える の が 速い です。
      - 彼 は {飲み込み} が 早い から、覚える の が 速い ね。
    english_literally: As for him, understanding is fast, so learning is quick.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 理解 が 早い の で、覚える の が 速い です。
        english: He understands quickly, so he learns fast.
        hint: This focuses on 'understanding' in general, not the specific idiomatic expression 'quick
          to grasp' using 「飲み込み」. We're looking for the idiomatic phrase here.
    scene: Two colleagues are discussing a new team member's learning ability.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「飲み込みが早い」 (nomikomi ga hayai) is an idiomatic expression that literally means 'quick to swallow/take
      in,' metaphorically meaning 'quick to grasp' or 'quick to understand.' 「飲み込み」 here encapsulates
      the act of fully taking in information.

          - それ は 君 の 勘違い だ よ。
        english: That's just your misunderstanding.
        hint: 「勘違い」 is a simple misunderstanding, while 「思い込み」 implies a strong, potentially stubborn,
          belief that may not be true. We're looking for the nuance of a fixed, possibly mistaken, belief.
    scene: A friend correcting another friend's mistaken belief.
