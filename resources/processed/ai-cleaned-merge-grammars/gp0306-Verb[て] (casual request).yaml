        "usage-context": "General",
        "function": "Expresses a casual request or mild command.",
        "nuance": "Softer than a direct imperative, but can still sound demanding if tone or context is inappropriate. Implies a close relationship between speaker and listener. Also used when speaker is thinking or for apologies, but the core meaning of this grammar point is the casual request."
    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point is a shortened, casual form of the 「〜てください」 construction. 「〜て」 is the te-form of the verb, which is used in a variety of grammatical constructions, but in this case it functions as a softened imperative.",
    "writeup": "The grammatical construction **Verb[て]** serves as a casual request or a mild command in Japanese. It is a shortened form of the more polite **Verb[て]ください**. While often friendly, its directness means it is best used among close friends, family members, or towards individuals of lower status. The nuance of **Verb[て]** as a request is typically identifiable when it appears at the end of a sentence.\n\nFor negative requests, the form **Verb[ないで]** is used, which is the te-form of the negative plain form of the verb (Verb[ない]). Similar to its positive counterpart, **Verb[ないで]** is a casual way to say \"please don't (verb)\" or \"don't (verb)\".\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **Context is Key**: While generally casual, the tone and specific context can significantly alter the perceived politeness. A direct **Verb[て]** can sound demanding if used inappropriately with someone of higher status or a stranger.\n*   **Distinguishing from Other Te-forms**: It is crucial to differentiate this request form from other uses of the te-form. For example, the te-form is also used to connect clauses (e.g., 「走って、止まる」 - \"run and stop\"), to indicate an ongoing action (e.g., 「食べている」 - \"is eating\"), or to express a reason (e.g., 「遅くなって、ごめん」 - \"Sorry for being late\"). When used for a casual request, the te-form stands alone at the end of the sentence.\n*   **Hesitation/Thinking**: Sometimes, the te-form might appear at the end of a sentence when the speaker has not finished their thought or is pausing. In such cases, the pronunciation of the **て** is often extended to signal a pause for thought, rather than a request.",
