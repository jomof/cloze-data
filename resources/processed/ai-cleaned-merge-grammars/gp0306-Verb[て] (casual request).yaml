    "etymology": "This grammar point is a shortened, casual form of the 「〜てください」 construction. 「〜て」 is the te-form of the verb, which is used in a variety of grammatical constructions, but in this case it functions as a softened imperative.",
    "writeup": "In casual speech, 「〜てください」 is often shortened to 「〜て」. This usually comes across as a friendly way to say \"please do (A),\" but it can also sound like a soft order, so it is best used with friends or toward people of lower status. The nuance of 「〜て」 as a request is usually identifiable by its appearance at the end of a sentence. It's also important to distinguish this from the 「て」-form used to connect clauses. When emphasizing an apology, 「〜て」 may also be used, attached to the 'reason' for the apology, and can be either positive or negative.",
