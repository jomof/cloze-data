    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the te-form of a verb. In this context, it's a shortened version of the more polite 「～てください」.",
    "writeup": "The 「～て」 form of a verb, when used at the end of a sentence, serves as a casual way of making a request or giving a soft command. It's essentially a shortened version of 「～てください」, which is more polite. Because of its less formal nature, it's **best used with friends, family, or people of lower status**. Using it with someone of higher status could come across as rude or demanding.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   The nuance can range from a friendly request to a mild order, depending on the context and tone.\n*   Sometimes, 「～て」 appears at the end of a sentence when the speaker hasn't finished their thought. In these cases, the 「て」 sound is often drawn out to indicate the speaker is still thinking.\n*   「～て」 can also be used when emphasizing an apology, attached to the reason for the apology.",
