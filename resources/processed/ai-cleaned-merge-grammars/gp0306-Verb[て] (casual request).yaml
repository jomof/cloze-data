jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: General
  function: Expresses a casual request or mild command.
  nuance: Softer than a direct imperative, but can still sound demanding if tone or context is inappropriate.
    Implies a close relationship between speaker and listener. Also used when speaker is thinking or for
    apologies, but the core meaning of this grammar point is the casual request.
etymology: This grammar point is a shortened, casual form of the 「〜てください」 construction. 「〜て」 is the te-form
  of the verb, which is used in a variety of grammatical constructions, but in this case it functions
  as a softened imperative.
writeup: |-
  The grammatical construction **Verb[て]** serves as a casual request or a mild command in Japanese. It is a shortened form of the more polite **Verb[て]ください**. While often friendly, its directness means it is best used among close friends, family members, or towards individuals of lower status. The nuance of **Verb[て]** as a request is typically identifiable when it appears at the end of the sentence.

  For negative requests, the form **Verb[ないで]** is used, which is the te-form of the negative plain form of the verb (Verb[ない]). Similar to its positive counterpart, **Verb[ないで]** is a casual way to say "please don't (verb)" or "don't (verb)".

  **Important Considerations:**
  *   **Context is Key**: While generally casual, the tone and specific context can significantly alter the perceived politeness. A direct **Verb[て]** can sound demanding if used inappropriately with someone of higher status or a stranger.
  *   **Distinguishing from Other Te-forms**: It is crucial to differentiate this request form from other uses of the te-form. For example, the te-form is also used to connect clauses (e.g., 「走って、止まる」 - "run and stop"), to indicate an ongoing action (e.g., 「食べている」 - "is eating"), or to express a reason (e.g., 「遅くなって、ごめん」 - "Sorry for being late"). When used for a casual request, the te-form stands alone at the end of the sentence.
  *   **Hesitation/Thinking**: Sometimes, the te-form might appear at the end of a sentence when the speaker has not finished their thought or is pausing. In such cases, the pronunciation of the **て** is often extended to signal a pause for thought, rather than a request.
false_friends:
  - term: てください
    meaning: Please do (Polite request)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike **Verb[て]**, **てください** is a polite request form and is suitable for use with superiors
      or people you don't know well.
    grammar_point: てください (polite request)
  - term: ないでください
    meaning: Please don't do (polite request)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: This is the polite equivalent of **Verb[ないで]**, suitable for more formal contexts.
    grammar_point: ないでください (please don't)
  - term: Verb[て] (and then)
    meaning: And, Then (Linking events)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike **Verb[て]** (casual request), the **て**-form to link events does not appear at the
      end of the sentence. Instead, it connects two or more clauses together.
    grammar_point: Verb[て] (and then)
  - term: Imperative (command form)
    meaning: Command or strong request.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The imperative form is a much stronger and often harsher direct command, whereas **Verb[て]**
      offers a softer, more casual request.
    grammar_point: Imperative (command form)
  - term: なさい (polite imperative)
    meaning: Do (something)! (Polite imperative)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「なさい」 is a command often used by those in authority (e.g., parents to children) with a polite
      tone, implying expectation or instruction. **Verb[て]** is a request that relies on relationship
      rather than authority.
    grammar_point: なさい (polite imperative)
  - term: Verb[て] + ごらん
    meaning: Gentle suggestion ("Why don't you try...")
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Adding 「ごらん」 softens the command, turning it into a gentle suggestion or invitation to 'try
      and see' something, rather than a direct request for the action itself.
    grammar_point: Verb[て] + ごらん (gentle suggestion)
post_false_friends_writeup: It's important to differentiate between **Verb[て]** as a casual request and
  its other uses. When used to connect clauses, it will not be at the end of the sentence. While 「てください」
  and 「ないでください」 are more polite, they can sound overly formal in casual situations with close friends.
  On the other hand, using **Verb[て]** with people you don't know well or those in positions of authority
  can come across as rude or presumptuous. The direct imperative forms like 「なさい」 or the plain command
  form are much stronger and should be used with care, as they convey a sense of authority or urgency
  that **Verb[て]** lacks. The use of 「ごらん」 with the te-form is distinct as it provides a gentler suggestion,
  inviting action rather than commanding it.

    scene: A frustrated parent tells their impulsive child to think before acting.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「ちゃんと」 means "properly" or "carefully." The 「て」-form 「考えて」 is a direct, emphatic request or
      command in a moment of frustration. The lack of 「ください」 makes it stark.

    scene: A friend asks another to play a song or tell them something interesting.

    setting: friendly
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: 「聞かせて」 is the causative 「聞く」 (to hear) in the 「て」-form, meaning "make (me) hear" or "let (me)

    scene: A coach directs a child during a sports practice.
    register: casual
    setting: instructional
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「行って」 is the 「て」-form of 「行く」 (to go). Used here as a direct, casual instruction from an older
      person (coach) to a younger person (child).

  it's generally considered more casual and friendly than **Verb[て]ください**. The speaker's relationship
  with the listener plays a significant role in how the request is perceived.
