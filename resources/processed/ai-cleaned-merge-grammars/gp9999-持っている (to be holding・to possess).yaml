formation:
  Verb (持つ) + ている: To express the continuous action of holding or the resultant state of possessing.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The grammar point 「持っている」 combines the verb 「持つ」 (motsu), meaning "to hold," "to have," or
  "to possess," with the auxiliary verb construction 「〜ている」 (te iru). The 「〜ている」 form originally signified
  an ongoing action (progressive). However, for verbs like 「持つ」 that describe a change of state or an
  instantaneous action, the 「〜ている」 form often signifies the resultant state of that action. In the case
  of 「持つ」, 「持っている」 thus conveys the state of having or possessing something, which is a result of having
  taken hold of it. It can also imply the ongoing action of holding something. This dual interpretation
  arises from the versatile nature of the 「〜ている」 form in Japanese.
writeup: |-
  The Japanese verb 「持つ」 (motsu) translates to "to hold," "to carry," or "to have/possess." When conjugated into the 「〜ている」 form, as in 「持っている」 (motte iru), it expresses two primary meanings: a continuous action of holding something, or a resultant state of possessing something.

  The first meaning, "to be holding" or "to be carrying," indicates an ongoing physical action. For example, if someone is actively holding a book in their hands, you would say 「本 を {持っている}」. This emphasizes the immediate physical act.

  The second and very common meaning is "to possess" or "to own." This refers to a state of having something, regardless of whether it is physically in one's hands at that moment. For instance, if you own a car, you would say 「車 を {持っている}」, even if the car is parked in your garage and you are not currently driving it. This usage describes a long-term or general state of possession.

  It's crucial to understand the context to differentiate these two uses. Generally, if the object is something that can be actively held, the meaning can be either. If the object is something that one "owns" but doesn't constantly hold (like a house, a skill, or a passport), it almost always refers to possession.
false_friends:
  - term: ある
    meaning: to exist (inanimate), to have (for inanimate objects, no implication of personal possession
      or holding)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「ある」 indicates the existence of an inanimate object or a general "having" without implying
      a personal connection or active holding. 「{持っている}」 implies personal possession or active holding.
    grammar_point: ある (to exist, inanimate・to have)
  - term: いる
    meaning: to exist (animate)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「いる」 indicates the existence of an animate object. It is not used for possessing inanimate
      objects. 「{持っている}」 is specifically for possessing inanimate objects or holding any object.
    grammar_point: いる (to exist, animate)
  - term: Verb[ている・てる]
    meaning: expresses ongoing action or resultant state
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While `持っている` uses the `〜ている` form, many `〜ている` forms indicate a continuous action (e.g.,
      走っている - "is running"). For `持つ`, `持っている` often emphasizes the resultant state of possession rather
      than purely a continuous action of holding. This is a common pattern for verbs that describe an
      instantaneous change of state.
    grammar_point: Verb[ている・てる] (progressive・resultative)
post_false_friends_writeup: The distinction between `持っている`, `ある`, and `いる` can be subtle. While `ある`
  and `いる` primarily indicate existence (for inanimate and animate things, respectively), `持っている` specifically
  denotes possession or the active state of holding. You would use 「私は車を{持っている}」 (I own a car) for possession,
  but 「ここに車がある」 (There is a car here) to simply state its existence. Similarly, for animate objects, 「犬が庭にいる」
  (There is a dog in the garden) states existence, whereas `持っている` is not typically used for animate "possession"
  in the same way (e.g., you wouldn't say 「私は犬を{持っている}」 unless you're literally holding the dog). It's
  more common to use verbs like 「飼っている」 (to be raising/keeping a pet). Remember that `持っている` always implies
  a connection of having or holding by a person or entity.
