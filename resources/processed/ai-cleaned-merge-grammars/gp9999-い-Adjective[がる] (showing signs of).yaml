pronunciation:
  katakana: イーアジェクティブ ガル
  romaji: i-adjective garu
formation:
  い-Adjective stem + がる: 'Used for i-adjectives to express that someone is showing external signs of feeling
    that way (e.g., 悲しがる: to show signs of sadness).'
  寒い -> 寒がる: When you observe someone acting cold, shivering, etc., you say they are 'showing signs of
    being cold'.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The suffix 「がる」 (garu) originates from the classical Japanese verb 「がる」(garu), which meant
  'to have the tendency to do' or 'to act as if'. Over time, its usage specialized to indicate the outward
  manifestation of an internal state or emotion, particularly when describing others. This is because
  one can directly state their own feelings (e.g., 悲しい desu), but for others, one must infer their feelings
  from their behavior, leading to the use of 「がる」.
writeup: |-
  The grammar pattern 「い-Adjective[がる]」 is used to describe when someone is **showing external signs** of a feeling or state that is typically expressed by an い-adjective. The core verb 「がる」 attaches to the **stem** of an い-adjective.

  For example, from 「悲しい」 (kanashii - sad), you remove the 「い」 to get the stem 「悲し」 (kanashi), and then add 「がる」 to form 「悲しがる」 (kanashigaru - to show signs of sadness). Similarly, from 「寒い」 (samui - cold), you get 「寒がる」 (samugaru - to show signs of being cold).

  **Important Considerations:**

  1.  **Observing Others:** This grammar point is almost exclusively used when **observing the feelings or states of a third party**. You would not typically use 「がる」 to describe your own feelings, as you know your own feelings directly. For instance, you would say 「私は悲しいです」 (I am sad), not 「私は悲しがります」.

  2.  **Inference, Not Direct Knowledge:** The use of 「がる」 implies that you are **inferring** the person's feelings from their outward behavior, actions, or expressions, rather than knowing their internal state directly. For example, if a child is shivering and complaining about the cold, you might say 「子供が寒がっている」 (The child is showing signs of being cold/acting cold).

  3.  **Transformation to a Verb:** When 「がる」 is attached to an い-adjective stem, the resulting phrase functions as a Godan verb (五段動詞), meaning it conjugates like other Godan verbs (e.g., 「読む」 - yomu).

  While 「がる」 can also attach to な-adjectives (e.g., 「嫌い」 → 「嫌がる」 - to show aversion, to dislike doing) and the desiderative 「〜たい」 (e.g., 「行きたい」 → 「行きたがる」 - to show signs of wanting to go), this specific grammar point focuses on its application with い-adjectives.

  - term: な-Adjective[がる]
    meaning: To show signs of a na-adjective state or aversion (e.g., 嫌がる - to dislike doing).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both `い-Adjective[がる]` and `な-Adjective[がる]` express outward signs of an internal state,
      this specific grammar point refers only to い-adjectives. `な-Adjective[がる]` applies to adjectival
      nouns.
    grammar_point: '[い-Adjective-stem]がる・[な-Adjective]がる (to show signs of feeling)'
  - term: '[Verb-stem・Adj-stem]そうだ'
    meaning: It seems, it looks like (based on direct visual observation or hearsay).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`〜そうだ` describes an appearance or an objective observation of a state, and can apply to inanimate
      objects or situations. `い-Adjective[がる]` is specifically used for observing another''s *internal*
      emotional or physical state, inferred from their behavior.'
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]・[い-Adjective-stem]・[な-Adjective]そうだ (it seems・looks like)'
  - term: '[Verb-ます-stem]たがる'
    meaning: To show signs of wanting to do something (referring to a third person).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is a specific application of `がる` attached to the desiderative `〜たい`. While `がる` itself
      indicates showing signs of an adjective-derived state, `〜たがる` is specifically about showing signs
      of *desire* for an action.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Verb-ます-stem]たがる (to show signs of wanting to do)
  - term: '[i-Adj-stem]み'
    meaning: A suffix that forms a noun from an i-adjective, indicating the abstract quality itself (e.g.,
      悲しみ - sadness).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`〜み` creates a noun representing the abstract quality (e.g., 悲しみ - sadness). `い-Adjective[がる]`
      describes the *action* of showing that quality through behavior.'
    grammar_point: な-Adjective[み] (abstract quality)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing 「い-Adjective[がる]」 from similar expressions, remember that
  「がる」 focuses on the *behavioral manifestation* of an emotional or physical state in a third party. It's
  particularly useful when direct communication of feelings is not possible or not the focus. In contrast,
  「〜そう」 describes an *appearance* or a direct observation that can apply more broadly to situations or
  objects, not just internal states. For example, a house can look `古そう` (old-looking) but not `古がる`.
  The construction 「〜たがる」 is a specific instance of 「がる」, indicating the outward signs of someone's *desire*
  to perform an action. Lastly, the suffix 「〜み」 forms a noun representing the abstract *quality* itself,
  rather than the act of displaying it.
examples:
  - english: The child is showing signs of being cold, perhaps because the window is open.
    japanese:
      - 窓 が 開い て いる せい か、子供 が {寒 がっ て いる}。
      - 窓 が 開い て いる せい か、子供 が {寒 がっ て い ます}。
      - 窓 開い てる せい か、子供 {寒 がっ てる} なぁ。
    english_literally: Window is open, because of that, child is showing signs of being cold.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 子供 が 寒い と 言っ て いる。
        english: The child is saying they are cold.

    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)

    nuance: The use of 「寒がっている」 implies the mother is inferring the child's coldness from their behavior
      (e.g., shivering, hugging themselves), not because the child explicitly stated it. The phrase 「窓
      が 開いている せい か」 adds context that the coldness is a perceived consequence of the open window.

      a slight annoyance from the speaker.

      its fear is inferred from its actions. It's often used for animals or young children whose internal
      feelings cannot be verbalized.

          simple statement. We're describing an ongoing behavioral pattern.
    scene: Two colleagues are discussing a mutual acquaintance.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    speaker_gender: male

    scene: A frustrated friend discussing another friend's immaturity.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female

        english: They say that puppy is lonely when left alone.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 試験 中、多く の 学生 が 緊張 し て い た。
        english: During the exam, many students were tense.
        hint: While `緊張していた` (were tense) describes their state, `緊張しがっていた` describes their *observable
          behavior* (e.g., fidgeting, biting nails) that indicates their tension. We're looking for the
          outward manifestation.
    scene: An observer describing the atmosphere during a difficult test.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    nuance: While 「緊張しがっていた」 might seem like it should be 「緊張していた」 (from 緊張する, a する verb), sometimes い-adjectives
      are formed from nouns + する where the noun describes a feeling that can be *displayed*. Here, 「緊張しがっていた」
      means they were *visibly* showing their nervousness (e.g., fidgeting, sweating, shaking), not just
      being nervous internally. This usage highlights the observable signs of their tension during the
      exam.
post_example_writeup: As illustrated in the examples, 「い-Adjective[がる]」 is a powerful tool for describing
  the inferred emotional or physical states of others based on their observable behaviors. It's particularly
  useful when direct communication of feelings is not possible or not the focus. Pay close attention to
  the stem form of the い-adjective and the standard verb conjugations of 「がる」.
