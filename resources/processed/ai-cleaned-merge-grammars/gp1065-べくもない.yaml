    "etymology": "「べくもない」 comes from 「べし」, an old auxiliary verb expressing obligation or possibility, combined with 「も」 (also, even) and 「ない」 (not). The combination indicates that something is so impossible that it's not even worth considering.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「べくもない」 is a formal expression indicating impossibility or the complete lack of hope for something. It's derived from the classical auxiliary verb 「べし」, which conveys purpose, necessity, or likelihood. When combined with 「も」 and 「ない」, it creates a strong sense of negation. It's often used with verbs related to thinking or emotions, emphasizing the speaker's conviction that something is inconceivable or unattainable. For 「する」, 「すべくもない」 or 「するべくもない」 are both acceptable.",
