        "Usage": "Used in formal writing and speech."

    "etymology": "「べくもない」 is formed from the conjunctive form (連用形) of the classical auxiliary verb 「べし」, which expressed strong likelihood or necessity. This is combined with the adverbial particle 「も」 (meaning 'even' or 'also') and the negative adjective 「ない」. The combination powerfully negates the possibility, indicating that something is so utterly impossible or out of the question that it's not even worth contemplating.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「べくもない」 is a formal and often literary expression used to convey strong impossibility or a complete lack of hope for something. It emphasizes that a particular action, thought, or outcome is utterly inconceivable or unattainable from the speaker's perspective. It is frequently paired with verbs that relate to cognitive processes or emotions, such as doubting (疑う), knowing (知る), comparing (比べる), or hoping (望む). For verbs ending in 「する」, both 「すべくもない」 and the more classical 「するべくもない」 forms are grammatically acceptable, though 「すべくもない」 often sounds more natural in this construction.",
