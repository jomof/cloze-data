    "etymology": "「べくもない」is derived from the classical auxiliary verb 「べし」, which expresses obligation, suitability, or possibility. Adding 「も」 and 「ない」 to 「べし」 creates a strong negation, indicating impossibility or lack of expectation.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「べくもない」 is a structure indicating that something is **impossible**, **inconceivable**, or **beyond hope**. It's derived from the classical auxiliary verb 「べし」, often used to express purpose, necessity, or likelihood. When combined with 「も」 and 「ない」, it forms a strong negation. This pattern frequently accompanies verbs related to thought or emotion, emphasizing the speaker's conviction that a certain action is out of the question.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   This expression is considered formal and somewhat literary. You'll encounter it more often in writing or formal speech.\n*   When used with 「する」, 「べく」 can attach directly to 「する」 or its stem, 「す」.",

        {
            "japanese": "自分が作ったパスタはあの有名なシェフが作るパスタと比べる**べくもない**が、結構おいしいと思う。",
            "english": "It is impossible to compare the pasta I made with the pasta made by that famous chef, but I think mine is quite good.",
            "register": "semi-formal",
            "setting": "reflective",
            "conjugation": "dictionary (plain non-past)",
            "nuance": "This is 「semi-formal」 due to the 「思う」 and overall tone of the sentence, which is more akin to writing than speaking. There's nothing specifically gendered or age-related about the language used."
        },
        {
            "japanese": "あの顔を見てみろ、あいつが彼を殺したということは疑う**べくもない**。",
            "english": "Look at that face; there is no doubt that they are the one that killed him.",
            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "serious",
            "conjugation": "dictionary (plain non-past)",
            "nuance": "「カジュアル」because of 「みてみろ」and the somewhat blunt tone. The speaker is directly stating something that they are absolutely certain of, so the register of 「カジュアル」 is suitable here. The rest of the sentence uses neutral language."
        },
        {
            "japanese": "私自身が先生になるまでは、先生の大変さなど知る**べくもなかった**。",
            "english": "Until I became a teacher myself, I could never have known how hard it is to be a teacher.",
            "register": "semi-formal",
            "setting": "reflective",
            "conjugation": "negative past (plain)",
            "nuance": "The 「semi-formal」 register comes from the mature topic, the reflective tone, and the use of 「まで」 instead of a more casual alternative."
        },
        {
            "japanese": "あの中古車販売店が詐欺まがいなことをやっていたということは、否定する**べくもない**事実だ。",

            "setting": "informative",
            "conjugation": "dictionary (plain non-past)",
            "nuance": "The 「formal」 register comes from the sophisticated topic, 「詐欺」, and the expression 「否定するべくもない事実」. It implies a professional or academic setting rather than casual conversation."

            "japanese": "そんな解決策では問題が解決する**べくもない**。",

            "setting": "serious",
            "conjugation": "dictionary (plain non-past)",
            "etymology": "「ゆえ」is an archaic expression, so it would fit the description of 「bungo」",
            "nuance": "This sounds like something from a novel, hence the 「bungo」, or literary register. The 「ゆえ」 is an archaic phrase, so this sentence would only appear in writing."

        {
            "japanese": "いくら頑張ったところで、絵は写真にはおよぶ**べくもない**のである。",
