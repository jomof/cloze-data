        "する動詞 (verbs ending in する) + すべくもない / するべくもない": "Both forms are acceptable for する verbs, with すべくもない being more formal or classical. This indicates impossibility for する verbs."

    "meaning": "There is no way; it is impossible; not a hope in hell",
    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Primarily used in formal writing and speech, often in literary contexts."
    },
    "etymology": "「べくもない」 is formed from the conjunctive form (連用形) of the classical auxiliary verb 「べし」, which expressed strong likelihood or necessity. This is combined with the adverbial particle 「も」 (meaning 'even' or 'also') and the negative adjective 「ない」. The combination powerfully negates the possibility, indicating that something is so utterly impossible or out of the question that it's not even worth contemplating.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「べくもない」 is a formal and often literary expression used to convey strong impossibility or a complete lack of hope for something. It emphasizes that a particular action, thought, or outcome is utterly inconceivable or unattainable from the speaker's perspective. It is frequently paired with verbs that relate to cognitive processes or emotions, such as doubting (疑う), knowing (知る), comparing (比べる), or hoping (望む). For verbs ending in 「する」, both 「すべくもない」 and the more classical 「するべくもない」 forms are grammatically acceptable, though 「すべくもない」 often sounds more natural in this construction.",

            "japanese": "彼 の 言い訳 を 聞いて、その 嘘 を 許す {べくもない} と 感じた。",
            "english": "After hearing his excuse, I felt that it was impossible to forgive his lie.",
            "scene": "A person reflecting on a deeply disappointing and unforgivable act by someone else.",
            "register": "formal",
            "setting": "serious",
            "conjugation": "negative plain (～ない)",
            "nuance": "The phrase 「許すべくもない」 strongly emphasizes the fundamental impossibility of forgiveness due to the nature of the lie, suggesting that forgiveness is not merely difficult, but inherently out of the question. This carries a heavier weight than a simple inability to forgive.",
            "etymology": "「言い訳」 (iiwake) means 'excuse', and 「嘘」 (uso) means 'lie'."
        },
        {
            "japanese": "当時の 私 に は、その 計画 の 危険 性 を 理解 する {べくもなかった} 。",
            "english": "At that time, it was impossible for me to understand the danger of that plan.",
            "scene": "An older, wiser person reflecting on a past event where they lacked foresight or understanding.",
            "register": "semi-formal",

            "conjugation": "negative past plain (～なかった)",
            "speaker_age": "older",
            "nuance": "The past tense form 「べくもなかった」 highlights a profound past inability to comprehend, implying that understanding was inherently beyond the speaker's capacity at that specific time. This often suggests a realization gained only through later experience or maturity, as conveyed by 「当時の私には」 (at that time, for me).",
            "etymology": "「危険性」 (kiken sei) means 'danger' or 'riskiness'."

            "setting": "informative",
            "conjugation": "negative plain (～ない)",
            "nuance": "「比べるべくもない」 here conveys that a comparison is utterly pointless or inappropriate due to a vast disparity in skill or quality. It is a strong assertion of superiority, making the idea of comparing them to others inherently absurd, beyond a simple inability to compare.",
            "etymology": "「圧倒的」 (attouteki) means 'overwhelming' or 'dominant', and 「才能」 (sainou) means 'talent'."

            "setting": "professional",
            "conjugation": "negative plain (～ない)",
            "nuance": "The use of 「期待するべくもない」 suggests that expecting a simple solution is not only unlikely but fundamentally unrealistic given the complexity of the problem. It carries a tone of pragmatic resignation, indicating that such an expectation would be futile.",
            "etymology": "「複雑」 (fukuzatsu) means 'complex', and 「解決策」 (kaiketsusaku) means 'solution'."

            "etymology": "「罪」 (tsumi) means 'crime' or 'guilt', and 「明らかになる」 (akiraka ni naru) means 'to become clear' or 'to come to light'."

The simple negative form 「〜ない」 indicates a direct inability, whereas 「べくもない」 conveys a deeper, more inherent impossibility.",
