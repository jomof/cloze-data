    "etymology": "The verb 「めく」 stems from the classical Japanese verb 「見ゆ (みゆ)」, meaning \"to be seen\" or \"to appear\". Over time, 「見ゆ」 evolved to express the idea of something starting to show a certain characteristic or appearance, leading to the development of 「めく」. The 「めいた」 form is simply the past tense adjectival form of 「めく」.",
    "writeup": "「めく」 is a unique う-verb in Japanese that primarily functions as a suffix. It conveys the meaning of \"to show signs of (A)\" or \"to have the appearance of (A)\", where (A) is a noun. It's attached to nouns, reflecting the speaker's subjective perception. As 「めく」 is a verb, it can be conjugated. When directly modifying another noun, the past-tense form 「めいた」 is commonly used.\n\nThe key aspect of 「めく」 is that it highlights the speaker's personal feelings and perception. Often, the described thing is not actually (A), and the speaker is aware of this. 「めく」 is often used with set nouns, so it is best to use it with expressions that you have already heard.\n\nExamples include:\n*   「謎めく」 \"to appear to be a riddle\"\n*   「皮肉めく」 \"to appear to be sarcastic\"\n*   「言い訳めく」 \"to appear to be an excuse\"\n*   「作り物めく」 \"to appear to be fictitious\"\n*   Seasons of the year (ex: 「春めく」 to show signs of spring)",
