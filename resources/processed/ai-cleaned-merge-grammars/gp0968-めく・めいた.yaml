    "details": {
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "general"
    },
    "etymology": "「めく」 is derived from the verb 「兆す(きざす)」, meaning \"to show signs of\" or \"to indicate\". Over time, 「めく」 evolved to express a sense of resemblance or approximation, often used to describe something that has the *feeling* or *appearance* of something else, without actually being it. It's a classical Japanese verb stem that has largely fossilized into a suffix-like function in modern Japanese.",
    "writeup": "「めく」 is a unique Godan verb in Japanese that primarily functions as a suffix. It signifies \"to show signs of (A)\" or \"to have the appearance of (A).\" It attaches to nouns, reflecting the speaker's perception or experience. As 「めく」 itself is a verb, it can conjugate into various forms depending on how it describes the rest of the sentence. When directly modifying a second noun, the past-tense form 「めいた」 is commonly used.\n\nIt's **important** to note that 「めく」 often highlights the speaker's personal feelings about (A) and their subjective perception. The described thing is not necessarily (A) in reality, and the speaker is usually aware of this distinction. This subjective nature is why many of its conjugations, such as imperative or causative forms, are pragmatically very rare or even unnatural, as 'showing signs of' something is generally not an action one can intentionally command or cause another to do.\n\n「めく」 is often used with established expressions, so it's best to use it with combinations you've encountered before. Some common examples include:\n*   「春めく」 (haru meku): to show signs of spring\n*   「秋めく」 (aki meku): to show signs of autumn\n*   「謎めく」 (nazo meku): to appear mysterious\n*   「皮肉めく」 (hiniku meku): to appear sarcastic\n*   「冗談めく」 (jōdan meku): to appear like a joke\n*   「作り物めく」 (tsukurimono meku): to appear artificial",
