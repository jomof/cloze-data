    "etymology": "「めく」is derived from the verb 「兆す(きざす)」, meaning \"to show signs of\" or \"to indicate\". Over time, 「めく」evolved to express a sense of resemblance or approximation, often used to describe something that has the *feeling* or *appearance* of something else, without actually being it.",
    "writeup": "「めく」 is a somewhat unique verb that functions primarily as a suffix. It signifies \"to show signs of (A)\" or \"to have the appearance of (A).\" It attaches to nouns, reflecting the speaker's perception or experience. 「めく」 itself can conjugate into various forms, depending on the sentence's structure. When directly modifying a noun, the past-tense form 「めいた」 is common.\n\nIt's **important** to note that 「めく」 often highlights the speaker's personal feelings about (A) and their subjective perception. The described thing isn't necessarily (A) in reality, and the speaker is often aware of this.\n\n「めく」 is often used with established expressions, so it's best to use it with combinations you've encountered before. Examples include:\n*   「謎めく」: to appear to be a riddle\n*   「皮肉めく」: to appear sarcastic\n*   「言い訳めく」: to appear to be an excuse\n*   「作り物めく」: to appear fictitious\n*   Seasons of the year (春めく, 夏めく, 秋めく, 冬めく)",
