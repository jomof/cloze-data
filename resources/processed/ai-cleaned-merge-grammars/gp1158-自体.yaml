    },
    "etymology": "「自体」 (jitai) is composed of two kanji: 「自」 (ji), meaning \"self\" or \"oneself,\" and 「体」 (tai), meaning \"body,\" \"substance,\" or \"form.\" When combined, they literally translate to \"self-body\" or \"self-substance,\" thereby conveying the meaning of \"the thing itself\" or \"in and of itself.\" This etymology directly reflects its function in emphasizing the intrinsic nature or essence of a noun, setting it apart from external attributes or influences.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「自体」(jitai) functions as a dependent noun used to place emphasis on the inherent qualities, nature, or essence of the preceding noun or noun phrase. It highlights the noun itself, distinct from any external factors, circumstances, or effects. It can be translated as \"itself,\" \"in and of itself,\" or \"the very thing.\"\n\nThis expression is typically used in formal or semi-formal contexts, including academic writing, business discussions, or formal speeches. While it is grammatically versatile, its primary role is to sharpen the focus on the subject at hand, often to draw a contrast or to isolate an inherent truth.\n\n### Usage Notes:\n*   **Emphasis on Nouns**: 「自体」 directly follows a noun to emphasize that specific noun. For example, 「問題自体」(mondai jitai) means \"the problem itself.\"\n*   **Emphasis on Noun Phrases (Actions/Concepts)**: It can also follow noun phrases, especially those ending in 「こと」 or 「の」, to emphasize the action or concept. For instance, 「参加すること自体」(sanka suru koto jitai) means \"the act of participating itself.\"\n*   **「それ自体」 for Stronger Emphasis**: Adding 「それ」 (sore, meaning \"that\") before 「自体」 creates a more emphatic expression: 「〜それ自体」(sore jitai). This construction further isolates the noun, often implying that its intrinsic nature is being considered apart from all other aspects. For example, 「技術それ自体」(gijutsu sore jitai) would strongly emphasize \"the technology itself,\" perhaps in contrast to its applications or implications.\n\n「自体」 is crucial for conveying precision and nuanced emphasis in Japanese, allowing speakers to direct attention to the core identity or inherent characteristics of a subject.",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「自体」, 「自身」 often refers to a person's own self or being, or emphasizes that the person themselves is doing something. For example, 「彼自身が言った」 (kare jishin ga itta) means 'he himself said it.' While 「自体」 can refer to the essence of something abstract, 「自身」 is more commonly used for sentient beings or their direct involvement. It can also be used reflexively, e.g., 「自分自身」 (jibun jishin) meaning 'myself.'"

            "nuance": "「そのもの」 (sono mono) is used to emphasize that something is exactly what it seems or is claimed to be, often confirming its authenticity or definitive nature. It focuses on identity. For example, 「この絵は本物そのものだ」 (kono e wa honmono sono mono da) means 'This painting is the very real thing.'

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「自体」, 「自身」, and 「そのもの」 all serve to emphasize a noun or concept, their specific nuances differ. 「自体」 focuses on the intrinsic nature or core essence of something, separating it from external factors. 「自身」 is typically used when referring to a person or their direct involvement, emphasizing the individual themselves. 「そのもの」, on the other hand, highlights the authenticity or perfect embodiment of something, confirming it is precisely what it purports to be.
