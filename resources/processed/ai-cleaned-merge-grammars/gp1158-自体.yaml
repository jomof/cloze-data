        "[Noun] + それ + 自体": "Provides stronger emphasis on the noun itself, often used when distinguishing it from other aspects or elements related to it, with 「それ」 acting as a demonstrative pronoun for the preceding noun.

        "nuance": "Implies that the focus is on the thing itself, rather than external factors or related elements. It highlights the noun's core identity or intrinsic nature.

    },
    "etymology": "「自体」 (jitai) is composed of two kanji: 「自」 (ji), meaning \"self\" or \"oneself,\" and 「体」 (tai), meaning \"body,\" \"substance,\" or \"form.\" When combined, they literally translate to \"self-body\" or \"self-substance,\" thereby conveying the meaning of \"the thing itself\" or \"in and of itself.\" This etymology directly reflects its function in emphasizing the intrinsic nature or essence of a noun, setting it apart from external attributes or influences.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「自体」(jitai) functions as a dependent noun used to place emphasis on the inherent qualities, nature, or essence of the preceding noun or noun phrase. It highlights the noun itself, distinct from any external factors, circumstances, or effects. It can be translated as \"itself,\" \"in and of itself,\" or \"the very thing.\"\n\nThis expression is typically used in formal or semi-formal contexts, including academic writing, business discussions, or formal speeches. While it is grammatically versatile, its primary role is to sharpen the focus on the subject at hand, often to draw a contrast or to isolate an inherent truth.\n\n### Usage Notes:\n*   **Emphasis on Nouns**: 「自体」 directly follows a noun to emphasize that specific noun. For example, 「問題自体」(mondai jitai) means \"the problem itself.\"\n*   **Emphasis on Noun Phrases (Actions/Concepts)**: It can also follow noun phrases, especially those ending in 「こと」 or 「の」, to emphasize the action or concept. For instance, 「参加すること自体」(sanka suru koto jitai) means \"the act of participating itself.\"\n*   **「それ自体」 for Stronger Emphasis**: Adding 「それ」 (sore, meaning \"that\") before 「自体」 creates a more emphatic expression: 「〜それ自体」(sore jitai). This construction further isolates the noun, often implying that its intrinsic nature is being considered apart from all other aspects. For example, 「技術それ自体」(gijutsu sore jitai) would strongly emphasize \"the technology itself,\" perhaps in contrast to its applications or implications.\n\n「自体」 is crucial for conveying precision and nuanced emphasis in Japanese, allowing speakers to direct attention to the core identity or inherent characteristics of a subject.",
