    "etymology": "The word 「ため」 originally meant \"for the sake of\" or \"for the purpose of.\" Over time, it evolved to also express the meaning of \"due to\" or \"because of,\" highlighting the connection between a cause and its resulting effect. Adding 「に」 to 「ため」 creates an adverbial phrase that modifies the verb or adjective that follows.",
    "writeup": "The grammatical construct 「ために」 connects a cause or reason (A) to a resulting effect or consequence (B). While 「ため」 on its own can mean \"sake\" or \"purpose,\" when combined with 「に」 in this structure, it functions primarily to express \"due to,\" \"because of,\" or \"as a result of.\" It often highlights an objective or factual reason for something, making it suitable for a range of situations from formal announcements to casual explanations. This grammar point typically describes situations where A is the primary event or characteristic that directly led to B. It can be used for both positive and negative outcomes.\n\nTo form sentences using 「ために」:\n*   For **verbs**, use the **past tense (た-form)**: Verbた + ために\n*   For **nouns**, add **の**: Noun + の + ために\n*   For **い-adjectives**, attach directly: い-Adjective + ために\n*   For **な-adjectives**, add **な**: な-Adjective + な + ために\n\nAlthough 「ために」 can also express purpose (e.g., \"in order to\"), this specific grammar point focuses on its use in indicating a cause-and-effect relationship, often in reference to events that have already occurred or existing conditions.",
