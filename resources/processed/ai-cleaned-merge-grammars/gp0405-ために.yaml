    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ために」 expresses cause and effect. It indicates that something happened as a result of a particular reason or situation. 「ため」 itself is a noun meaning \"sake\" or \"purpose,\" but in this grammatical structure, it functions to show a cause-and-effect relationship. It is similar to saying \"in light of\" something. To use 「ために」 to mean \"in light of\", \"as a result of\", or \"because of\", attach it to the end of a verb in its past form, or a noun followed by 「の」. It may also be used after い-adjectives or な-adjectives. 「ために」 is neutral and can be used in most situations.",
    "etymology": "The word 「ため」 originally meant \"for the sake of\" or \"for the purpose of.\" Over time, it evolved to also express the meaning of \"due to\" or \"because of,\" highlighting the connection between a cause and its resulting effect. Adding 「に」 to 「ため」 creates an adverbial phrase that modifies the verb or adjective that follows.",
