details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  register: formal
  function: A transitive verb that expresses a strong feeling of dislike, hatred, or aversion towards
    someone or something. It implies a desire to avoid or shun the object.
  nuance: While 嫌い (kirai) describes a state of disliking, 嫌う (kirau) denotes the action of disliking
    or shunning. It carries a more active nuance, indicating that one avoids or rejects something due
    to strong negative feelings. It can also be used in a broader sense to mean 'to avoid' or 'to keep
    away from' certain situations or actions, beyond just emotional dislike. It can feel slightly formal
    or direct.
  grammatical-role: Transitive verb, requiring a direct object marked by を.
etymology: The verb 「嫌う」 (kirau) derives from the root of the adjective 「嫌い」 (kirai, 'disliked' or 'hated').
  The character 嫌 (iya) fundamentally conveys unpleasantness or disagreeableness. While 「嫌い」 describes
  a state or a feeling of aversion, the verb 「嫌う」 evolved to express the active process of feeling that
  aversion and, consequently, shunning or avoiding something. It captures the transition from a passive
  state of dislike to an active behavioral response, reinforcing the idea of pushing away or rejecting
  that which is unpleasant.
writeup: |-
  「嫌う」 is a transitive verb in Japanese meaning 'to dislike,' 'to hate,' 'to detest,' or 'to shun.' It expresses a strong, active feeling of aversion towards someone or something, often implying a desire to avoid or keep away from it. Unlike the adjective 「嫌い」, which simply describes a state of disliking, 「嫌う」 emphasizes the action or active feeling of holding something in aversion.

  This verb can be used in a wide range of contexts, from disliking certain foods to hating particular behaviors or concepts. It is commonly used with the particle 「を」 to mark the direct object of one's dislike. For example, 「私は寒い場所を嫌います」 (I dislike cold places) or 「彼は嘘を嫌う」 (He hates lies).

  When the object of dislike is an action or a full clause, the verb or clause is nominalized using 「の」 before 「を嫌う」. For instance, 「私は早起きするのが嫌いです」 (I dislike getting up early) would become 「私は早起きするのを嫌う」 (I shun getting up early), emphasizing the act of shunning.

  While it can convey strong negative emotions similar to 'hate' in English, its intensity can vary with context. It is generally a direct and unambiguous way to express aversion.

    meaning: to hate, to detest, to loathe (stronger emotion)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「憎む」 implies a deeper, often more personal and intense hatred, usually towards people, actions,
      or injustices. It suggests a more profound emotional wound. 「嫌う」 can apply more broadly to things

  - term: 毛嫌いする
    meaning: to instinctively dislike, to have a strong aversion to (often without reason)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「毛嫌いする」 suggests an aversion that might be irrational, unfounded, or based on prejudice, often
      without having properly experienced or understood the object. It implies a 'gut reaction' of dislike.
      「嫌う」 is a more general term for disliking based on experience or reason.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:毛嫌いする (to instinctively dislike)
post_false_friends_writeup: Distinguishing between 「嫌う」, 「嫌いだ」, 「憎む」, and 「毛嫌いする」 is crucial for expressing
  nuance in Japanese. 「嫌いだ」 describes a static state of disliking (e.g., 「納豆が嫌いだ」 - I dislike natto).
  「嫌う」, as a verb, describes the action of disliking or actively shunning (e.g., 「彼は嘘を嫌う」 - He shuns lies).
  「憎む」 conveys a much stronger, often deeply emotional hatred, typically reserved for people or severe
  actions (e.g., 「裏切り者を憎む」 - To hate traitors). Finally, 「毛嫌いする」 implies an unfounded or instinctive aversion,
  often without a rational basis (e.g., 「彼は野菜を毛嫌いする」 - He instinctively dislikes vegetables). Choose the
  term that best fits the intensity and nature of the aversion you wish to express.

post_example_writeup: As demonstrated in the examples, 「嫌う」 can be used across various situations and
  registers. Pay attention to the particle 「を」 when directly disliking a noun or nominalized phrase. The
  use of different conjugations, such as the passive 「嫌われる」 or the negative imperative 「嫌わないで」, allows
  for expressing a range of meanings from being disliked to advising against disliking something.
