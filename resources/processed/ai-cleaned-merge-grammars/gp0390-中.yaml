    "etymology": "The kanji 「中」 literally means \"middle\" or \"inside.\" When used as a suffix, it indicates a period of time or space within which something occurs or exists.",
    "writeup": "「中」 as a suffix is frequently used to highlight a period of time (or space).  It is attached to a noun with the particle 「に」 to show that something is happening or existing throughout that timeframe or space. This is often translated as \"throughout (A), (B)\" or \"during (A), (B).\" \n\nThere are two common readings of 「中」 in this construction, 「ちゅう」 and 「じゅう」. The basic rule for which to use is as follows:\n*   「ちゅう」 expresses a very specific (usually small) amount of time or space, or something that is not always the same (an amount of time/space that can change, depending on the person/situation). 「ちゅう」 highlights a 'process,' and means that (A) is \"in the process\" of happening. (e.g., meeting, class, visit to somewhere).\n*   「じゅう」 expresses a predetermined amount of time or space that will always remain the same, regardless of the person/situation. 「じゅう」 does not highlight a 'process,' but focuses on the 'length' or 'space' itself. This tends to mean \"all throughout,\" as it focuses on the full amount of time or space (e.g., a day, year, house, town, or country).\n\nThere is also a difference between 「音読み」 (Chinese readings of words) and 「訓読み」 (Japanese readings of words). 「じゅう」 is used more frequently with 「訓読み」 (e.g., 今年中, 夏休み中, 今晩中), while 「ちゅう」 is used more frequently with 「音読み」 (e.g., 水中, 会議中, 試合中).",
