    "etymology": "「中」 (chū/jū) literally means \"middle\" or \"inside.\" When used as a suffix in grammar, it denotes being in the midst of an action, event, or timeframe. The nuance varies slightly depending on whether it's read as 「ちゅう」 (chū) or 「じゅう」 (jū).",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「中」 is used to indicate a period of time or space. It often highlights that something (B) is happening or existing within the timeframe or space of something else (A). This can be translated as \"throughout (A), (B)\" or \"during (A), (B).\"\n\nTo show that event (B) happens within (A), add the particle 「に」 to the end of the noun indicating the space. 「中に」 can be read as either 「ちゅうに」 or 「じゅうに」. \n\n*   「ちゅう」 expresses a specific, often smaller amount of time/space, or something that is not fixed. It emphasizes that (A) is in the process of happening, like 「会議中」 (in the middle of a meeting). \n*   「じゅう」 expresses a predetermined, fixed amount of time/space. It focuses on the length or space itself, meaning \"all throughout,\" as it highlights the full amount of time/space, such as 「今年中」 (throughout this year).\n\n「じゅう」 is more frequently used with 訓読み (Japanese readings), while 「ちゅう」 is more frequently used with 音読み (Chinese readings). Examples of 訓読み include 「今年中」, 「夏休み中」, and 「今晩中」. Examples of 音読み include 「水中」, 「会議中」, and 「試合中」.",
