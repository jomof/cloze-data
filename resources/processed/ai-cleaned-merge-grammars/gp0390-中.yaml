    "etymology": "The kanji 「中」 literally means \"middle\" or \"inside.\" When used as a suffix, it indicates a period of time or space within which something occurs or exists.",
    "writeup": "「中」 as a suffix is frequently used to highlight a period of time (or space). It is attached to a noun with or without the particle 「に」 to show that something is happening or existing throughout that timeframe or space. This is often translated as \"throughout (A), (B)\" or \"during (A), (B).\"\n\nThere are two common readings of 「中」 in this construction, 「ちゅう」 and 「じゅう」. The basic rule for which to use is as follows:\n*   **ちゅう** (ちゅう) expresses a very specific (usually small) amount of time or space, or something that is not always the same (an amount of time/space that can change, depending on the person/situation). 「ちゅう」 highlights a 'process,' and means that (A) is \"in the process\" of happening. For example: meeting, class, or a visit to somewhere.\n*   **じゅう** (じゅう) expresses a predetermined amount of time or space that will always remain the same, regardless of the person/situation. 「じゅう」 does not highlight a 'process,' but focuses on the 'length' or 'space' itself. This tends to mean \"all throughout,\" as it focuses on the full amount of time or space. For example: a day, year, house, town, or country.\n\nThere is also a difference between 音読み (Chinese readings of words) and 訓読み (Japanese readings of words). 「じゅう」 is used more frequently with 訓読み (e.g., 今年中 (ことしじゅう), 夏休み中 (なつやすみじゅう), 今晩中 (こんばんじゅう)), while 「ちゅう」 is used more frequently with 音読み (e.g., 水中 (すいちゅう), 会議中 (かいぎちゅう), 試合中 (しあいちゅう)). This grammar point is widely applicable across various registers, from casual to formal, depending on the preceding noun and context.",
