    "etymology": "The prefix 「真(ま)」 comes from the kanji 真 (shin), meaning \"true\" or \"genuine.\" When used as a prefix, it intensifies the meaning of the following word, indicating a complete or exact state.",
    "writeup": "The prefix 「真(ま)」, derived from the kanji for \"true,\" is added to words to express that something is \"completely,\" \"exactly,\" or \"genuinely.\" The form of 真 changes depending on the first kana of the following word.  There are three main patterns:\n\n*   **真ん(まん):** Used before words starting with 「ま」 or 「な」 column kana (e.g., 真ん丸, 真ん中).\n*   **真っ(まっ):** Used before words starting with 「か」, 「さ」, or 「しゃ」 column kana (e.g., 真っ赤, 真っ白).\n*   **真っ(まっ) + P sound:** Used before words starting with 「は」 column kana. The first kana of the following word changes to a 「ぱ, ぴ, ぷ, ぺ, ぽ」 sound (e.g., 真っ昼間).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   There are exceptions. When used with 「青い」, 真 becomes 真っ, and 青い becomes 青 (真っ青). The same happens with 「赤い」, which becomes 真っ赤.\n*   Pay attention to the pronunciation changes, especially when the following word starts with an 「は」 column kana.",
