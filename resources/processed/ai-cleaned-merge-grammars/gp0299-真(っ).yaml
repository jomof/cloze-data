    "etymology": "The prefix 真 (ma), originating from the kanji 真 (shin) meaning \"true\" or \"genuine,\" is used to emphasize the degree or trueness of a following word. It adds a sense of \"completely,\" \"exactly,\" or \"genuinely\" to the meaning.",
    "writeup": "The prefix 真 (ma), coming from the kanji 真 (true), is attached to words in Japanese to express that something is **completely**, **exactly**, or **genuinely**. Depending on the word that follows 真, different euphonic changes will occur to 真.\n\nWhen linked with a ま column, or な column word, 真 will become 真ん (man). For instance, 丸 (maru) becomes 真ん丸 (manmaru).\n\nWhen linked with a か column, さ column, or しゃ sound word, 真 will become 真っ (mat). Examples include 真っ直ぐ (massugu) and 真っ逆さま (massakasama).\n\nWhen linked with a は column, 真 will become 真っ, and the first kana of the following word will change to a 'P' sound. For example, 裸 (hadaka) becomes 真っ裸 (mappadaka), and 昼間 (hiruma) becomes 真っ昼間 (mappiruma).\n\nThere are several exceptions to the standard changes that happen when using 真 as a prefix. For example, when linked with 青い (aoi), 真 will become 真っ, and 青い will become 真っ青 (massao). Similarly, when linked with 赤い (akai), 真 will become 真っ, and 赤い will become 真っ赤 (makka).",
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "This grammar point is a prefix and does not typically have false friends in the sense of easily confused expressions. However, it is crucial to understand that it serves to emphasize the following word, often a color or a state, conveying a sense of completeness or exactness. Distinguishing it from simple adjectives or adverbs relies on recognizing this intensification of meaning.",
