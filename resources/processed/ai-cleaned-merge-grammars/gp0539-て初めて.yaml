    "etymology": "The grammar point 「て初めて」 is composed of 「て」, which connects actions in sequence, and 「初めて」 (hajimete), meaning \"for the first time.\" Thus, it literally means \"after doing something, for the first time [something else happens].\"",
    "writeup": "「て初めて」 is used to express that something happens or becomes apparent **only after** a certain action or event has taken place. It emphasizes the idea that the first action is a necessary condition for the subsequent event to occur or be understood. It often carries a sense of discovery or realization that comes as a result of the first action. This is often translated as \"not until\", \"only after\", or \"for the first time [doing something].\"",
