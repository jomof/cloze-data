    "etymology": "The grammar point 「て初めて」 is composed of 「て」, which connects actions in sequence, and 「初めて」 (hajimete), meaning \"for the first time.\" Thus, it literally means \"after doing something, for the first time [something else happens].\"",
    "writeup": "「て初めて」 is used to express that something happens or becomes apparent **only after** a certain action or event has taken place. It emphasizes the idea that the first action is a necessary condition for the subsequent event to occur or be understood. It often carries a sense of discovery or realization that comes as a result of the first action. This is often translated as \"not until\", \"only after\", or \"for the first time [doing something].\"\n\nOriginally, 「始めて」 ('commencing with') and 「初めて」 ('starting with') were both used with this expression. However, using 「始めて」 is considered incorrect in modern Japanese, as only 「初めて」 strictly carries the meaning of 'for the first time' and implies a new, unique experience.",
