    "etymology": "The expression 「に照らして」 is derived from the verb 「照らす」 (terasu), which means \"to illuminate\" or \"to compare.\" The 「に」 indicates the basis or standard against which something is being compared or evaluated.",
    "writeup": "「に照らして」 and 「に照らすと」 are expressions built upon the verb 「照らす」, meaning \"to illuminate\" or \"to shine a light on.\" They are used to indicate that something is being evaluated, judged, or considered **in light of**, **based on**, or **in accordance with** a particular standard, fact, or perspective.\n\nThe noun preceding 「に」 serves as the **standard** or **point of reference**. It is what provides the \"illumination\" or clarity for the subsequent statement or judgment. Think of it as using that noun as a lens through which to view or understand something else. The phrase effectively means \"using [Noun] as an illumination,\" or \"seeing something as illuminated by [Noun].\" The statement that follows is almost always a logical conclusion or judgment derived from this standard.\n\nTo use this structure, you attach the particle 「に」 to a noun, followed by either 「照らして」 or 「照らすと」. If the phrase is used to directly modify a subsequent noun, the past/attributive form 「に照らした」 is employed.",
