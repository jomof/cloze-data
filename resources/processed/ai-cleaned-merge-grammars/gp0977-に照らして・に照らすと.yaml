    },
    "etymology": "The expression 「に照らして」 is derived from the verb 「照らす」 (terasu), which means 'to illuminate' or 'to compare/contrast'. The particle 「に」 indicates the basis or standard against which something is being compared or evaluated. This creates a metaphorical sense of 'shining a light on' or 'viewing through the lens of' the preceding noun, thereby clarifying the subsequent judgment or statement.",
    "writeup": "「に照らして」 and 「に照らすと」 are expressions built upon the verb 「照らす」, meaning 'to illuminate' or 'to shine a light on'. They are used to indicate that something is being evaluated, judged, or considered **in light of**, **based on**, or **in accordance with** a particular standard, fact, or perspective.The noun preceding 「に」 serves as the **standard** or **point of reference**. It is what provides the 'illumination' or clarity for the subsequent statement or judgment. Think of it as using that noun as a lens through which to view or understand something else. The phrase effectively means 'using [Noun] as an illumination,' or 'seeing something as illuminated by [Noun].' The statement that follows is almost always a logical conclusion or judgment derived from this standard.To use this structure, you attach the particle 「に」 to a noun, followed by either 「照らして」 (the te-form) or 「照らすと」 (the plain form plus the conditional particle と). If the phrase is used to directly modify a subsequent noun, the past/attributive form 「に照らした」 is employed. The nuance conveyed by `に照らして・に照らすと` is stronger than simply stating 'based on' or 'according to', emphasizing that the standard provides critical insight or clarity for the judgment being made.",
