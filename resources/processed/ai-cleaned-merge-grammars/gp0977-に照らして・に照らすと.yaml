    "etymology": "The expression 「に照らして」 is derived from the verb 「照らす」 (terasu), which means \"to illuminate\" or \"to compare.\" The 「に」 indicates the basis or standard against which something is being compared or evaluated.",
    "writeup": "「に照らして」 is an expression based on the verb 「照らす」 (to illuminate) and is primarily used for comparisons, similar to \"in light of\" in English. This comparative meaning aims to illustrate (B) from the perspective of (A), usually referring to situations, experience, or something similar.\n\nTo use this structure, attach the particle 「に」 to the end of a noun, followed by 「照らして」. If a second noun will be modified directly, then 「照らした」 is used instead.\n\nKeep in mind that the 「に」 in this structure marks (A) as the \"doer\" of 「照らす」. This means the structure has a more literal translation of \"(B) as reflected by (A),\" or \"as made clear/evident by (A), (B).\" (B) will almost always be a judgment logically based on (A).",
