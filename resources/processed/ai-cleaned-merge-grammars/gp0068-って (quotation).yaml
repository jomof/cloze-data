jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: casual
  particle-syntactic-function: quotative
  particle-pragmatic-function: discourse marker
  usage-context: casual language
  function: To convey reported speech or thought informally
  nuance: Emphasizes a casual, direct, or informal relay of information.
  colocation: Often used with verbs like 言う (to say), 思う (to think), 聞く (to hear), 書く (to write).
etymology: The particle 「って」 is a colloquial contraction of 「と」, the standard quotation particle. This
  type of abbreviation is common in casual speech to simplify and speed up communication. Its evolution
  reflects a natural tendency in language to shorten frequently used constructions for efficiency, particularly
  in informal settings.
writeup: "「って」 is a versatile particle primarily used as a casual alternative to the more formal quotation\
  \ particle 「と」. It acts like a casual marker for reported speech or thought, often conveying a sense\
  \ of \"they said...\" or \"I heard that...\" without needing to explicitly state the verb of communication.\
  \ This makes conversation flow more naturally and quickly among friends and family.\n\nWhile its primary\
  \ function is to mark direct or indirect quotations, 「って」 can also be used to: \n*   **Express what\
  \ one heard or gathered**: Similar to \"I heard that...\" or \"apparently...\".\n*   **Report one's\
  \ own thoughts or decisions**: Especially when these thoughts are presented as if being 'quoted' from\
  \ oneself.\n*   **Convey information from inanimate sources**: Like a sign or a book \"saying\" something.\n\
  *   **Emphasize a point or question**: Adding a nuance of \"what do you mean by...?\" or \"you mean\
  \ to say...?\"\n\nIt's important to remember that because 「って」 is very casual, it might sound out of\
  \ place in highly formal or polite conversations, particularly when followed by highly polite forms\
  \ like 「です」 or 「ます」 directly. However, in friendly, but still polite, situations, such as between a\
  \ senpai and kouhai, this usage is perfectly normal and common. In extremely casual settings, the verb\
  \ following 「って」 can even be entirely omitted, relying on context for understanding."

  - term: と (quotation)
    meaning: Quotation
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「って」, 「と」 is the standard quotation particle, more formal and suitable for written
      language and formal speech. It does not carry the same casual, immediate feel as 「って」.
    grammar_point: と (quotation)
  - term: といってもいい (you could say)
    meaning: You could say, You might say
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「って」, which is used to quote direct statements or thoughts, 「といってもいい」 is used to provide
      an alternative way of describing something, offering a possible interpretation, or making a concession.
    grammar_point: といってもいい (you could say)
  - term: んだって (I heard that)
    meaning: I heard that, He or She said that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both convey information heard from someone else, 「んだって」 often implies the information
      is new, surprising, or being relayed as hearsay. 「って」, on the other hand, can be a more direct and
      casual report of what was said, without necessarily implying surprise or novelty.
    grammar_point: んだって (I heard that)
  - term: とのこと
    meaning: It is said that, I am told that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とのこと」 is a more formal and indirect way of reporting information, often used in professional
      or public announcements. It implies the information was officially conveyed or heard from a reliable
      source. 「って」 is for personal, informal reports.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:とのこと (it is said that)
  - term: らしい (appears to be)
    meaning: It seems, apparently
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「らしい」 indicates that something is apparently true based on what one has heard or observed,
      but it carries a nuance of inference or conjecture. 「って」 is used for directly quoting or casually
      reporting something that was actually said or thought.
    grammar_point: らしい (appears to be)
post_false_friends_writeup: When using 「って」, remember it's a shortened, casual form of 「と」. When deciding
  which to use, consider the formality of the situation. If you're writing an essay or speaking to your
  boss, stick with 「と」. Use 「って」 with friends and family. As for 「といってもいい」 and 「んだって」, make sure you are
  using them in the correct context; the former suggests an alternative description or a concession, whereas
  the latter means 'I heard that...' often with a nuance of new information. 「とのこと」 is more formal and
  used for official reports, while 「らしい」 implies inference rather than direct quotation.

      (e.g., 「聞いた」), making it sound natural for a quick, informal exchange.

      - competing_japanese:
          - ここ は 駐車 禁止 だ よ。
        english: This place is no parking.

    register: casual

      to confirm information that one has heard or to express surprise. It acts as a shortcut for "Did
      you hear that...?" or "Is it true that...?".
