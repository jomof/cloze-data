    "etymology": "The particle 「って」 is a colloquial contraction of 「と」, the standard quotation particle. This type of abbreviation is common in casual speech to simplify and speed up communication.",
    "writeup": "「って」 is a casual alternative to the 「と」 particle when quoting someone or something. Think of it as a shorthand way of saying \"and then they said...\" or \"I heard that...\" in casual conversation. It is almost always used after direct quotations and followed by a verb indicating what kind of communication was used such as 「言った」 (itta - said), 「思った」 (omotta - thought), or 「聞いた」 (kiita - heard). Just like with 「と」, the verb that comes after 「って」 is frequently omitted, especially in casual conversation. However, it's important to remember that because 「って」 is very casual, it might sound unnatural in sentences that use polite structures like 「です」 or 「ます」. However, in friendly, but still polite, situations, such as between a senpai and kouhai, this usage is normal.",
