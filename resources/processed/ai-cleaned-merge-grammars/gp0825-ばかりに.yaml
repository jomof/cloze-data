    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ばかりに」 is derived from 「ばかり」, which means \"just\" or \"only,\" combined with the particle 「に」. The 「ばかり」 can be traced back to the verb 「測る (はかる)」 (hakaru) meaning 'to measure,' implying a limited extent or degree. 「に」 indicates the reason or cause. Historically, ばかり shares etymological roots with 許す (yurusu) meaning 'to allow' or 'to forgive,' which has a nuance of 'letting through' or 'permitting a minimum amount.' This sense of 'just this much' or 'only this' leading to a consequence is retained in ばかりに, often highlighting a surprisingly significant result from a minimal cause.",
    "writeup": "「ばかりに」 is a grammatical construction used to convey that something occurred **simply because** of a specific reason or situation. It frequently carries a nuance of regret or highlights an unexpected negative outcome resulting from a particular cause. The structure is attached to the plain past form of verbs, the plain form of い-adjectives, the stem of な-adjectives (followed by な, である, だった, or であった), or nouns (followed by である, だった, or であった). While it is most commonly associated with negative consequences, it can occasionally express a strong desire or enthusiasm when paired with expressions like 「たい」 (want to) or 「ほしい」 (want). This pattern emphasizes a single factor as the direct and often decisive cause of a particular outcome. The underlying nuance of 「ばかりに」 stems from the idea of 'just this much' or 'only this' being enough to lead to a significant, often surprising, result. This concept is connected to words like 「許す」 (yurusu), which implies 'allowing' or 'letting through' a minimum amount, leading to a consequence. This makes 「ばかりに」 suitable for situations where a small cause yields a disproportionate effect.",
