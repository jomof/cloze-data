    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ばかりに」 is derived from 「ばかり」, which means \"just\" or \"only,\" combined with the particle 「に」. The 「ばかり」 can be traced back to the verb 「測る(はかる)」 (hakaru) meaning 'to measure,' implying a limited extent or degree. 「に」 indicates the reason or cause.",
    "writeup": "「ばかりに」 is used to express that something occurred **simply because** of a specific reason or situation. It often carries a nuance of regret or an unexpected negative outcome resulting from a particular cause. The structure is usually attached to the past form of verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives (followed by な/である/だった/であった), or nouns (followed by である/だった/であった). While it's often associated with negative consequences, it can sometimes express strong desire or enthusiasm when paired with expressions like 「たい」 or 「ほしい」. It's good to remember that 「ばかりに」 highlights a single factor as the direct cause of a particular outcome.",
