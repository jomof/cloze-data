    "writeup": "**ばかりに** expresses that something occurred simply because of the preceding reason. It often carries a nuance of regret or an unexpected consequence. The grammar point emphasizes the surprising result that stems from a seemingly minor cause. It's frequently used with the past form of verbs. While often associated with negative outcomes, it can also express eagerness or enthusiasm when paired with expressions like **たい** or **ほしい**. Etymologically, **ばかり** is related to the kanji 許 (to forgive, to permit), suggesting the idea of \"just\" meeting a minimum condition. Therefore, it can be thought of as 'even with only/just (A), (B)'.",
    "etymology": "The term ばかり stems from the kanji 「許」, meaning \"to permit\" or \"to allow.\" In this context, it implies that the condition is barely met, yet it still leads to a particular result. This origin lends itself to the nuance of something surprising or unexpected happening.",
