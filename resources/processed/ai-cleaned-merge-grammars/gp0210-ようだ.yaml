        "nuance": "Implies the speaker's statement is based on firsthand, reliable information, often visual, leading to a high degree of confidence in the observation."
    },
    "etymology": "「よう」 comes from the verb 「言う」 (iu, to say), evolving over time to indicate a state or condition that resembles what is being described. 「だ」 is the plain form of the copula 「です」, indicating affirmation or declaration. This usage highlights how observation leads to a 'declaration' of appearance or likelihood.",
    "writeup": "「ようだ」 is an auxiliary adjective used to express observations about something, indicating **likelihood or resemblance** based on direct information or personal experience. Unlike 「みたい」, which is more colloquial and subjective, 「ようだ」 carries a higher degree of certainty and is typically used in more standard or formal contexts. It reflects the speaker's confidence in their statement, often stemming from firsthand, reliable evidence, such as visual information.\n\nThis grammar point can be used with various parts of speech:\n*   **Verbs**: Attach directly to the plain form (e.g., 行くようだ - *It seems he's going*).\n*   **い-adjectives**: Attach directly to the plain form (e.g., 寒いようだ - *It seems cold*).\n*   **な-adjectives**: Attach 'な' after the stem (e.g., 静かなようだ - *It seems quiet*).\n*   **Nouns**: Attach 'の' after the noun (e.g., 医者のようだ - *He seems to be a doctor*).\n*   **Demonstratives**: Such as 「その」 to express 'it seems so' (e.g., そのようだ - *It seems so*).\n\nWhile 「ようだ」 and 「そうだ」 both express conjecture, 「そうだ」 (when indicating appearance or hearsay) generally implies less confidence. For instance, 「雨が降りそうだ」 (It looks like it's going to rain, based on visual cues like dark clouds) might be used when the speaker is less certain, whereas 「雨が降るようだ」 (It seems it will rain, based on a weather forecast or strong evidence) suggests higher confidence in the observation. Therefore, 「ようだ」 is often a better choice when stating things that are obvious or clearly observable to anyone. It is also common to see 「ようだ」 written with the kanji 「様だ」, particularly in written Japanese or more formal contexts.",
