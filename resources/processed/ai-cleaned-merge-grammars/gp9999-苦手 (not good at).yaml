etymology: The word 苦手 (nigate) is formed from 苦 (niga), meaning 'bitter' or 'painful,' and 手 (te), meaning
  'hand' or 'skill.' Historically, it literally conveyed the idea of a 'painful hand' or 'difficult skill,'
  referring to something one struggles with or finds unpleasant to engage with. This etymology highlights
  the inherent nuance of aversion and discomfort, not just a mere lack of proficiency.
writeup: |-
  苦手 (nigate) is a versatile word used to express that one is not good at something, or has a strong aversion or discomfort towards it. While often translated simply as 'not good at,' it encompasses a broader range of feelings than just a lack of skill. It frequently implies a subjective sense of discomfort, awkwardness, or even dislike associated with a particular task, subject, person, or situation. It's often used when you feel you *should* be able to do something but genuinely struggle with it or find it unpleasant. For instance, you might say you are 苦手 at math, meaning you find it difficult and unpleasant, not just that you get bad grades. Or, you might be 苦手 with certain types of people, implying you feel uncomfortable interacting with them.

  When using 苦手, the thing you are bad at or have an aversion to is typically marked with the particle が. For actions, you would use the nominalized verb form (dictionary form + の) followed by が. For people or things you have an aversion to, you can sometimes use は to mark the topic, or に to indicate the target of your aversion. The nuance of 苦手 leans towards a personal, internal feeling of difficulty or discomfort, making it distinct from purely objective evaluations of skill.

  - term: 下手 (へた)
    meaning: unskillful, bad at
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 下手 purely describes a lack of skill or ability, an objective assessment. It does not carry
      the connotation of aversion or discomfort that 苦手 does. You can be 下手 at something you enjoy doing.
      For example, someone might say they are 下手 at drawing but still love to draw. 苦手, on the other hand,
      implies a personal struggle or dislike.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:下手 (unskillful)
  - term: 嫌い (きらい)
    meaning: dislike, hate
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 嫌い expresses a strong dislike or hatred for something, but it does not necessarily imply a
      lack of ability or skill. You can be 嫌い of something you are good at, or good at something you 嫌い.
      While 苦手 often involves dislike, it's often a dislike *because* one is bad at it or finds it unpleasant.
      嫌い is solely about preference.
    grammar_point: '[Noun]が嫌いだ (to dislike)'
  - term: 好きではない (すきではない)
    meaning: do not like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is a milder expression of dislike compared to 嫌い. Like 嫌い, it is about preference and
      does not directly relate to one's skill or ability. It simply states a lack of fondness, without
      the deeper aversion or personal struggle implied by 苦手.
    grammar_point: '[Noun]が好きだ (to like)'
  - term: 得意ではない (とくいではない)
    meaning: not good at, not one's strong point
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 得意 (tokui) means 'good at' or 'one's strong point.' Therefore, 得意ではない means 'not good at'
      or 'not my forte.' This expression is often closer to 苦手 in meaning, as it indicates something is
      not a strength. However, 苦手 often implies a more significant emotional or psychological barrier
      (aversion, discomfort) than 得意ではない, which can be a more neutral statement of a skill not being a
      strength.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:得意ではない (not good at)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'To avoid confusing 苦手 with similar expressions, remember its core nuance:
  it''s not just about a lack of skill (下手), nor is it purely about preference (嫌い or 好きではない). 苦手 implies
  a personal struggle, discomfort, or aversion, whether physical, emotional, or psychological, that goes
  beyond mere inability or simple dislike. When you are 苦手 at something, there''s often a feeling of ''I
  wish I weren''t like this'' or ''this makes me uncomfortable.'' 得意ではない is the most similar, but it can
  be a more objective and less emotionally charged statement of not excelling in something.'

        english: I am unskillful at English.
        hint: While technically correct, 下手 implies a general lack of skill. 苦手 suggests a personal struggle
          or discomfort, perhaps due to shyness or anxiety, not just an objective lack of ability. We're
          looking for an expression that conveys personal aversion or difficulty.

        english: My older sister dislikes bugs, so she screamed when she saw a cockroach.
        hint: While 'dislikes' is true, 「苦手」specifically conveys a strong, almost phobic aversion to bugs,
          which often leads to reactions like screaming. It's more about the discomfort or fear than just
          a general dislike. We're looking for an expression that describes a strong aversion or fear.

        english: I dislike waking up early in the morning, so waking up before 6 AM is truly painful.

        english: I am unskillful at remembering people's faces, so I often make mistakes.
        hint: While 「下手」could be used, 「苦手」emphasizes a personal difficulty or struggle with this specific
          task, rather than just a general lack of a 'skill' in memory. It conveys a frustrating personal
          weakness. We're looking for an expression that describes a personal struggle or weakness.

  a personal struggle, discomfort, or aversion, whether physical, emotional, or psychological. Pay attention
  to the context to fully grasp the nuance—it's rarely just about being 'bad' in a technical sense, but
  rather about finding something genuinely difficult or unpleasant to engage with.
