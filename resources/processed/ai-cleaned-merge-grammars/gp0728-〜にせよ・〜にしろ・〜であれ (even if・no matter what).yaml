jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Primarily used to acknowledge a condition or possibility while asserting that it does
    not alter the main statement or conclusion. 「であれ」 often implies strong conviction or universal applicability,
    especially with interrogatives. The paired form implies dismissal of alternatives.
  function: To acknowledge a condition or possibility while asserting that it does not alter the main
    statement or conclusion. For 「であれ/であろうと」, it often expresses a strong conviction or universal truth
    regardless of the condition.
  nuance: These expressions concede a condition or possibility while asserting it does not alter the main
    statement or conclusion. They often imply a dismissal of the conceded condition's importance. 「にせよ」
    is generally more formal and often appears in written contexts, whereas 「にしろ」 is more colloquial and
    frequently heard in spoken Japanese. In paired constructions (Xにせよ Yにせよ / Xにしろ Yにしろ), they emphasize
    that regardless of the presented alternatives, the main point remains unchanged, conveying a sense
    of dismissal of the options' importance to the overall conclusion. 「であれ」 and 「であろうと」 convey a stronger,
    more definitive, and often universal assertion, indicating that a certain truth or resolution stands
    firm regardless of the stated condition. They are highly formal, often used in written Japanese or
    speeches, and can be perceived as stiff or rigid, particularly when used in paired constructions (Xであれ
    Yであれ).
  grammatical-role: Concessive or conditional
etymology: 「にせよ」 and 「にしろ」 are derived from the particle 「に」 (indicating cause or condition) combined
  with the imperative forms 「せよ」 and 「しろ」 of the verb 「する」 (to do). Historically, these imperative forms
  could function to concede a point, similar to 'let it be so' or 'granted that.' This structure conveys
  a sense of "even if it were the case that...", implying that a condition is granted but deemed irrelevant
  to the main point. 「であれ」 and 「であろうと」 originate from 「である」, the formal copula. 「であれ」 is derived from
  the imperative form of 「ある」 (to be/exist), while 「であろうと」 combines the volitional form of 「ある」 with the
  particle 「と」. When used, especially in paired structures, they emphasize a definitive truth that holds
  "so it is (A), (B) still won't be affected," conveying strong conviction or universal applicability,
  and that the result or conclusion remains unchanged irrespective of the options presented.
writeup: "The grammar point 「〜にせよ・〜にしろ・〜であれ」 is used to acknowledge a condition or possibility, while\
  \ asserting that it does not change or alter the main statement or conclusion. It's often employed to\
  \ convey a sense of dismissal regarding the importance of the preceding condition, suggesting that \"\
  even if this is true, it doesn't matter\" or \"so what if it is?\" This makes it a powerful tool for\
  \ maintaining the validity of a statement regardless of external factors. \n\n**Usage and Nuances of\
  \ 「にせよ / にしろ」:**\nThese forms are commonly used to make a concession. They combine the particle 「に」\
  \ with the imperative forms 「せよ」 or 「しろ」 of the verb 「する」. While both mean \"even if\" or \"no matter,\"\
  \ 「にせよ」 is generally more formal and often appears in written contexts, whereas 「にしろ」 is more colloquial\
  \ and frequently heard in spoken Japanese. They can follow verbs (plain form), い-adjectives (plain form),\
  \ な-adjectives (stem, optionally with 「だ / である / だった / であった」), nouns (optionally with 「だ / である / だった\
  \ / であった」), or adverbs. \n\nWhen used in a paired construction (e.g., 「Xにせよ Yにせよ」 or 「Xにしろ Yにしろ」), these\
  \ forms explicitly state \"whether X or Y.\" This pattern emphasizes that regardless of the two presented\
  \ alternatives, the main point or outcome remains unchanged. X and Y are often opposing concepts or\
  \ antonyms (e.g., positive/negative, good/bad), and the structure effectively dismisses the importance\
  \ of these specific options to the overall conclusion. It implies that for both extremes and anything\
  \ in between, the main statement holds true. While grammatically permissible to mix 「にせよ」 and 「にしろ」,\
  \ it is generally considered unnatural. Therefore, when using this pattern, it is important to consistently\
  \ use either 「にしろ〜にしろ」 or 「にせよ〜にせよ」. \n\n**Usage and Nuances of 「であれ / であろうと」:**\nThese are highly formal\
  \ expressions that convey a strong, definitive assertion or a universal truth that holds true regardless\
  \ of the stated condition. 「であれ」 and 「であろうと」 are derived from the formal copula 「である」 and often attach\
  \ to nouns and な-adjective stems. They are particularly common when paired with interrogative words\
  \ like 「どんなに」 (no matter how much), 「いかに」 (how, no matter how), or 「何」 (what, no matter what) to emphasize\
  \ \"no matter how/what\" a certain condition is. This usage implies that the condition is utterly irrelevant\
  \ to the main point, which stands as an unchangeable truth. \n\nLike 「にせよ/にしろ」, 「であれ / であろうと」 can also\
  \ be used in paired constructions (e.g., 「Xであれ Yであれ」 or 「Xであろうと Yであろうと」). This usage emphasizes universal\
  \ applicability across all presented options, often sounding more decisive and less conversational than\
  \ the 「にしろ」 forms. Due to their formal and rigid nature, these forms are frequently found in written\
  \ Japanese, official statements, or speeches where strong conviction and universality need to be conveyed.\
  \ \n\n**Common Function:**\nAll variants serve to concede a point, yet dismiss its impact on the main\
  \ assertion. They allow the speaker to acknowledge a specific situation or possibility without letting\
  \ it diminish the weight or truth of their primary statement. The choice between 「にせよ/にしろ」 and 「であれ/であろうと」\
  \ largely depends on the desired level of formality and the specific nuance of dismissal or universal\
  \ truth one wishes to convey."
false_friends:
  - term: にしても〜にしても
    meaning: Regardless of whether, Even if X, Even if Y
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「にしろ〜にしろ」, but 「にしても」 can carry a slight nuance of concession or acknowledgment,
      implying 'even if that's the case, still...'. It often presents the possibilities as things to be
      considered, rather than just dismissed as irrelevant.
    grammar_point: にしても〜にしても (regardless of whether a or b)
  - term: 〜かどうか
    meaning: Whether or not, If...or not
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Used to express uncertainty or a question about two possibilities. It lacks the strong nuance
      of 'it doesn't matter, the outcome is fixed' that 「にしろ〜にしろ」 has, as 「かどうか」 implies a decision or
      a fact yet to be determined.
    grammar_point: かどうか (whether or not)
  - term: 〜でも 〜でも
    meaning: Whether ~ or ~, Neither ~ nor ~
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Can be used to indicate that something is true in either case, or to simply list items. It
      can mean 'both X and Y' or 'neither X nor Y' depending on context, but it lacks the explicit comparative
      dismissal of possibilities inherent in 「にしろ〜にしろ」.
    grammar_point: でも〜でも (whether x or y)
  - term: 〜ても〜なくても
    meaning: Whether ~ or not, Even if ~ even if not ~
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「にしろ〜にしろ」 but often puts more emphasis on the action or state being considered
      as a conditional. It implies an allowance ('even if this happens...') rather than a direct assertion
      that the conditions are irrelevant to the overall outcome.
    grammar_point: 〜ても〜なくても (whether or not)
  - term: にかかわらず
    meaning: Regardless of, irrespective of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: More formal and often used in written contexts, or for broader, more general statements. Unlike
      「にしろ〜にしろ」, it doesn't explicitly present two contrasting options but rather states a general condition
      under which something holds true. It lacks the conversational and emphatic nuance of dismissing
      specific alternatives.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:にかかわらず (regardless of)
  - term: とはいえ
    meaning: Though, Although (I admit that), be that as it may, nonetheless
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Used to concede a point before making a contrasting statement. It introduces a counter-argument
      or clarification rather than directly comparing two possibilities and deeming them irrelevant to
      the main point.
    grammar_point: とはいえ (though)
  - term: 何しろ
    meaning: Anyway, after all, in any case; used to emphasize the reason or inevitability of a situation.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: An adverbial phrase used to provide a reason or justification, or to emphasize a situation.
      It does not function as a comparative structure to state 'whether X or Y', and its meaning is entirely
      different from this grammar point.
    grammar_point: 何しろ (anyway・after all)
  - term: たところで
    meaning: Even if ~ cannot or will not, Even though ~ not
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Often implies a negative or undesirable outcome or a sense of futility, even with the conceded
      condition being true.
    grammar_point: (にし)たところで (even if)
  - term: ても
    meaning: Even if, Even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: A more general concessive form. It lacks the strong dismissal of irrelevance found in 「にせよ・にしろ」,
      and also the formal, definitive assertion of unchangeable truth present in 「であれ」.
    grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
  - term: にしても
    meaning: Even though, Even if, Even when, Also
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Often includes an element of surprise or unexpectedness regarding the conceded condition,
      suggesting that it's surprising but doesn't change the main point. This element of surprise is not
      as central to this grammar point, which focuses more on simple irrelevance or universal truth.
    grammar_point: にしても (even if)
  - term: たとえ〜ても
    meaning: Even if…is the case, Supposing that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: A more formal and hypothetical expression, often used for conditions that are imagined or
      not necessarily true. This grammar point can apply to both hypothetical and actual conditions, with
      a stronger emphasis on the irrelevance or definitive nature of the main assertion.
    grammar_point: たとえ〜ても (even if)
  - term: どうしても
    meaning: Regardless of; no matter what
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Carries a sense of determination and inevitability, emphasizing the speaker's strong will
      or an unavoidable situation, rather than simply acknowledging and dismissing a condition or stating
      a universal truth like this grammar point.
    grammar_point: どうしても (inevitably or absolutely)
  - term: を問わず
    meaning: Regardless of; irrespective of; without reference to; whether or not; no matter
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Emphasizes that something is entirely irrelevant or not a factor in a situation, often used
      in official statements or general rules. While this grammar point also implies irrelevance, it is
      more about the speaker's concession or strong assertion regarding a specific condition, sometimes
      with a 'who cares' attitude or a definitive truth.
    grammar_point: '[Noun]を問わず (regardless of)'
  - term: 〜でも
    meaning: Even; or something; any (with question words); no matter (who/what/where/when)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: A more general and less formal way to express concession or 'no matter' compared to this grammar
      point. It lacks the strong dismissal of irrelevance and the formal, assertive tone of an unchangeable
      truth that this grammar point carries.
    grammar_point: でも (even・any・no matter)
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions all deal with concession or conditions, their nuances
  vary significantly. This grammar point is distinguished by its direct and often forceful dismissal of
  the preceding condition's importance in relation to the main statement, or by its strong assertion of
  a universal truth. It is primarily used for presenting contrasting possibilities and asserting that
  the main statement remains true regardless of which of the two is the case. When choosing an expression,
  consider whether you want to simply state that something is not a factor (such as with 「を問わず」), imply
  an undesirable outcome (such as with 「たところで」), or acknowledge a condition to emphasize a primary, often
  unyielding, point. Understanding these subtle differences is key to fluent and natural Japanese communication.
  For highly formal, objective, or authoritative contexts, the 「であれ」 forms are suitable. In more common
  or slightly less rigid situations, the 「にしろ」 or 「にせよ」 forms are better alternatives. Remember that other
  expressions may focus on uncertainty, concession, or providing reasons, so pay attention to the specific
  nuance and communicative intent. Avoid using 「とはいえ」 or 「何しろ」 as substitutes, as they convey different
  logical relationships and usage patterns.
examples:
  - english: No matter what happens, I will definitely finish this job.
    japanese:
      - 何 が 起きる {に せよ}、この 仕事 は 必ず 終わら せる。
      - 何 が 起きる {に せよ}、この 仕事 は 必ず 終わら せ ます。
      - 何 が 起きる {に しろ}、この 仕事 は 必ず 終わら せる。
      - 何 が 起きる {に しろ}、この 仕事 は 必ず 終わら せ ます。
    english_literally: No matter what happens, this job I will definitely finish.

          - 何 が 起き {て も}、この 仕事 は 必ず 終わら せる。
        english: Even if something happens, I will definitely finish this job.
        hint: The programmer is expressing a strong, unwavering commitment. 「にせよ」 here suggests that any
          potential issues are already considered and dismissed as irrelevant to the ultimate goal, conveying
          a more decisive resolve than a simple 「〜ても」. We're looking for an expression that emphasizes
          that the condition does not change the main point.
    scene: A dedicated programmer is working late into the night, determined to meet a project deadline
      despite unforeseen obstacles.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: The speaker is emphasizing their determination to complete the task, implying that any difficulties
      or events that might occur (「何が 起きる」) are secondary and will not deter them. This highlights the
      'dismissal' nuance of 「にせよ」. The casual register is conveyed by the plain ending 「終わらせる」. For a
      more polite tone, one would use 「終わらせます」.
  - english: Even if it's expensive, I really want that house.
    japanese:
      - た と え 高い {に せよ}、どう し て も あの 家 が 欲しい。
      - た と え 高い {に せよ}、どう し て も あの 家 が 欲しい です。
      - た と え 高い {に しろ}、どう し て も あの 家 が 欲しい。
      - た と え 高い {に しろ}、どう し て も あの 家 が 欲しい です。
    english_literally: Even if it's expensive, no matter what I want that house.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - た と え 高く {て も}、どう し て も あの 家 が 欲しい。
        english: Even if it's expensive, I really want that house.
        hint: The speaker acknowledges the high cost but states their desire as absolute. 「にせよ」 implies
          that the price, while a factor, does not diminish their strong longing, making the desire sound
          more profound than if 「ても」 were used. We're looking for an expression that conveys a strong
          desire despite a recognized drawback, where the drawback is considered but doesn't change the
          core desire.
    scene: A man is looking at a real estate listing with his wife, expressing a strong desire for a house
      that might be beyond their budget.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The sentence uses the plain non-past form of an い-adjective (高い). The speaker is expressing
      a deep, unwavering desire for something despite a recognized drawback (its high cost). The use of
      「にせよ」 conveys that this drawback is considered but does not change the core desire, making the statement
      more emphatic than simply 「高くても」. While 「欲しい」 itself can be casual or polite, the overall tone leans
      towards semi-formal in this intimate setting, especially when followed by 「です」 for politeness.
  - english: Even if he is famous, in front of us, he is nothing more than an individual.
    japanese:
      - 彼 が 有名 で ある {に しろ}、我々 の 前 で は 一 個人 に 過ぎ ませ ん。
      - 彼 が 有名 で ある {に せよ}、我々 の 前 で は 一 個人 に 過ぎ ませ ん。
      - 彼 が 有名 {に しろ}、俺 たち の 前 で は 一 個人 に 過ぎ ない。
      - 彼 が 有名 {に せよ}、俺 たち の 前 で は 一 個人 に 過ぎ ない。

        english: Even if he is famous, in front of us, he is nothing more than an individual.
        hint: The team leader is leveling the playing field and preventing employees from being overly
          impressed or intimidated. 「にしろ」 emphasizes that the client's fame is irrelevant to how they
          are to be treated professionally, reinforcing a standard of conduct. We're looking for an expression
          that asserts a person's status or condition is inconsequential to their treatment in a given
          context.
    scene: A team leader addresses new employees, setting expectations for how they should treat a celebrity
      client, emphasizing professionalism over celebrity status.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: This example uses a な-adjective (有名) followed by 「である にしろ」. The speaker is asserting that
      a person's fame is inconsequential to their status within the professional context, treating them
      as an equal. The nuance here is a polite but firm dismissal of the fame as a factor. The use of
      「我々」 and 「過ぎません」 contributes to the formal register. In more casual speech, one might drop 「である」
      and use plain endings like 「過ぎない」 with 「俺たち」.
  - english: Even if it's very slow, do it carefully without rushing.
    japanese:
      - どんな に ゆっくり {に せよ}、焦ら ず 丁寧 に やり なさい。
      - どんな に ゆっくり {に せよ}、焦ら ず 丁寧 に やれ。
      - どんな に ゆっくり {に しろ}、焦ら ず 丁寧 に やり なさい。
      - どんな に ゆっくり {に しろ}、焦ら ず 丁寧 に やれ。
    english_literally: No matter how slowly, without rushing, do it carefully.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - どんな に ゆっくり {で も}、焦ら ず 丁寧 に やり なさい。
        english: Even if it's a very slow, do it carefully without rushing.
        hint: The craftsman wants to reassure the apprentice that speed is not the priority, but quality
          is. 「にせよ」 clearly communicates that 'slowness' is an acceptable condition, reinforcing the importance
          of care rather than speed. We're looking for an expression that prioritizes precision over speed,
          making it clear that the pace is a minor consideration compared to the quality of work.
    scene: An experienced craftsman is instructing a novice apprentice on how to perform a delicate task,
      prioritizing precision over speed.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: instructional
    nuance: This sentence uses an adverb (ゆっくり) followed by 「にせよ」. The craftsman is prioritizing carefulness
      over speed, making it clear that the pace (「ゆっくり」) is a minor consideration compared to the quality
      of work. This emphasizes the speaker's core instruction, while conceding a less ideal condition.
      The ending 「やりなさい」 is a polite imperative, fitting a semi-formal instructional setting. For a more
      direct, casual instruction, 「やれ」 would be used.
  - english: Even if it's an old story, it still moves people's hearts.
    japanese:
      - 古い 話 {に せよ}、今 なお 人々 の 心 を 動かす。
      - 古い 話 {に しろ}、今 なお 人々 の 心 を 動かす。
      - 古い 話 で ある {に せよ}、今 なお 人々 の 心 を 動かし ます。
      - 古い 話 で ある {に しろ}、今 なお 人々 の 心 を 動かし ます。
    english_literally: Even if old story, still now moves people's hearts.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 古い 話 {で も}、今 なお 人々 の 心 を 動かす。
        english: Even if it's an old story, it still moves people's hearts.
        hint: While 「〜でも」 means 'even if', 「にせよ・にしろ」 here concedes the 'old' aspect but dismisses it as
          a factor against its enduring emotional impact. We're looking for an expression that highlights
          the timeless quality of the narrative, regardless of its age.
    scene: A literary critic is discussing the enduring appeal of classic literature.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: This example uses an い-adjective (古い) modifying a noun (話). It highlights that the age of
      the story is irrelevant to its emotional impact, focusing on the timeless quality of the narrative.
      The plain ending 「動かす」 is common in analytical or academic discourse, while 「動かします」 provides a polite
      option for a semi-formal informative setting. Using 「である」 before 「にせよ・にしろ」 with a noun adds a more
      formal or declarative tone.
  - english: Whether you're a student or a working adult, learning new things is important.
    japanese:
      - 学生 {に しろ} 社会 人 {に しろ}、新し い こと を 学ぶ こと は 大切 です。
      - 学生 {に せよ} 社会 人 {に せよ}、新し い こと を 学ぶ こと は 大切 です。
      - 学生 {に しろ} 社会 人 {に しろ}、新し い こと を 学ぶ の は 大切 だ。
      - 学生 {に せよ} 社会 人 {に せよ}、新し い こと を 学ぶ の は 重要 だ。
    english_literally: Student [whether] working adult [whether], new things to learn is important.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 学生 {も} 社会 人 {も}、新し い こと を 学ぶ こと は 大切 です。
        english: Both students and working adults, learning new things is important.
        hint: 「〜も〜も」 simply lists two items as being true, but it doesn't carry the nuance of 'regardless
          of whether you are X or Y'. 「にしろ〜にしろ」 emphasizes that the importance of learning transcends
          occupational or academic status. We're looking for a structure that asserts the universal importance
          of learning for either group.
    scene: A motivational speaker giving advice to a mixed audience.
    register: formal
    setting: inspirational
    nuance: This example uses nouns (学生 and 社会 人) to convey that the importance of learning is universal,
      irrespective of one's professional or academic status. The formal register suits a motivational
      speech or an educational setting, where the speaker wants to convey a broad, undeniable truth to
      a diverse audience. Using 「〜こと は 大切 です」 or 「〜の は 重要 だ」 adds to the authoritative yet encouraging
      tone.
  - english: Whether the meal is delicious or not, it's good manners to eat everything without leaving
      anything.

        english: Even if the meal is delicious or not, it's good manners to eat everything without leaving
          anything.
        hint: 「〜ても〜なくても」 indicates a conditional allowance. 「にしろ〜にしろ」 makes a stronger assertion that
          the rule of good manners applies universally, irrespective of the meal's taste. We're looking
          for a phrase that indicates the manner of eating is a rule independent of how the food tastes.
    scene: A parent teaching a child about table manners at dinner.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: instructional
    nuance: This illustrates a rule that applies regardless of subjective experience (deliciousness of
      the meal). The semi-formal register is appropriate for gentle instruction from a parent or guardian
      to a child, emphasizing a social expectation. The informal ending 「〜だよ」 would make it more direct
      and casual if spoken within the family, but 「〜です」 maintains a teaching, somewhat polite tone.
  - english: Whether there was a result or not, his effort should be highly evaluated.
    japanese:
      - どんな 結果 に なっ た {に しろ} なら なかっ た {に しろ}、彼 の 努力 は 高く 評価 さ れる べき だ。
      - どんな 結果 に なっ た {に せよ} なら なかっ た {に せよ}、彼 の 努力 は 高く 評価 さ れる べき だ。
      - どんな 結果 に なっ た {に しろ} なら なかっ た {に しろ}、彼 の 努力 は 高く 評価 さ れる べき で ある。
    english_literally: What kind of result became [whether] did not become [whether], his effort highly
      evaluate should be.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - どんな 結果 に {なろう が} {なかろう が}、彼 の 努力 は 高く 評価 さ れる べき だ。
        english: Whatever the result may be, his effort should be highly evaluated.
        hint: 「〜が〜まいが」 is a strong, slightly more formal expression for 'whether X happens or not'. 「にしろ〜にしろ」
          offers a common and slightly less formal way to emphasize that the outcome of a past event doesn't
          negate the value of the effort. We're looking for a way to say his effort should be valued regardless
          of the outcome.
    scene: A coach or mentor reflecting on a team member's performance after a competition.
    register: formal
    setting: supportive
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: This example uses the past tense of a verb (なった/ならなかった) to show that the evaluation of effort
      is separate from the outcome. The supportive setting emphasizes the value of the process, suggesting
      that the effort itself holds intrinsic worth, regardless of the final achievement. The use of 「べきだ」
      or 「べきである」 indicates a strong recommendation or moral imperative.
  - english: Whether we end up moving or not, let's organize the room early.
    japanese:
      - 結局 引越し する {に しろ} し ない {に しろ}、早め に 部屋 を 整理 しよう。
      - 結局 引越し する {に せよ} し ない {に せよ}、早め に 部屋 を 整理 し ましょう。
      - 結局 引越し する {に しろ} し ない {に しろ}、早め に 部屋 を 片付けよう。
    english_literally: In the end moving do [whether] do not do [whether], early room organize let's.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 結局 引越し {する か} {し ない か}、早め に 部屋 を 整理 しよう。
        english: Whether we move or not, let's organize the room early.
        hint: 「〜か〜か」 implies uncertainty or a question about two possibilities. 「にしろ〜にしろ」 clearly states
          that the action (organizing the room) should be done regardless of the uncertain future event
          (moving or not moving). We're looking for a phrase that stresses that the room should be organized
          regardless of the moving decision.
    scene: Roommates or a couple discussing their living situation and chores.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: This implies a pragmatic approach to a future uncertain event (moving). The casual register
      fits a conversation between roommates or partners, focusing on a shared responsibility. The inclusion
      of 「結局」 (in the end/after all) can add a sense of resignation or practicality, acknowledging that
      the outcome of moving is still up in the air.
  - english: Whether you agree or disagree, you should listen to everyone's opinions.
    japanese:
      - 賛成 {に しろ} 反対 {に しろ}、皆 の 意見 を 聞く べき だ。

      - 賛成 {に しろ} 反対 {に しろ}、全員 の 意見 を 聞く べき だ。
    english_literally: Agreement [whether] opposition [whether], everyone's opinion listen should.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{賛成 で あつ て も} {反対 で あつ て も}、皆 の 意見 を 聞く べき だ。'
        english: Even if you agree or disagree, you should listen to everyone's opinions.
        hint: 「〜であっても」 is a concessive form, meaning 'even if it is X'. 「にしろ〜にしろ」 directly compares the
          two stances and dismisses their relevance to the act of listening, emphasizing that listening
          is always necessary. We're looking for a statement that hearing all opinions is necessary regardless
          of one's stance.
    scene: A team leader encouraging open discussion during a meeting.
    register: formal
    setting: persuasive
    nuance: Here, nouns (賛成 and 反対) are used to indicate that the act of listening is crucial, regardless
      of one's stance. This is a common phrase to promote inclusivity in group discussions or during decision-making
      processes, emphasizing the importance of open-mindedness and fair consideration of all viewpoints.
      The use of 「べきだ」 reinforces this as a moral or practical necessity.
  - english: Whether you are a doctor or a patient, wearing a mask inside the hospital is necessary.
    japanese:
      - 医者 {に しろ} 患者 {に しろ}、病院 内 で の マスク 着用 は 必要 です。
      - 医者 {に せよ} 患者 {に せよ}、病院 内 で の マスク 着用 は 必要 です。
      - 医者 {に しろ} 患者 {に しろ}、病院 内 で の マスク 着用 は 不可欠 です。
    english_literally: Doctor [whether] patient [whether], hospital inside of mask wearing is necessary.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{医者 で あろう と} {患者 で あろう と}、病院 内 で の マスク 着用 は 必要 です。'
        english: Whether one is a doctor or a patient, wearing a mask inside the hospital is necessary.
        hint: 「〜であろうと〜であろうと」 is a very formal and emphatic way to say 'whether X or Y', often used in
          official contexts. 「にしろ〜にしろ」 serves a similar purpose but can be used more broadly in both formal
          and semi-formal settings, effectively stating that the rule applies to both categories without
          exception. We're looking for a phrase that indicates the mask rule applies to everyone inside
          the hospital, no matter their role.
    scene: A public announcement or sign at a hospital entrance regarding health regulations.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: This statement uses nouns to convey a universally applicable rule within a specific environment
      (hospital). The formal register is appropriate for official regulations, public announcements, or
      written signs, where clarity and universality are paramount. The use of 「必要です」 or 「不可欠です」 emphasizes
      the non-negotiable nature of the rule for safety or compliance.
  - english: Whether it was tough or fun, high school life won't come back anymore, you know.
    japanese:
      - どんな に 辛かっ た {に しろ} 楽しかっ た {に しろ}、高校 生活 は もう 戻ら ない の よ。
      - どんな に 辛かっ た {に せよ} 楽しかっ た {に せよ}、高校 生活 は もう 戻ら ない の よ。
      - どんな に 辛かっ た {に しろ} 楽しかっ た {に しろ}、高校 生活 は もう 戻り ませ ん。
      - どんな に 辛かっ た {に しろ} 楽しかっ た {に しろ}、高校 生活 は もう 戻ら ない ん だ。
    english_literally: No matter how tough was [whether] fun was [whether], high school life anymore will
      not return, you know.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - どんな に {辛く て も} {楽しく て も}、高校 生活 は もう 戻ら ない の よ。
        english: No matter how tough or fun it was, high school life won't come back anymore, you know.
        hint: 「〜くても〜くても」 indicates 'even if it's X or even if it's Y'. While similar, 「にしろ〜にしろ」 explicitly
          puts the two contrasting experiences side-by-side to emphasize that neither changes the fundamental
          truth that high school life is over. We're looking for a phrase that implies the past cannot
          be revisited, regardless of how it was experienced.
    scene: An older woman giving advice to a younger female friend about looking back on her past.
    register: shitashii kuchō (intimate)
    setting: melancholic
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The sentence ends with 「の よ」 or 「んだ」, common sentence-final particles used by women to add
      a gentle, explanatory, or slightly emotional nuance. The tone is reflective and slightly melancholic,
      as the older woman imparts a truth about the past to her younger friend. The use of 「どんな に」 (no
      matter how much) further emphasizes the irrelevance of the intensity of the experience to the outcome,
      highlighting the finality of time passing. The phrase 「もう 戻ら ない」 emphasizes that it will not return.
  - english: No matter how difficult the situation, it's important to remain calm.
    japanese:
      - どんな に 厳しい 状況 {で あれ}、冷静 さ を 保つ こと が 重要 だ。
      - どんな に 厳しい 状況 {で あろう と}、冷静 さ を 保つ こと が 重要 だ。
    english_literally: Even if it is any difficult situation, maintaining calmness is important.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - どんな に 厳しい 状況 {で も}、冷静 さ を 保つ こと が 重要 だ。
        english: Even if the situation is difficult, it's important to remain calm.
        hint: 「〜でも」 is a common, less formal way to say 'even if' or 'no matter', but 「であれ」 is more formal
          and emphasizes a strong, unchangeable truth regardless of the condition. We're looking for a
          formal, assertive tone.
    scene: A crisis management expert giving advice to a team.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The use of 「どんなに〜であれ」 emphasizes the universality of the advice, suggesting that calmness
      is critical in any severe situation. The choice of 「重要だ」 adds a sense of objective truth.
    etymology: The phrase 「冷静 さ を 保つ」 (reiseiteki sa o tamotsu) literally means "to maintain calmness,"
      stressing self-control under pressure. This expression is commonly used to highlight the importance
      of composure in challenging circumstances, underscoring a virtue of self-control prevalent in Japanese
      culture for effective problem-solving and decision-making. Its direct and functional meaning makes
      it versatile across various formal and instructional contexts, from business to martial arts, where
      maintaining a clear mind is crucial for optimal performance and decision-making.
  - english: Whatever his actions may have been, he is responsible for the consequences.
    japanese:
      - 彼 の 行為 が 何 {で あろう と}、その 結果 に 対する 責任 は 彼 に ある。
      - 彼 の 行為 が 何 {で あれ}、その 結果 に 対する 責任 は 彼 に ある。
    english_literally: Even if his actions are what they are, responsibility for those results is on him.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 行為 が 何 {で あっ て も}、その 結果 に 対する 責任 は 彼 に ある。
        english: Even if his actions are whatever they are, he is responsible for the consequences.
        hint: 「〜であっても」 conveys 'even if it is', but 「であろうと」 carries a stronger, more definitive, and often
          more formal tone, asserting the condition regardless of what it might be. We're looking for
          a strong assertion of the condition.
    scene: A judge explaining legal principles in court.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「何 であろうと」 highlights the irrelevance of the specific actions themselves, focusing solely on
      the accountability for the outcome. The phrase 「責任 は 彼 に ある」 places clear, undeniable responsibility.
    etymology: '「責任」 (sekinin) combines 「責」 (responsibility) and 「任」 (duty), emphasizing the burden of
      accountability. This compound word succinctly captures the essence of legal and moral accountability,
      reflecting a Japanese cultural emphasis on fulfilling one''s obligations. The characters themselves
      hint at the depth of the concept: 「責」 evokes a sense of blame or duty, while 「任」 signifies a task
      or burden. This combination portrays responsibility not just as a consequence but as an entrusted
      duty that must be upheld.'
  - english: No matter how difficult the situation, I am determined to achieve this goal.
    japanese:
      - いかに 困難 な 状況 {で あれ}、私 は この 目標 を 達成 する 決意 だ。

        english: No matter how difficult the situation, I am determined to achieve this goal.
        hint: 「〜でも」 can express 'no matter how', but 「であれ」 conveys a more determined and formal resolve,
          especially when stating a strong will. We're looking for a firm declaration of intent.
    scene: A politician giving a resolute speech during a campaign.
    register: formal
    setting: persuasive
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「いかに〜であれ」 is paired with 「決意だ」 to convey a powerful and unwavering commitment. The phrase
      「困難な状況」 emphasizes the difficulty that will be overcome, underscoring the speaker's determination.
    etymology: 「決意」 (ketsui) combines 「決」 (to decide) and 「意」 (will/mind), signifying a firm resolution.
  - english: Whether it's a nation or a corporation, transparency is key to building trust.
    japanese:
      - 国家 {で あれ} 企業 {で あれ}、透明 性 が 信頼 構築 の 鍵 で ある。

        english: Whether it's a nation or a corporation, transparency is key to building trust.
        hint: The formal context of a political analysis requires a more objective and authoritative expression
          like 「であれ」, rather than the more common and less formal 「でも」. We're looking for a statement
          with a highly formal tone.
    scene: A political analyst discussing governance.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: imperative plain (～ろ/～え)
    nuance: The use of 「であれ」 here conveys that the statement about transparency is an objective truth
      applicable universally, regardless of whether it's a nation or a corporation, which is characteristic
      of formal analytical discourse.
  - english: Whether it's joy or sorrow, emotions are part of the human experience.

        english: Whether it's joy or sorrow, emotions are part of the human experience.
        hint: In an academic or informative lecture, 「であれ」 is preferred for its formal, objective tone,
          suitable for presenting a universal truth or concept, differentiating it from the more casual
          「でも」. We're looking for an academic and objective statement.
    scene: A psychologist giving a public lecture on human emotions.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: imperative plain (～ろ/～え)
    nuance: This statement uses 「であれ」 to articulate a fundamental truth about human nature. It presents
      joy and sorrow as equally integral parts of the human emotional spectrum, lending an academic and
      authoritative tone to the observation.
  - english: Whether experienced or inexperienced, safety regulations must be observed.
    japanese:
      - 経験 者 {で あろう と} 未 経験 者 {で あろう と}、安全 規定 は 遵守 し なけれ ば なら ない。

        english: Whether experienced or inexperienced, safety regulations must be observed.
        hint: In a critical safety briefing, the authoritative and non-negotiable tone conveyed by 「であろうと」

          rules. We're looking for a mandatory and authoritative instruction.

    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: volitional (～よう)
    listener_gender: group

      for everyone on site, regardless of their background. This choice of expression emphasizes the universal

        hint: When discussing abstract concepts like art and its evolution, 「であれ」 offers a more academic

    setting: informative
    conjugation: imperative plain (～ろ/～え)
    nuance: The chef's use of 「であれ」 here emphasizes that the joy derived from delicious food is universal,
      transcending cultural or stylistic differences. This objective and somewhat formal tone is appropriate
      when expressing a general principle in a professional context.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「にせよ」「にしろ」「であれ」「であろうと」, and their variants like 「であろうが」,
  are employed across different contexts. They consistently underscore a speaker's intent to either dismiss
  a preceding condition as irrelevant to the main point or to acknowledge it as one of several possibilities
  that still lead to the same conclusion. When using the paired 「にしろ〜にしろ」 form, ensure the alternatives
  are genuinely contrasting and cover the range of possibilities for which the main statement holds true;
  this construction is very effective for dismissing the relevance of these variations to the ultimate
  conclusion. The choice between 「にせよ」 (more formal/written) and 「にしろ」 (more casual/spoken), and the overall
  formality and strong assertion implied by 「であれ」 and 「であろうと」, helps match the appropriate register and
  nuance. Remember that 「であろうが」 can provide a slightly more emphatic or resigned tone, depending on the
  context.
