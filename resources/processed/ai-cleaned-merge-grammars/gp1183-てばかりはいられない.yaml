        "Verb[て形] + ばかりはいられない": "Indicates that one cannot indefinitely continue a specific action or state.",

        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "nuance": "Expresses a sense of urgency or necessity to change one's actions or situation.",
        "source": "resources/original/dojg/all/てばかりはいられない.yaml",
        "colocation": "Often appears with expressions of time or extent, such as 「いつまでも」 (forever), 「毎日」 (every day), or 「現状維持」 (maintaining the status quo).",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a fixed phrase ending a clause, indicating a constraint or necessity to move beyond a current state or action.",
        "logical-flow": "Implies a shift from a current, unsustainable state or action to a necessary new course, often driven by external pressures or internal realization.",
        "temporal-flow": "Suggests that a current action or state, if continued, would be inappropriate or detrimental, thus requiring a timely change. It denotes a point of realization or decision to stop a prolonged activity or state."
    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the 「て」 form of a verb with 「ばかり」 (meaning 'only' or 'just'), 「は」 (the topic marker), and 「いられない」 (the negative potential form of 「いる」, meaning 'cannot stay/continue'). The overall structure conveys that one cannot remain doing only one thing or stay in the same state.",
    "writeup": "「てばかりはいられない」 indicates that one **cannot continue** doing something or remain in a particular state indefinitely. It implies a need to change, move forward, or take action. The nuance suggests a sense of urgency or that the current situation is unsustainable. It is a versatile expression, suitable for formal speeches, writing, and everyday conversation, conveying a need to transition from a current state to a different course of action.",
