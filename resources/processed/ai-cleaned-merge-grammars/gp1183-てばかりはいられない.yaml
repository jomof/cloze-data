    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the 「て」 form of a verb with 「ばかり」 (meaning 'only' or 'just'), 「は」 (the topic marker), and 「いられない」 (the negative potential form of 「いる」, meaning 'cannot stay/continue'). The overall structure conveys that one cannot remain doing only one thing or stay in the same state.",
    "writeup": "「てばかりはいられない」 indicates that one **cannot continue** doing something or remain in a particular state indefinitely. It implies a need to change, move forward, or take action. The nuance suggests a sense of urgency or that the current situation is unsustainable. It is a versatile expression, suitable for formal speeches, writing, and everyday conversation, conveying a need to transition from a current state to a different course of action.",
