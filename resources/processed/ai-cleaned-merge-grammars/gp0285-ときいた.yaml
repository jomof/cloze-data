    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the quotative particle 「と」 with 「聞いた」, the past tense of 「聞く」 (kiku), meaning \"to hear.\" This literally forms the phrase \"I heard that.\"",
    "writeup": "「ときいた」 is a versatile expression used to convey information that the speaker has learned from an external source. It implies that the speaker is relaying information they received, rather than stating a personal observation or an undisputed fact. This makes it particularly useful for attributing information or discussing hearsay.\n\nWhile typically used in formal or semi-formal contexts, 「ときいた」 can also appear in casual conversation. A common stylistic feature in informal speech is the omission of the copula 「だ」 (da) when it follows nouns and な-adjectives immediately before 「ときいた」. Although widely accepted and natural-sounding in casual settings, this omission is not considered strictly grammatically correct in more formal writing or speech.",

            "nuance": "「そうだ」 can also mean \"I heard that,\" but it often implies a more direct or immediate source of information, or a general report. 「ときいた」 focuses on the speaker's personal act of hearing."

When choosing among them, consider the speaker's relationship with the listener, the formality of the situation, and the nature of the information's source. 「ときいた」 is generally a safe and neutral option for simply stating information you've heard. For casual conversation, 「んだって」 offers a more colloquial feel, while 「らしい」 and 「そうだ」 imply varying degrees of inference or general reporting. 「だって」 often introduces a reason or counter-argument, making it less suitable for a neutral report of information.",
