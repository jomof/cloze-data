    "etymology": "This grammar point is composed of 「と」, the quotative particle, and 「聞いた」, the past tense of 「聞く」 (kiku), meaning \"to hear.\" Thus, it literally translates to \"I heard that.\"",
    "writeup": "「ときいた」 is used to convey information that the speaker has heard from an external source. It is composed of the quotative particle 「と」 and the past tense form of the verb 「聞く」 (kiku), which means \"to hear.\" Thus, it literally translates to \"I heard that.\" This expression is particularly useful when attributing information to someone else or stating a fact learned through hearsay. It often implies that the speaker is simply relaying information they received, without necessarily endorsing its truth or having direct personal knowledge.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\nIn casual conversation, the copula 「だ」 (da) is often omitted when following nouns and な-adjectives immediately before 「ときいた」. While this omission is common in natural, informal speech, it is technically not considered grammatically correct in formal contexts.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene of \"two friends discussing their living arrangements\" suggests the information is directly shared or relayed, not merely an impression or general knowledge, which `らしい` would imply. The direct hearsay implied by 「ときいた」 fits better with a personal discussion."
