    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ときいた」 is derived from the verb 「聞く (kiku)」, meaning \"to hear\" or \"to listen.\" The particle 「と (to)」 indicates the content that was heard. Thus, 「ときいた」 literally translates to \"I heard that.\"",
    "writeup": "「ときいた」 is used to report information that one has heard. It functions as a set phrase, combining the particle 「と」, which indicates content, with the past tense form of the verb 「聞く」 (to hear). It's crucial to understand that 「ときいた」implies the information comes from an unspecified or general source. You're simply conveying that you received this information, without stating exactly who told you. While omitting 「だ」 after nouns and な-adjectives is common in casual speech, it is not technically correct.",
