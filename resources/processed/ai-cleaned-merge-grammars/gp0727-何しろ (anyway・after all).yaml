etymology: The term 何しろ (nani shiro) is a compound formed from 何 (nani, "what") and しろ (shiro), which
  is the imperative form of する (suru, "to do"). While literally translating to something like "do whatever
  it may be," its meaning has evolved over time to function as an adverb meaning "in any case," "anyway,"
  or "after all." This semantic shift reflects its usage in conveying a sense of inevitability or an undeniable
  foundational truth, regardless of other factors.
writeup: |-
  **何しろ (nani shiro)** is an adverb used to introduce or emphasize a reason, explanation, or circumstance that the speaker considers to be utterly undeniable, obvious, or a fundamental truth. It translates to phrases like "after all," "in any case," "anyway," or "no wonder." Its core function is to present a reason so compelling that the preceding or succeeding statement becomes an an inevitable or logical consequence.

  This expression is highly versatile and can appear at the beginning of a sentence, at the start of a second clause, or sometimes even mid-sentence to strongly connect a statement with its underlying justification. It is very commonly followed by causal conjunctions such as **から (kara)** or **ので (node)**, which further reinforces the explanatory nature of the clause introduced by 何しろ.

  Think of 何しろ as a linguistic tool to highlight the core reason for something, often implying a sense of "it couldn't be any other way because..." or "it's completely understandable given that..." when a justification is being provided. It elevates the subsequent reason to a position of undeniable importance, making the outcome seem a natural and expected result. It is widely used in both casual and more formal conversational contexts.

      relaxation.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The speaker uses casual language with 「ゆっくり する よ」 and the sentence-final particle 「よ」, common
      among friends. 「何しろ」 here emphasizes that his busyness is an undeniable fact, making his desire
      to relax a natural and understandable consequence that the listener should readily accept.
    etymology: 「忙しい」 (isogashii) meaning 'busy' is a common adjective. 「ゆっくり」 (yukkuri) means 'slowly'
      or 'at ease', conveying a sense of relaxation.

    nuance: The use of 「だ から」 (da kara) as a causal conjunction is typical in explanatory contexts. 「何しろ」
      underscores that her genius is an undeniable truth, making her quick problem-solving an obvious
      and expected consequence. The phrase 「どんな 問題 で も」 (donna mondai de mo) means 'any problem whatsoever',
      showing universality.

        english: You see, our budget is limited, so we must prioritize cost-effectiveness.
        hint: 「何しろ」 is suitable for formal explanations emphasizing an undeniable truth. 「なんせ」 is a more
          casual equivalent often used in informal settings or when giving a slightly more personal or
          exasperated reason. We're looking for formal emphasis.

      instead of 「限ら れ て い ます」 (kagirarete imasu) and 「さ せ て いただき ます」 (sasete itadakimasu). 「何しろ」 highlights
      the budget limitation as an irrefutable fact, making the prioritization of cost-effectiveness an
      unavoidable and logical consequence for the team, strengthening the manager''s argument.'

        hint: 「何しろ」 emphasizes the undeniable and foundational reason. 「とにかく」 means 'anyway' or 'in any
          case', often used to summarize or proceed despite minor details, not necessarily to highlight
          the primary cause.

      reason.

      of the rush hour as the fundamental cause of the traffic, presenting it as an undeniable, common-sense
      reason that requires no further explanation.
    etymology: 「渋滞」 (jūtai) meaning 'traffic jam' is a common term. 「ラッシュ アワー」 (rasshu awā) is a loanword
      from English 'rush hour'.
