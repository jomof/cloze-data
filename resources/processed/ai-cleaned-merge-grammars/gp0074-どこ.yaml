        "usage-context": "Used to ask about an unknown location or place. It is a fundamental interrogative pronoun for geographical or positional inquiries.",
        "function": "Interrogative pronoun for location.",
        "nuance": "「どこ」 focuses purely on 'which place,' distinguishing it from 「どっち」 which often implies direction or a choice between two specific options. It asks for a broad or specific location rather than a path or binary choice.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as an interrogative noun that can be the subject, object, or complement in a sentence depending on the particle used with it, such as 「どこに」 (to where), 「どこで」 (at where), or simply 「どこが」 (which place)."
    },
    "etymology": "「どこ」 is derived from the older Japanese word 「いずく」 (izuku), which also meant \"where.\" Over time, 「いずく」 was shortened and evolved into the modern 「どこ」, maintaining its core meaning as an interrogative for location.",
    "writeup": "「どこ」 is a fundamental interrogative pronoun in Japanese used to inquire about a place or location. It directly translates to \"where\" in English and is part of the 「どれ」 family of interrogative words.\n\nWhile 「どこ」 is generally straightforward, it's essential to understand its nuanced usage. It specifically asks about a **place** or **location**. For instance, if you're lost, you would ask 「ここはどこですか？」 (Where is this place?). It can be used with various particles to indicate direction or action at a place, such as 「どこに」 (to where) or 「どこで」 (at where).\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n*   **Distinction from 「どっち」**: 「どこ」 should not be confused with 「どっち」. While both can sometimes be translated as \"where\" in English, 「どこ」 focuses purely on **which place**, while 「どっち」 typically refers to **which direction** (e.g., left or right) or **which one** when choosing between two options. If you're asking someone to point to a specific direction, 「どっち」 is more appropriate. If you're asking for the name or general area of a place, 「どこ」 is correct.\n*   **Versatility**: 「どこ」 can be used in various contexts, from asking for directions to inquiring about the location of an object or even an abstract concept like someone's hometown. It's a versatile word essential for basic communication.",
