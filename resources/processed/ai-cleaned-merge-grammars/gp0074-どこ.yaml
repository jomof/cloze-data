    "etymology": "「どこ」 is derived from the older Japanese word 「いずく」 (izuku), which also meant \"where.\" Over time, 「いずく」 was shortened and evolved into the modern 「どこ」.",
    "writeup": "「どこ」 is used to inquire about a place or location. It directly translates to \"where\" in English.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   「どこ」 should not be confused with 「どっち」. While 「どこ」 focuses purely on **which place**, 「どっち」 typically refers to **which direction** or **which one** when choosing between two options.\n*   This pronoun is fundamental for asking about the location or position of people, objects, or events.",
