        "Usage": "Used in conversation to express a hypothetical or futile situation, often implying that the speaker believes the action is unlikely to succeed or is pointless.",
        "Contraction": "（っ）たって is a contraction of 「と言ったって」or 「としても」"
    },
    "etymology": "（っ）たって derives from the combination of 「と」 (a particle indicating content or condition), 「言った」 (the past tense of 「言う」, meaning \"to say\"), and 「って」 (a colloquial particle emphasizing the preceding word or phrase). The construction implies something is said or assumed to be true, but the speaker doubts its significance or practicality.",
    "writeup": "（っ）たって is a conversational grammar point used to express that even if a certain condition is true, it doesn't change the outcome or the speaker's opinion. It's often used to express a sense of futility or to downplay the significance of a statement. It is a contracted form of 「と言ったって」 or 「としても」. You will often hear it used to express frustration that something won't work, even if it seems like it should. This grammar is informal and typically used in casual conversations.",
