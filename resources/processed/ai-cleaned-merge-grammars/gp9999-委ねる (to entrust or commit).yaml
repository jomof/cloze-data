formation:
  Noun に + Verb[委ねる]: To entrust something to someone or something, or to leave something up to someone
    or something.
  Verb[委ねる] + Noun: To entrust a noun (e.g., responsibility, fate, body, decision).
jlpt: N2
etymology: The verb 「委ねる」 (yudaneru) is thought to derive from earlier forms like 「預ねる」 (azukeneru) or
  「託ねる」 (takuneru), both related to entrusting or depositing. The kanji 「委」 (i) means "committee," "entrust,"
  or "delegate," reinforcing its core meaning. The shift to 「委ねる」 emphasizes the act of "giving over"
  or "leaving to" another's discretion, implying a transfer of authority, responsibility, or destiny.
writeup: 「委ねる」 is a verb meaning "to entrust," "to commit," or "to leave something to someone or something."
  It is primarily used when one gives up control or responsibility over a matter, placing it in the hands
  of another person, an organization, or even fate. The nuance of 「委ねる」 often includes a sense of resignation,
  deep trust, or surrender. It implies a complete reliance or delegation of power and decision-making,
  going beyond a simple act of "giving" (あげる) or "leaving" (残す). This verb is commonly encountered in
  more formal or serious contexts, such as entrusting one's life to fate, delegating a crucial task, or
  committing a decision to a higher authority. It is generally not used for simple, everyday transfers
  of objects.

  - term: 任せる
    meaning: to entrust or leave to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「任せる」 focuses on allowing someone else to handle a task or situation, often implying that
      the task will be carried out and is within the person's ability. It can be used in more casual situations
      and focuses on delegating a task. In contrast, 「委ねる」 implies a more complete relinquishment of control
      or reliance, often in situations where the outcome is uncertain or largely out of one's hands.
    grammar_point: 任せる (to entrust or leave to)
  - term: 預ける
    meaning: to deposit or leave in someone's care
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「預ける」 implies temporarily placing something (or someone) under another's care for safekeeping,
      with an expectation of retrieval or management. It does not carry the same weight of relinquishing
      ultimate control or decision-making as 「委ねる」. Think of it as leaving a bag at a cloakroom.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:預ける (to deposit or leave in care)
  - term: 頼む
    meaning: to request or ask
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「頼む」 is a direct request for action or help. While it involves relying on someone, it does
      not imply giving up control or responsibility over the task itself, but rather seeking assistance
      in its execution. The initiator still maintains oversight.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:頼む (to request)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between 「委ねる」, 「任せる」, 「預ける」, and 「頼む」, consider the degree
  of relinquishment of control and the nature of the task. 「委ねる」 is about surrendering something completely,
  often an outcome or one's fate. 「任せる」 is about delegating a task to someone capable. 「預ける」 is about
  temporary safekeeping. 「頼む」 is simply asking for help or a favor.
examples:
  - english: She entrusted her entire fate to God.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 全て の 運命 を {神 に 委ね た}。
      - 彼女 は 全て の 運命 を {神 に 委ね まし た}。
    english_literally: As for her, all fate, to God, entrusted.

          - 彼女 は 全て の 運命 を 神 に 任せ まし た。
        english: She left all her fate to God.
        hint: While 「任せる」 often implies delegating a task or letting someone handle something, 「委ねる」 carries
          a stronger nuance of surrendering control or committing something completely, especially in
          matters of destiny or responsibility. We're looking for the sense of complete surrender to fate.
    scene: A devout woman is facing an uncertain future and decides to place all her worries in the hands
      of her faith.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: The use of 「神 に 委ねた」 emphasizes a complete surrender of control and deep faith, which is characteristic
      of the verb 「委ねる」 in a solemn context.
  - english: We must entrust the details to the local staff.
    japanese:
      - 細部 は 現地 スタッフ に {委ねる} べき だ。
      - 細部 は 現地 スタッフ に {委ねる} べき です。
      - 細部 は 現地 スタッフ に {委ねる} べき でしょう。

          - 細部 は 現地 スタッフ に 任せる べき です。
        english: We should leave the details to the local staff.
        hint: 「任せる」 is more about delegating a task or responsibility, allowing someone else to handle
          it. 「委ねる」 implies a more complete handover of authority or decision-making. We're looking for
          the sense of handing over all authority.

          - 彼 は 体 を 波 に {任せる} しか なかっ た。
        english: He had no choice but to let his body be handled by the waves.
        hint: While 「任せる」 can imply resignation, 「委ねる」 in this context more strongly emphasizes relinquishing
          control to an external force, almost giving up. We're looking for a situation where he had no
          choice but to completely surrender to the waves.
    scene: A man adrift in the ocean has exhausted all his strength and can no longer fight the currents.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    nuance: The phrase 「委ねざるを得なかった」 uses a compound negative construction expressing inevitability, highlighting
      the lack of choice and complete surrender of the body to an uncontrollable natural force, which
      is a key nuance of 「委ねる」.
  - english: Having entrusted the decision to my subordinates, I will wait for the outcome.
    japanese:
      - 部下 に 判断 を {委ね て}、結果 を 待つ。
      - 部下 に 判断 を {委ね て}、結果 を 待ち ます。

        english: Having left the decision to my subordinates, I will wait for the outcome.
        hint: 「任せる」 here means delegating the decision-making process. While similar, 「委ねる」 carries a
          nuance of a more complete transfer of responsibility, implying the speaker is stepping back
          from the decision entirely. We're looking for that sense of full entrustment.

          - この 問題 の 解決 は 交渉 の 過程 に 任さ れ て い ます。
        english: The resolution of this issue is left to the negotiation process.
        hint: 「任されている」 suggests that the negotiation process has been assigned or given the task to resolve
          the issue. 「委ねられている」 implies that the ultimate decision or outcome is being surrendered to the
          negotiation process, highlighting a deeper level of reliance on its findings. We're looking
          for the phrase that emphasizes reliance on the outcome.

        english: You can leave your child's education to this reputable school.
        hint: While 「任せる」 can be used for entrusting, 「委ねる」 carries a nuance of completely handing over,
          implying a deep trust in the school's ability to shape the child's future. We're looking for
          the sense of complete faith and handover.

          - 全て を 時 の 流れ に 任せ ましょう。
        english: Let's leave everything to the flow of time.
        hint: 「任せる」 would imply simply letting things take their course. 「委ねる」 suggests a more active,
          though perhaps resigned, act of surrendering control to an abstract concept like the flow of
          time. We're looking for the sense of active surrender.
    scene: Two old friends are discussing life's uncertainties over tea, deciding to let things unfold
      naturally.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: volitional (～よう)

      decision to yield to natural processes, characteristic of an intimate conversation.

        english: If you leave the work to him, it will surely be completed successfully.
        hint: 「任せる」 focuses on delegating a task to someone's competence. 「委ねる」 implies a more significant
          act of committing the work and its outcome entirely to that person, relying fully on their judgment.
          We're looking for a strong sense of reliance.
    scene: A team leader is discussing delegating a difficult project and is confident in a specific team
      member's ability.

          - 彼 は 全 財産 を 娘 に 渡す こと に し た。
          - 彼 は 全 財産 を 娘 に 渡す こと に し まし た。
        english: He decided to hand over his life savings to his daughter.
        hint: 「渡す」 means to simply hand over or pass something. It lacks the nuance of placing trust and
          responsibility for something, which is central to 「委ねる」. We're looking for the act of entrusting,
          not just transferring.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 全 財産 を 娘 に 任せる こと に し た。
          - 彼 は 全 財産 を 娘 に 任せる こと に し まし た。
        english: He decided to leave his life savings to his daughter's management.
        hint: 「任せる」 implies giving someone the responsibility to manage something. 「委ねる」 goes further,
          suggesting a more complete surrender of control, often with a sense of destiny or major life
          decision. We're looking for the sense of complete entrustment of future responsibility.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 全 財産 を 娘 に 預ける こと に し た。
          - 彼 は 全 財産 を 娘 に 預ける こと に し まし た。
        english: He decided to deposit his life savings with his daughter.
        hint: 「預ける」 means to deposit or leave something in someone's care, often temporarily, like a bank.
          It doesn't imply the same level of transfer of ownership or deep trust for the future as 「委ねる」.
          We're looking for the phrase that means to fully entrust, not just temporarily deposit.
    scene: An elderly man prepares his will, making arrangements for his inheritance.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「委ねる」 for transferring "全財産" (all assets) to a daughter implies not just giving
      money but entrusting her with the responsibility and future management of it. This highlights the
      verb's nuance of significant delegation and trust.
  - english: He can no longer entrust his future to others.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は もう 自分 の 未来 を 他人 に {委ね られ ない}。
      - 彼 は もう 自分 の 未来 を 他人 に {委ね られ ませ ん}。
    english_literally: He, as for, no longer, his own future, to others, cannot entrust.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は もう 自分 の 未来 を 他人 に 任せ られ ない。
          - 彼 は もう 自分 の 未来 を 他人 に 任せ られ ませ ん。
        english: He can no longer leave his future to others' discretion.
        hint: 「任せる」 emphasizes the delegation of decision-making. 「委ねる」 carries a stronger meaning of
          surrendering one's future or destiny completely. We're looking for the sense of inability to
          surrender control over one's own future.
    scene: A young man, having faced past disappointments, resolves to take full control of his own life.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: potential (～られる/～える)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The negative potential form 「委ねられない」 signifies an inability or unwillingness to surrender
      control, reflecting a personal decision to take agency over one's life. The direct object 「自分の未来」
      (one's own future) and indirect object 「他人」 (others) clearly show the core usage of 「委ねる」.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 「委ねる」 is typically used when a significant degree of control,
  responsibility, or destiny is handed over to another party or an abstract concept like 'fate' or 'the
  flow of time'. It's important to recognize that this is a more profound act than simply delegating a
  task or temporarily lending an item.
