    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に即して」 is derived from 「即する (sokushiru)」, which means \"to conform to,\" \"to be based on,\" or \"to be in accordance with.\" The 「に」 indicates the basis or standard to which something conforms, and 「して」 is the te-form of 「する」, functioning here to connect to a following action or state.",
    "writeup": "「に即して」 is a formal grammar structure indicating that something is done in accordance with a certain standard, situation, or set of rules. It implies aligning actions or decisions with a particular basis to achieve the best possible outcome. It is a combination of 「に」 and the verb 「即する」 in its te-form. While 「に則して」 is similar, 「に即して」 is often preferred because it is more broadly applicable. 「に則して」 tends to be used when referring to laws, policies, or standards.",
