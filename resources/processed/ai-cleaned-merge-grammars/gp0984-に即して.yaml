        "nuance": "Emphasizes practical alignment with existing conditions rather than theoretical principles. Often implies doing what is appropriate for the given circumstances.",
        "counterpoint": "Often confused with に則して (ni norishite), which specifically refers to strict adherence to laws, rules, or established norms.

    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に即して」 is derived from 「即する (sokushiru)」, which means \"to conform to,\" \"to be based on,\" or \"to be in accordance with.\" The 「に」 indicates the basis or standard to which something conforms, and 「して」 is the te-form of 「する」, functioning here to connect to a following action or state.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「に即して」 is a formal expression used to indicate that an action or decision is made **in accordance with**, **based on**, or **in line with** a particular standard, situation, or set of facts. It emphasizes a practical alignment, ensuring that what is being done is appropriate for the existing circumstances. This structure is formed by combining the particle 「に」 with the te-form of the verb 「即する」, which means 'to conform to' or 'to be based on'. When used to modify a noun, the form changes to 「に即した」, acting as an attributive adjective, for example, 「現実に即した計画」 (a plan in line with reality).\n\nWhile 「に即して」 can be broadly applied to various situations, it is often contrasted with 「に則して」 (ni norishite), which carries a stricter nuance of adhering to established rules, laws, or norms. Although there's an overlap, 「に即して」 is generally preferred when referring to adapting to real-world conditions or facts, whereas 「に則して」 is more fitting for strict compliance with formal codes. This distinction is subtle but important in formal and technical contexts.",
