    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に即して」 is derived from 「即する (sokusuru)」, a する verb meaning \"to conform to,\" \"to be based on,\" or \"to comply with.\" The 「て」 form connects it to the preceding noun with 「に」, indicating the basis or standard for compliance. Thus, 「に即して」 means \"in accordance with\" or \"based on\" something.",
    "writeup": "「に即して」 is a formal grammar structure indicating that something is done to handle a matter in the best possible way. It combines 「に」 with the te-form of the する-verb 「即する (sokusuru)」, which means \"to conform to,\" \"to be based on,\" or \"to comply with.\" It's often used before nouns or when one noun directly modifies another, in which case 「に即した」 is used instead of 「に即して」.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「に即して」 is used when actions are based on circumstances or situations.\n*   「に則して (ni norishite)」, which also means \"in accordance with,\" tends to be used when something is done in accordance with laws, policies, or standards. However, there are situations where 「に則して」 is incorrect, so 「に即して」 is often used in both cases in recent years.",
