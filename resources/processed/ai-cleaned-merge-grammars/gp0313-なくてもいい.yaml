    "etymology": "The grammar point 「なくてもいい」 is formed by combining the negative form of a verb 「ない」, the 「～てもいい」 construction indicating permission, and the particle 「も」, which adds emphasis to the allowance of not doing something.",
    "writeup": "「なくてもいい」 indicates that something is not necessary or permitted. It's the opposite of 「てもいい」. It suggests it's \"ok even if (A) is not done.\" It often comes across as polite, like saying, \"don't worry about doing (A).\" In casual speech, the particle 「も」 can be dropped to sound more friendly.",
