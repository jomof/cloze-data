    "etymology": "The grammar point 「なくてもいい」 is formed by combining the negative form of a verb 「ない」, the 「～てもいい」 construction indicating permission, and the particle 「も」, which adds emphasis to the allowance of not doing something.",
    "writeup": "「なくてもいい」 expresses that an action is not necessary or that it is permissible not to do something. It is essentially the negative counterpart of 「てもいい」, which means \"may do\" or \"it's okay to do\". This construction highlights that \"it is acceptable even if (A) is not performed\".\n\nWhen used, 「なくてもいい」 often conveys a polite and considerate tone, akin to saying \"you don't have to worry about doing (A)\" in English. It is composed of a verb in its negative ない form, followed by the conjunctive particle 「て」, then the auxiliary adjective 「いい」. The particle 「も」 emphasizes the inclusivity of the non-action being acceptable.\n\nIn casual conversation, the particle 「も」 can be omitted, resulting in 「なくていい」. This does not alter the core meaning but makes the expression sound more relaxed and friendly, particularly when speaking with close acquaintances or family.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While these expressions may appear similar, it's crucial to grasp that 「なくてもいい」 focuses on the permission or allowance of *not* doing something. In contrast, 「なくてはいけない」 expresses obligation, and 「てはいけない」 / 「てはならない」 denote prohibition. 「ことはない」 is similar in meaning to 「なくてもいい」 but emphasizes the absence of necessity more definitively. Pay close attention to the context and nuance to select the appropriate expression.",
