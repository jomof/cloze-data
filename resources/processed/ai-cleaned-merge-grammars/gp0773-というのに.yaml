    "etymology": "「というのに」 is derived from 「と言う」 (to say) + 「のに」 (even though). The combination creates a sense of something being stated or understood, yet the reality is contrary to that understanding.",
    "writeup": "「というのに」 is a conjunction used to express that something is happening contrary to one's expectations. It often carries a nuance of disappointment, surprise, or disapproval. It connects two clauses, where the first clause sets up an expectation, and the second clause describes a situation that contradicts that expectation. It's similar to 「のに」, but 「というのに」 often emphasizes the unexpectedness or inappropriateness of the situation more strongly.",
