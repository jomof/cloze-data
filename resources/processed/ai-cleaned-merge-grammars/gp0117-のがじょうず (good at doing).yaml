formation:

    the verb.
  '[Noun] が + じょうず': Indicates skill or proficiency in a general area (e.g., a subject or sport).
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: adjective
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: general
  function: describes skill or proficiency
  nuance: Can sound boastful if used about oneself; 得意 is often preferred for personal skills.
  grammatical-role: nominalization
  logical-flow: states a fact of skill
  temporal-flow: typically present or past tense, but verb before の remains dictionary form
  spatial-flow: n/a
etymology: The grammar point のがじょうず combines the nominalizer の (no), which transforms a verb phrase into
  a noun phrase, with the subject particle が (ga), and the adjectival noun じょうず (jōzu), meaning 'skillful'
  or 'good at'. Therefore, it literally translates to 'the act of [verb] is skillful'. This structure
  is common in Japanese to describe an action as a subject of a statement. The use with a direct noun
  (Noun が じょうず) is also common, indicating proficiency in a subject or skill directly.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「〜のがじょうず」 is used to express that someone is skilled or proficient at performing a particular action. It functions very similarly to 「〜のが好き」 (no ga suki, to like doing something), but instead of conveying a preference, it describes an ability or level of skill. The structure effectively nominalizes the preceding verb phrase, making it the subject of the adjectival noun 「じょうず」.

  The verb that precedes 「のが」 must always be in its plain, dictionary form, regardless of whether it's an Ichidan verb, a Godan verb, or an irregular verb. The particle 「が」 is always used in this construction because 「じょうず」 is an adjectival noun, and adjectival nouns require 「が」 to mark their subject when used with a nominalized phrase. The construction 「のは」 cannot be used with 「じょうず」.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *   When expressing that someone *was* good at something in the past, the verb itself remains in the plain form. Only 「じょうず」 is conjugated to its past tense form (e.g., 「じょうずだった」 or 「じょうずでした」).

  *   It is important to note that directly stating 「私が〜のがじょうずです」 (Watashi ga ~ no ga jōzu desu, "I am good at doing ~") can sometimes sound boastful or arrogant, especially in more formal contexts or when referring to one's own general abilities. To express personal proficiency in a more humble or confident, yet not conceited, manner, the word 「得意 (とくい)」 (tokui) is often preferred. For example, 「歌うのが得意です」 (Utau no ga tokui desu, "Singing is my strong point" or "I am confident in my singing ability") is a common and humble alternative when talking about your own skills.
false_friends:
  - term: のが好き
    meaning: To like doing, to love doing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「のがじょうず」 which describes skill, 「のが好き」 expresses enjoyment or preference for an activity.
    grammar_point: の が 好き (like doing)
  - term: のがへた
    meaning: To be bad at, poor at, unskillful
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「のがへた」 is the direct opposite of 「のがじょうず」, indicating a lack of skill or proficiency in an
      activity.
    grammar_point: のが下手 (to be unskillful at)
  - term: 得意
    meaning: To be good at (one's strong point), to be confident in
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「得意」 also means 'to be good at', it specifically refers to something being one's strong
      point or something they are confident in. It is often preferred when speaking humbly about one's
      own skills, unlike 「じょうず」 which can sound boastful if applied to oneself.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:得意 (to be good at・one's strong point)
  - term: Noun が 上手
    meaning: To be good at (a subject or skill)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This construction describes general proficiency in a subject or skill (e.g., 'good at English',
      'good at cooking'), rather than specifically the *act* of doing something (e.g., 'good at speaking
      English', 'good at cooking'). The のが in 『のがじょうず』 emphasizes the *action* of the verb.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Noun が 上手 (good at a skill・subject)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「のが好き」, 「のがじょうず」, and 「のがへた」 all share the 「のが」 nominalization structure,
  they convey distinct meanings regarding one's relationship with an activity. 「のが好き」 indicates enjoyment,
  「のがじょうず」 denotes proficiency, and 「のがへた」 signifies lack of skill. Furthermore, while 「得意」 can also mean
  'good at', it carries a nuance of personal strength or confidence, making it a more appropriate choice
  when discussing one's own abilities to avoid sounding boastful with 「じょうず」. Finally, 『Noun が 上手』 describes
  general proficiency in a subject or skill, whereas 『Verb + のが + じょうず』 specifically refers to proficiency
  in the *act* of performing a verb.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 山田 先生 は 英語 を 話す の が へた です。
        english: Professor Yamada is bad at speaking English.

        english: Professor Yamada is confident in speaking English.
        hint: While '得意' is similar, 'じょうず' describes general skill, whereas '得意' implies a strong point
          or personal confidence. We're looking for a general statement about their proficiency.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 山田 先生 は 英語 が 上手 です。

          it. We're looking for proficiency in the action.
        hint: This refers to general proficiency in English, not specifically the *act* of speaking it.

        english: Drawing was my strong point, you know.
        hint: While '得意' is similar, 'じょうず' is generally used for others or in a less self-boastful way
          in this context. We're looking for a general past ability.

    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 'The particle 「よ」 adds a sense of informing or reassurance, typical in casual conversation
      between close friends, especially when a female speaker uses it. The phrase refers to a past general
      ability using 『のがじょうず』. However, for a more direct past statement, `だった` is perfectly fine in casual
      settings between close friends without any additional particles, as seen in the example: 『子供 の 時、絵
      を 描く の が じょうず だっ た』 (When I was a child, I was good at drawing).'

        english: She doesn't like singing.

          at', not 'doesn't like'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 歌う の が へた です。
        english: She is bad at singing.
        hint: The original statement uses a polite way of saying 'not good at'. While 'へた' means 'bad
          at', 'じょうずではありません' is often chosen for a softer, more indirect assessment.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 歌う の は 彼女 の 得意 で は あり ませ ん。
        english: Singing is not her strong point.

    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male

    nuance: The casual `だった` without a sentence-final particle indicates a simple statement of past fact
      among male friends in an informal setting. This usage is common and natural in close male conversations
      to convey information directly and concisely, without needing to soften the statement with additional
      particles like 『よ』 or 『ね』, which might add a sense of seeking agreement or informing in a more feminine
      way. It is a direct and factual recollection of his younger brother's past skill.

        hint: While '得意' is similar, 'じょうず' here describes a general observable skill.
    scene: A grandchild proudly talking about their grandmother's hobby.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: 「じょうず」 is appropriately used here when speaking about someone else's skill. The use of 「祖母」
      (grandmother) naturally suggests a respectful context without requiring honorific verbs, and the
      polite form 「です」 maintains general politeness.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 「〜のがじょうず」 is a versatile expression to describe
  someone's proficiency in an activity. Remember to use the plain form of the verb before 「のが」, and conjugate
  「じょうず」 itself to reflect tense or politeness.
