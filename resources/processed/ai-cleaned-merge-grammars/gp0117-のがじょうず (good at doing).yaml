    "etymology": "The grammar point のがじょうず combines the nominalizer の (no), which transforms a verb phrase into a noun phrase, with the subject particle が (ga), and the adjectival noun じょうず (jōzu), meaning 'skillful' or 'good at'. Therefore, it literally translates to 'the act of [verb] is skillful'. This structure is common in Japanese to describe an action as a subject of a statement.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「〜のがじょうず」 is used to express that someone is skilled or proficient at performing a particular action. It functions very similarly to 「〜のが好き」 (no ga suki, to like doing something), but instead of conveying a preference, it describes an ability or level of skill. The structure effectively nominalizes the preceding verb phrase, making it the subject of the adjectival noun 「じょうず」.\n\nThe verb that precedes 「のが」 must always be in its plain, dictionary form, regardless of whether it's an Ichidan verb, a Godan verb, or an irregular verb. The particle 「が」 is always used in this construction because 「じょうず」 is an adjectival noun, and adjectival nouns require 「が」 to mark their subject when used with a nominalized phrase. The construction 「のは」 cannot be used with 「じょうず」.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   When expressing that someone *was* good at something in the past, the verb itself remains in the plain form. Only 「じょうず」 is conjugated to its past tense form (e.g., 「じょうずだった」 or 「じょうずでした」).\n\n*   It is important to note that directly stating 「私が〜のがじょうずです」 (Watashi ga ~ no ga jōzu desu, \"I am good at doing ~\") can sometimes sound boastful or arrogant, especially in more formal contexts or when referring to one's own general abilities. To express personal proficiency in a more humble or confident, yet not conceited, manner, the word 「得意 (とくい)」 (tokui) is often preferred. For example, 「歌うのが得意です」 (Utau no ga tokui desu, \"Singing is my strong point\" or \"I am confident in my singing ability\") is a common and humble alternative when talking about your own skills.",

Furthermore, while 「得意」 can also mean 'good at', it carries a nuance of personal strength or confidence, making it a more appropriate choice when discussing one's own abilities to avoid sounding boastful with 「じょうず」.",
