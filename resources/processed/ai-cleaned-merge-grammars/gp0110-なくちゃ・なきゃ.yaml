    "etymology": "「なくちゃ」 is a contraction of 「なくては」, and 「なきゃ」 is a contraction of 「なければ」. Both 「～なくては」 and 「～なければ」 mean \"must do\" or \"have to do\". The abbreviations add a more casual tone.",
    "writeup": "「なくちゃ」 (short for 「なくては」) and 「なきゃ」 (short for 「なければ」) are common colloquial abbreviations to convey that something \"must\" or \"has to\" be done. Like 「てはいけない」 (must not), 「なくてはいけない」 (must), and 「なくてはならない」 (must), these abbreviated forms can be followed by 「いけない」, 「ならない」, or 「だめ」; however, they are usually omitted without changing the meaning.\n\nThese casual variations are similar to \"gotta\" in English. There is no single \"most natural\" form; speaker preference often dictates the choice.\n\nThe shortest variations (excluding 「いけない」, etc.) are the most casual. Other variations exist based on region or speaker. An example is 「なけりゃ」, a *very* casual form of 「なければ」, generally used by male speakers and considered rougher than 「なきゃ」 or 「なくちゃ」, which anyone can use.",
