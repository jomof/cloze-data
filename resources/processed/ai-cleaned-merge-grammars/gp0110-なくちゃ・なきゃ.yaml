    "etymology": "Both 「なくちゃ」 and 「なきゃ」 are shortened forms of 「なくては」 and 「なければ」 respectively, which are themselves derived from the conditional form of the negative auxiliary verb 「ない」 combined with 「は」. They evolved to express obligation or necessity in more colloquial speech.",
    "writeup": "「なくちゃ」 (short for 「なくては」) and 「なきゃ」 (short for 「なければ」) are common colloquial abbreviations to convey that something \"must\" or \"has to\" be done. They are like saying \"gotta\" in English. They both indicate a sense of obligation or necessity, but are primarily used in **casual** speech. Often, the implied consequence (like 「いけない」, 「ならない」, or 「だめ」) is omitted, which makes the expression even more informal. The choice between 「なくちゃ」 and 「なきゃ」 often comes down to speaker preference. \n\nThere are regional variations such as 「なけりゃ」, which is a *very* casual form of 「なければ」. While anyone *can* use them, some of these less common variations are typically used by certain genders (in general). 「なけりゃ」 tends to be used by male speakers and is considered a bit rougher than 「なきゃ」 or 「なくちゃ」.",
