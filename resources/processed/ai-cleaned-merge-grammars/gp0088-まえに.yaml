    "writeup": "**前に (mae ni)** indicates something happening 'before' another event or being 'in front of' a location. It functions as a preposition or conjunction. When used with verbs, they must be in their dictionary form. When used with nouns indicating location or time, の is required. Unlike **手前に (temae ni)**, **前に** can describe something in front of any location. **手前に** is more specifically for things directly in front of you.",
    "etymology": "The word 前 (mae) means 'front' or 'before'. The に (ni) particle indicates location or time, so 前に literally means 'at the front' or 'at the time before'.",
