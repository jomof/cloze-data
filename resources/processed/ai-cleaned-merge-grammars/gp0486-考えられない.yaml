    "etymology": "考えられない is the potential negative form of the verb 考える (kangaeru), meaning \"to think\" or \"to consider.\" The potential form 考えられる (kangaerareru) means \"can think\" or \"is conceivable.\" By adding the negative ない (nai), it becomes 考えられない (kangaerarenai), meaning \"cannot think\" or \"is inconceivable.\"",
    "writeup": "**考えられない** is the negative potential form of the verb **考える** ('kangaeru', to consider). It is often used with adverbs like **など** (nado, like, such as) or expressions that nominalize a phrase, such as **ということは** (to iu koto wa, the fact that). **考えられない** is generally translated as \"(A) is unimaginable\" or \"(A) is unthinkable,\" which is close to its literal meaning. This grammar point implies an inability to conceive of something due to its unbelievability or impossibility.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\n\n*   While **考えられない** refers to the inability to think of something, **考えない** (kangaenai, to not consider) or **考えていない** (kangaeteinai, to not be considering) express a conscious decision or current state of not thinking about something. Because of this, only **考えられない** is appropriate to imply something is unbelievable.",
