    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てはいけない」 is derived from the te-form of a verb, followed by the particle 「は」, and the negative potential form of 「行く (いく)」, which is 「いけない」. Literally, it suggests that doing something is 'not allowed to go' or 'cannot proceed'.",
    "writeup": "「Verb[て]+はいけない」 expresses a strong prohibition, meaning that something 'must not', 'may not', or 'cannot' be done. It is considered a more formal expression. While 「は」 is generally not dropped, the phrase 「ては」 is often shortened to 「ちゃ」 (for 「ては」) or 「じゃ」 (for 「では」) to make it more casual.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   「いけない」 is fairly neutral and can be used in both spoken and written language.\n*   「ならない」 is more formal and mostly used in written language.\n*   「だめ」 is very casual and almost exclusively used in spoken language.",
