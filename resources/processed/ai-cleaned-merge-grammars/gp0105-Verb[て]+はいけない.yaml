    "etymology": "This grammar point comes from the て-form of a verb combined with the particle 「は」and the negative potential form of 「行く」 (iku), meaning 'to go'. Literally, it means 'it is not allowed to go' or 'it is not acceptable'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[て]+はいけない」 is used to express a strong prohibition, indicating that something **must not** or **cannot** be done. While 「は」 is often omitted in other grammatical structures, it's generally retained here to avoid misinterpretation of 「いけない」 as a subsequent action. In casual speech, 「ては」 often contracts to 「ちゃ」, and 「では」 to 「じゃ」, simplifying the phrase. While 「いけない」 is fairly neutral and common in both speech and writing, 「ならない」 carries a more formal tone, mainly used in written language. 「だめ」 is very casual, almost exclusively used in spoken language.",
