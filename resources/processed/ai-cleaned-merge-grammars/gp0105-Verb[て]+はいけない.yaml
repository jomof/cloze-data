        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "Used in both spoken and written language for general prohibitions or rules.",
        "function": "To express strong prohibition or unacceptability of an action.",
        "nuance": "While the particle 「は」 can often be omitted in other grammatical structures, it is generally retained in this grammar point to clearly distinguish 「いけない」 as a prohibitive auxiliary verb rather than a subsequent action in a sequence. In casual speech, 「ては」 can contract to 「ちゃ」, and 「では」 can contract to 「じゃ」 for easier pronunciation."
    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point comes from the て-form of a verb combined with the particle 「は」 and the negative potential form of 「行く」 (iku), meaning 'to go'. Literally, it means 'it is not allowed to go' or 'it is not acceptable'. Over time, its meaning evolved from a literal inability to 'go through' with an action to a general prohibition.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[て]+はいけない」 is used to express a strong prohibition, indicating that something **must not** or **cannot** be done. While 「は」 is often omitted in other grammatical structures, it's generally retained here to avoid misinterpretation of 「いけない」 as a subsequent action. In casual speech, 「ては」 often contracts to 「ちゃ」, and 「では」 to 「じゃ」, simplifying the phrase. While 「いけない」 is fairly neutral and common in both speech and writing, 「ならない」 carries a more formal tone, mainly used in written language. 「だめ」 is very casual, almost exclusively used in spoken language.",
