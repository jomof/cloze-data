        "nuance": "While the particle 「は」 can often be omitted in other grammatical structures, it's generally retained in this grammar point to avoid misinterpretation of 「いけない」 as a subsequent action. In casual speech, 「ては」 often contracts to 「ちゃ」, and 「では」 can contract to 「じゃ」, simplifying the phrase."
    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point comes from the て-form of a verb combined with the particle 「は」 and the negative potential form of 「行く」 (iku), meaning 'to go'. Literally, it means 'it is not allowed to go' or 'it is not acceptable'. Over time, its meaning evolved from a literal inability to 'go through' with an action to a general prohibition.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[て]+はいけない」 expresses a strong prohibition, indicating that an action **must not** or **cannot** be performed. While the literal meaning comes from the て-form of a verb combined with the particle 「は」 and the negative potential form of 「行く」 (to go), signifying \"it is not allowed to go\" or \"it is not acceptable,\" its usage has evolved to a general prohibition. The particle 「は」 is generally retained in this structure to prevent misinterpretation of 「いけない」 as a sequential action. In casual conversation, 「ては」 often contracts to 「ちゃ」, and 「では」 to 「じゃ」, making the phrase easier to pronounce. It is common for the second-person subject to be omitted when using this phrase. While 「いけない」 is a versatile form used in both spoken and written Japanese, 「ならない」 conveys a more formal tone, primarily found in written contexts. In contrast, 「だめ」 is highly casual and almost exclusively used in spoken language.",
