  part-of-speech: particle
  particle-syntactic-function: adverbializer
  particle-pragmatic-function: limiting
  usage-context: Primarily used when discussing prices, costs, rates, or quantities associated with a
    unit of measure or time.
  function: Indicates a rate or cost for a specific unit or quantity.
  nuance: Specifies the rate or amount per unit, quantity, or group, emphasizing the individual allocation
    within a collective or measurement.
  colocation: Often found with numbers, counters, and units of time or quantity.
  grammatical-role: Functions adverbially, modifying verbs or adjectives by specifying a rate or condition.
  temporal-flow: Can indicate a duration or frequency within a certain timeframe.
  spatial-flow: Less directly related to spatial flow, but can imply a rate over a distance (e.g., kilometers
    per liter). It signifies a boundary or unit within which something occurs or is priced.
etymology: The particle で originally indicates the location where an action takes place or the means by
  which something is done. In this context, it has evolved to express a ratio or rate, specifying the
  cost or quantity associated with something.
writeup: The particle **で** in this usage precisely indicates a rate or price for a specific quantity
  or unit, essentially conveying 'per' or 'for each'. It is frequently employed when discussing financial
  transactions, such as costs, prices, or rates. This usage specifies the exact amount or cost associated
  with a fundamental unit or quantity. While its primary application is in expressing pricing and rates,
  **で** can also convey a quantity achieved within a defined scope, such as the amount of work completed
  within a certain timeframe. Its versatility allows it to be used across various registers, from formal
  business contexts to casual everyday conversations, depending on the broader sentence structure and
  vocabulary.

  - term: に
    meaning: per; in
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While に can also indicate a rate (e.g., 一日に二回 - twice a day), で is specifically used to indicate
      a cost or amount associated with a unit or quantity, making it more direct in pricing and efficiency
      contexts. に often implies a broader relationship or proportion.
    grammar_point: に (frequency)
  - term: につき
    meaning: per; for each
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: につき is more formal and used in official or written contexts, such as regulations or official
      notices. で is more versatile and commonly used in everyday spoken Japanese for pricing and rates.
    grammar_point: につき (due to or per)
post_false_friends_writeup: Both に and につき can express rates, but で is more specific to indicating a rate
  or amount associated with a unit or quantity. につき is much more formal, while で is widely used in both
  casual and polite spoken Japanese. Paying attention to the context and formality will help you choose
  the most appropriate particle.
