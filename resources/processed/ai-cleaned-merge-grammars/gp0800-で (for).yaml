    "writeup": "The particle **で** in this usage precisely indicates a rate or price for a specific quantity or unit, essentially conveying 'per' or 'for each'. It is frequently employed when discussing financial transactions, such as costs, prices, or rates. This usage specifies the exact amount or cost associated with a fundamental unit or quantity. While its primary application is in expressing pricing and rates, **で** can also convey a quantity achieved within a defined scope, such as the amount of work completed within a certain timeframe. Its versatility allows it to be used across various registers, from formal business contexts to casual everyday conversations, depending on the broader sentence structure and vocabulary.",
