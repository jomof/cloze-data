    "etymology": "This grammar point stems from the formal copula 「である」. 「であれ」 is derived from the imperative form of 「ある」 (the verb component of 「である」). When used in the 「〜であれ〜であれ」 structure, it emphasizes that the result or conclusion remains unchanged, irrespective of the options presented.",
    "writeup": "The construction 「であれ〜であれ」 (and its alternative 「であろうと〜であろうと」) is a formal expression used to state that a certain outcome or truth holds true irrespective of which of two or more presented options is the case. It is akin to saying \"whether... or...\" or \"no matter if...\" in English, emphasizing that the result remains unchanged under different conditions.\n\nThis pattern is derived from the formal copula 「である」, with 「であれ」 being the imperative form of 「ある」 (the verb component of 「である」). 「であろうと」 combines the volitional form of 「ある」 with the particle 「と」. Both forms attach primarily to nouns or nominalized phrases.\n\nA key characteristic of this structure is that the options presented (A, B, etc.) typically belong to the same category or share a common logical link, as the consequence must be applicable to all. For instance, if discussing vehicles, one might say 'whether it's a plane or a submarine, they are both modes of transport.'\n\nWhile 「であれ」 can also be used alone to mean 'even if' or 'no matter,' its consecutive use 「AであれBであれ」 specifically highlights the irrelevance of the distinction between A and B concerning the stated outcome. It often conveys a sense of strong conviction or a universal truth.",
