    "etymology": "The expression 「わけにはいかない」 combines 「わけ」 (wake), meaning 'reason' or 'cause,' with the particle 「に」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and 「いかない」 (ikanai), the negative form of 「行く」 (iku), meaning 'to go.' Thus, it literally translates to 'it cannot go that way,' implying that there is a reason or circumstance preventing a certain action.",
    "writeup": "「わけにはいかない」 indicates that one is unable to do something due to external circumstances, social norms, or personal obligations. It conveys a strong sense of obligation or necessity, suggesting that there is **\"no way\"** to avoid a particular action or that one **\"cannot afford\"** to do something else. This expression highlights that the speaker feels compelled to avoid a certain action because it would be inappropriate, undesirable, or impossible given their situation or external factors. It is commonly used in both formal and informal contexts, depending on the verb it modifies and the sentence ending. The emphasis is on the **reason** (わけ) why a certain action (or non-action) is prohibited or impossible.",
