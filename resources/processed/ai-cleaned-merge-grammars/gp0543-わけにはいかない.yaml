    "etymology": "The expression 「わけにはいかない」combines 「わけ」 (wake), meaning 'reason' or 'cause,' with the particle 「に」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and 「いかない」 (ikanai), the negative form of 「行く」 (iku), meaning 'to go.' Thus, it literally translates to 'it cannot go that way,' implying that there is a reason or circumstance preventing a certain action.",
    "writeup": "「わけにはいかない」 indicates that one is unable to do something due to external circumstances, social norms, or personal obligations. It conveys a sense of obligation or necessity, suggesting that there is \"no way\" to avoid a particular action or that one \"cannot afford\" to do something else. The nuance is similar to \"cannot help but\" or \"have no choice but to.\"",
