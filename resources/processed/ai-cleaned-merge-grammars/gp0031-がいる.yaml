    "etymology": "The grammar point がいる is a combination of the particle が, which marks the subject, and the verb いる, meaning \"to exist\" (for animate objects).",
    "writeup": "「がいる」 is a common Japanese construction that is a simple combination of the particle 「が」 and the verb 「いる」. This expression means \"to exist\" or \"there is,\" and is used exclusively in relation to living or animate things (people, animals, etc.). This contrasts with 「がある」, which is used for non-living or inanimate objects and abstract concepts.\n\nSince the things being described in these examples are considered to be alive (or operated by something that is alive), 「いる」 is the verb that must be used. For inanimate objects, 「ある」 is used instead.\n\nThe polite form of 「いる」 conjugates as 「います」. Due to the 「る」 being removed, 「いる」 is classified as a る-Verb (Ichidan verb).\n\nThe kanji form **居る** is quite common and should be learned early to avoid reading confusion. There is no nuance difference between this expression being used with or without kanji; it is merely a matter of writer preference.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\nWhile grammatically essential, the particle 「が」 in 「がいる」 is often omitted in casual speech or in writing that emulates casual speech, such as manga dialogue or instant messaging. This omission is a characteristic of natural, informal Japanese.",

Furthermore, while 住む (to live/reside) indicates presence, it implies a more permanent dwelling than simply being present, which is what がいる conveys. 存在する (to exist) is a very formal term for existence, applicable to a much broader range of things, unlike がいる which is limited to animate entities in conversational settings.",
