    "etymology": "The grammar point 「がいる」 is a combination of the particle 「が」, which marks the subject, and the verb 「いる」, meaning \"to exist\" (for animate objects).",
    "writeup": "「がいる」 is a common construction that combines the 「が」 particle and the verb 「いる」. It means \"to exist\" or \"there is\" and is used for living or animate things.\n\nBecause the things described are considered alive (or operated by something alive), 「いる」 is used. 「ある」 is for non-living things.\n\nThe polite form of 「いる」 is 「います」. Because the 「る」 is dropped in the polite form, we know 「いる」 is a る-verb (Ichidan verb).\n\nThe kanji form 「居る」 is common and should be learned early to avoid reading confusion. There's no nuance difference between using it with or without kanji; it's up to the writer's preference.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   The 「が」 in 「がいる」 is often omitted in casual speech or writing (manga, instant messaging, etc.).",
