    "writeup": "がいる is a common construction that is simply a combination of the が particle, and the verb いる. This expression means 'to exist' or 'there is,' and is used in relation to living or animate things. Because the things being described in these examples are considered to be alive (or operated by something that is alive), いる is the verb that will be used. ある is used for non-living things.\n\nThe polite form of いる conjugates as います. Due to the る being removed, いる is classified as a る-Verb (Ichidan verb).\n\nThe kanji form **居る** is common and should be learned early to avoid reading confusion. There is no nuance difference between this expression being used with or without kanji, and it is up to the preference of the writer.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\nThe が in がいる is often omitted in casual speech or writing that behaves like casual speech (e.g., manga, instant messaging).",
