        "Register": "Varies depending on the context. Can be used in formal and informal settings.",
        "Function": "Indicates exclusion or addition, depending on the context.  Similar to 「〜のほかに」 or 「〜を除いて」. Can also indicate that there is nothing else one can do.",
        "Usage": "Can be used with nouns, verbs, or adjectives. When used with verbs or adjectives, they should be in their dictionary form."
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「以外」 is composed of 「以」 (i), meaning 'beyond' or 'exceeding,' and 「外」 (gai), meaning 'outside.' Therefore, the literal meaning is 'outside of' or 'beyond something,' which translates to 'other than' or 'except for' in its grammatical usage.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「以外」 is used to express 'other than,' 'except for,' 'besides,' or 'in addition to.' It indicates something that is excluded from a group or something that is included as an additional item. It can be used with nouns, verbs, or adjectives.  When 「以外」 is used with verbs or adjectives, they must be in their dictionary form.  When used with a noun or na-adjective, it is typically followed by 「である」, though this is often omitted in casual speech.  The nuance can be exclusion, as in 'nothing but,' or addition, as in 'in addition to.' It is versatile and commonly used in everyday speech and writing.",
