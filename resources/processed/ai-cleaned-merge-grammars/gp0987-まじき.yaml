    "etymology": "The grammar point 「まじき」 is the attributive form of 「まじ」, an old-fashioned auxiliary verb expressing prohibition or strong negation. 「まじ」 itself is rarely used in modern conversation, having been largely replaced by 「まい」. 「まじき」 survives in formal expressions, often conveying the idea of something being 'unforgivable' or 'unacceptable'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「まじき」 is a formal expression indicating that something is unbecoming, unworthy, or unacceptable for a particular person or role. It carries a strong sense of disapproval or prohibition. The most common pattern is 「(A)にあるまじき(B)」, meaning \"(B) is unbecoming of (A)\". 「に」 can sometimes be replaced by 「として」, emphasizing the role or capacity in which the action is unacceptable. Another common pattern is 「許すまじき」, meaning \"unforgivable\" or \"intolerable\". This grammar point is generally used in formal writing and speech.",
