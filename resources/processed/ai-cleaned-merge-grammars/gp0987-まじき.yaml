    "etymology": "まじき derives from the classical Japanese auxiliary verb 「まじ」, meaning 'should not' or 'must not'. 「まじ」 is rarely used in modern Japanese outside of fixed expressions. 「まじき」 functions as an attributive form, modifying nouns to express that something is unbecoming or unacceptable for the person or thing described.",
    "writeup": "「まじき」 is the attributive form of 「まじ」, a classical auxiliary verb largely replaced by 「まい」 in modern Japanese. 「まじ」 itself means 'must not' or 'should not' but is now mostly confined to formal expressions. 「まじき」 often translates as 'not proper for (A)' or 'unbecoming of (A)'. The common pattern is (A)にあるまじき(B), where the case-marking particle 「に」 follows a noun, linked to the verb 「ある」, before 「まじき」 connects to a second noun. 「に」 can sometimes be replaced by 「として」, meaning 'as'. 「許すまじき」, meaning 'must not be forgiven' or 'unforgivable,' is another common pattern.",
