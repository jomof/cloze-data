    "etymology": "The grammar point 「まじき」 is the attributive form of 「まじ」, an old-fashioned auxiliary verb expressing prohibition or strong negation. 「まじ」 itself is rarely used in modern conversation, having been largely replaced by 「まい」. 「まじき」 survives in formal expressions, often conveying the idea of something being 'unforgivable' or 'unacceptable'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「まじき」 is a formal expression indicating that something is unbecoming, unworthy, or unacceptable for a particular person or role. It carries a strong sense of disapproval or prohibition. The most common pattern is 「(A)にあるまじき(B)」, meaning \"(B) is unbecoming of (A)\". 「に」 can sometimes be replaced by 「として」, emphasizing the role or capacity in which the action is unacceptable. Another common pattern is 「許すまじき」, meaning \"unforgivable\" or \"intolerable\". This grammar point is generally used in formal writing and speech. Its rigid structure and strong condemnatory nuance make it unsuitable for casual conversation.",

            "term": "まい",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「まい」 is a more common, modern equivalent for expressing negative volition or strong negative inference. While it can convey \"should not\" or \"must not\" similar to 「まじ」, it's broader in usage and not specifically tied to being \"unbecoming of\" a role like 「まじき」. It's often used in conjunction with a speaker's intention (e.g., 「もう行くまい」 - I won't go anymore) or a negative inference (e.g., 「そんなことはあるまい」 - That probably won't happen). 「まじき」 is fixed in its attributive form and specifically implies a failing related to a standard or expectation for a person or role."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "「まじき」 specifically highlights actions or qualities that are unsuitable for a particular role, status, or context, often implying a violation of ethical or customary standards. It carries a strong sense of moral or social condemnation. In contrast, 「まい」 primarily expresses a strong negative intention (\"will not,\" \"do not intend to\") or a negative conjecture (\"probably not,\" \"should not\"). While 「まい」 can sometimes overlap with 「まじき」 in meaning \"should not,\" its primary function is broader and less about the inherent suitability to a role. 「まじき」 is largely confined to formal or literary contexts, whereas 「まい」 is used more broadly in both formal and informal speech and writing.",
