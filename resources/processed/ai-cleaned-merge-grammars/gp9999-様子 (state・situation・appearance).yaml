details:
  part-of-speech: noun
  function: Describes the observable state, condition, or appearance of something or someone. Often used
    to infer or conjecture based on what is seen or heard.
  nuance: Implies a judgment or inference made from external observation rather than direct knowledge
    or objective fact. It focuses on the outward manifestation.
  colocation: Often used with verbs of perception like 見る (miru - to see), 伺う (ukagau - to infer), or
    to describe the general atmosphere or situation.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a noun describing state, but also as part of adverbial phrases or conjectural
    expressions when followed by だ.
etymology: The word 様子 (yōsu) is a compound of 様 (yō), meaning 'manner' or 'appearance,' and 子 (su), which
  here refers to a 'state' or 'condition.' Together, they convey the idea of the observable state, look,
  or general condition of something. This dual nature of 'manner' and 'state' underpins its versatile
  usage in describing both how things look and how situations are unfolding.
writeup: |-
  様子 (ようす) is a versatile noun in Japanese that primarily refers to the 'state,' 'situation,' 'appearance,' or 'circumstances' of something or someone. It is used when you are describing what you observe and infer from that observation, rather than stating a known fact. It's about how things 'look' or 'seem' to be.

  While 様子 itself is a noun, it frequently appears as part of a larger grammatical structure, most notably when expressing conjecture based on observation. When combined with a plain form verb or adjective followed by だ, it functions similarly to 'it seems that...' or 'it looks like...'. This construction indicates that the speaker is making a judgment or inference based on observable cues.

  For example, if you see someone yawning repeatedly, you might say 眠い 様子だ (nemui yōsu da - 'they seem sleepy'). You are not stating a definite fact, but rather an observation-based conclusion about their state. Similarly, if the sky is dark and cloudy, you might say 雨が降る 様子だ (ame ga furu yōsu da - 'it looks like rain').

  It can also be used directly as a noun, such as 彼の 様子 が おかしい (kare no yōsu ga okashii - 'his appearance/state is strange'), where it refers to an observable trait without necessarily implying conjecture.
false_friends:
  - term: らしい
    meaning: it seems, based on evidence, I hear
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 様子だ and らしい express conjecture, らしい often implies that the inference is based on
      indirect information or hearsay, or that something is typical of a certain type. 様子だ, however, primarily
      implies direct visual or auditory observation as the basis for the inference. For example, 彼は病気らしい
      (kare wa byōki rashii - 'He seems to be sick [based on what I heard/it's typical of him]') vs. 彼は病気の様子だ
      (kare wa byōki no yōsu da - 'He seems to be sick [based on his appearance]').
    grammar_point: らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)
  - term: そうだ
    meaning: appearance, hearsay
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The 'appearance' usage of そうだ (e.g., おいしそうだ - looks delicious) is similar to 様子だ in conveying
      observable appearance. However, そうだ generally attaches directly to the stem of adjectives or verbs
      (e.g., 食べそう - looks like it will eat), creating a more direct 'looks like' expression, often focusing
      on immediate visual cues. 様子だ is a noun construction that describes the state from which an appearance
      is inferred, and it can attach to plain forms of full clauses.
    grammar_point: い-Adjective[そう] (appearance)
  - term: ようだ・みたいだ
    meaning: seems・like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ようだ and みたいだ are direct expressions of conjecture or comparison, meaning 'it seems like' or
      'it's like'. They can be used when making a more general assumption or a comparison. 様子 is a noun
      referring to the 'appearance' or 'state' itself, and when combined with だ, it means 'it looks like'
      based specifically on that observable 'appearance' or 'state'. You might say 彼は疲れているようだ (kare wa
      tsukarete iru yō da - 'He seems tired [general impression]') or 彼は疲れている様子だ (kare wa tsukarete iru
      yōsu da - 'He seems tired [based on his appearance, e.g., yawning, heavy eyes]').
    grammar_point: 〜ようだ・〜みたいだ (seems・like)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between 様子 and other expressions like らしい, そうだ, and ようだ/みたいだ,
  consider the source of your inference. 様子 typically implies that your conclusion is drawn from direct
  observation of someone's or something's external state or appearance. In contrast, らしい often suggests
  indirect information or typical characteristics. そうだ (appearance) focuses on the immediate visual impression
  of a verb or adjective. ようだ/みたいだ are broader terms for conjecture or comparison, often reflecting a
  more general impression or analogy, not solely reliant on observable 'state' as 様子 implies.

          - 彼 は おかしい です。
        english: He is strange.
        hint: While 「彼はおかしい」 means he is strange, the grammar point 「様子」 specifies that it is his 'appearance'
          or 'state' that is strange, providing more detail. We're looking for how his state looks strange.

        english: It seems the meeting has already ended (based on indirect information).
        hint: 「らしい」 and 「ようだ」 can also express conjecture, but 「様子だ」 implies your inference is based on
          direct observation of the 'state' of things, like people leaving. We're looking for a judgment
          based on an observed state.

          - 子供 は 眠 そう でし た。
        english: The child looked sleepy.
        hint: 「眠そう」 is a direct visual appearance, like 'looking sleepy'. While similar, 「眠い様子だった」 emphasizes
          that their general 'state' or 'condition' suggested sleepiness, not just their facial expression.
          We're looking for an inference about their overall state.

        hint: 「来る気がない」 refers to a lack of motivation or willingness. 「来る様子がない」 implies that based on

          We're looking for an observation of his current state or lack thereof.

post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 様子 can be used with various parts of speech to describe
  an observed state or appearance. Whether it's the simple noun usage like 彼の様子がおかしい or forming a conjectural
  phrase like 雨の様子だ, it consistently points to an inference based on what is outwardly visible or perceptible.
  Pay attention to the particle that connects 様子 to the preceding clause or noun (の, な, or plain form)
  as this indicates the type of observation being made.
