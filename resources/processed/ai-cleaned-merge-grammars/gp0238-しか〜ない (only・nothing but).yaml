jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: casual
  usage-context: general
etymology: The particle 「しか」 likely evolved from a combination of 「し」 (an emphatic particle) and 「か」 (a
  question particle). Over time, it transitioned to its current exclusive meaning, always used with a
  negative predicate.
writeup: |-
  The particle 「しか」 serves to express exclusivity or limitation, akin to the English "only" or "nothing but." It is a distinguishing feature of 「しか」 that it must always be paired with a negative predicate, most commonly the plain negative form 「ない」 or the polite negative 「ません」. This inherent negativity is why 「しか〜ない」 is often translated as "there is nothing but (X)" or "only (X) exists," emphasizing the singular presence or characteristic of X.

  「しか」 primarily functions with nouns, pronouns, or quantity expressions to limit the scope to only that element. For example, 「水 しか 飲ま ない」 means "I drink nothing but water," highlighting that no other beverage is consumed. It denotes a strict boundary or a singular focus.

  It is crucial to differentiate 「しか〜ない」 from a related, but distinct, grammatical construction where 「しかない」 directly follows a verb in its plain form (e.g., 「するしかない」). In that context, 「しかない」 translates to "have no choice but to do X" or "X is the only option," indicating a lack of alternatives. This specific lesson focuses exclusively on 「しか」 as a limiting particle used with nouns and quantities.
false_friends:
  - term: だけ
    meaning: Only, just
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「しか」, 「だけ」 can be used with affirmative verbs. 「水 だけ 飲む」 means "I only drink water,"
      focusing on the quantity without the strong implication of limitation or negativity that 「しか」 carries.
    grammar_point: だけ (only・just)
  - term: ばかり
    meaning: Only, just, nothing but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ばかり」 often implies repetition or doing nothing else, sometimes with a negative connotation.
      「食べて ばかり いる」 means "You're always just eating." It can also mean "just finished."
    grammar_point: ばかり (only・excessive)
  - term: でしかない
    meaning: Merely, nothing but, no more than
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is used to emphasize that something is nothing more than what it is, often suggesting
      insignificance or a lack of depth. 「単なる 偶然 で しか ない」 (It's merely a coincidence). It expresses exclusivity
      of a different kind – a lack of additional qualities or meaning.
    grammar_point: でしかない (merely・nothing but)
  - term: しかない
    meaning: Have no choice but, only, just
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is a distinct grammar point. When 「しかない」 follows a plain verb form (e.g., 「するしかない」),
      it means "have no choice but to do X" or "X is the only option." It implies an unavoidable action
      due to lack of alternatives. This differs from 「しか〜ない」 (noun + negative verb), which limits the
      scope to a specific noun/quantity.
    grammar_point: しかない (have no choice but)
  - term: にほかならない
    meaning: Nothing but, none other than, simply
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: A more formal and definitive expression than 「しか〜ない」, used to assert that something is precisely
      what it appears to be and nothing else. 「彼 の 成功 は 努力 に ほかならない」 (His success is nothing but hard
      work). It expresses identity or cause, not merely a limited quantity or item.
    grammar_point: にほかならない (nothing but)
  - term: きり
    meaning: Only, just, Since
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「だけ」 and 「しか」 in expressing limitation. 「一人 きり」 (only one person). However, 「きり」
      can also mean "since" (e.g., 「会った きり」 since we met) or imply doing something until a certain point.
      It doesn't inherently carry the negative predicate requirement of 「しか」.
    grammar_point: きり (only・since)
  - term: を置いて他に〜ない
    meaning: Nothing else compares
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: A more emphatic and often literary expression of exclusivity, similar to "there is no one/nothing
      else but X." 「彼 を おいてほかに 適任 者 は いない」 (There's no one else suitable but him). It implies that the
      item/person mentioned is uniquely qualified or exceptional, making others unsuitable.
    grammar_point: を置いて他に〜ない (nothing else compares)
  - term: ただ〜のみ
    meaning: Nothing but, only, all that remains
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ただ〜のみ」 is a highly formal and literary expression emphasizing exclusivity, often used to
      imply that nothing else exists or remains. Unlike 「しか〜ない」, it does not require a negative predicate
      but inherently conveys an exhaustive limitation. It suggests a bare minimum or a singular focus
      with a grander, more formal tone.
    grammar_point: ただ〜のみ (nothing but)
  - term: のみ
    meaning: Only, just, nothing but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「のみ」 is a more formal and literary equivalent of 「だけ」, meaning 'only' or 'just'. Like 「だけ」,
      it can be used with affirmative verbs and does not carry the strong negative implication or the
      mandatory negative predicate of 「しか〜ない」. It is typically seen in written language or very formal
      speech.
    grammar_point: のみ (only・just)
  - term: にすぎない
    meaning: No more than, just, merely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「にすぎない」 expresses that something is 'no more than' or 'merely' a certain thing, often implying
      that its importance or extent is limited and perhaps less than what might be assumed. It carries
      a sense of downplaying or trivializing, focusing on the insufficient nature of something. While
      「しか〜ない」 states exclusivity, 「にすぎない」 emphasizes insufficiency or lack of significance.
    grammar_point: にすぎない (no more than)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「しか〜ない」 emphasizes exclusivity through its mandatory pairing with a
  negative verb, conveying a sense of scarcity, strong limitation, or slight negative nuance, several
  other expressions convey similar ideas with distinct implications. 「だけ」 and its more formal counterpart
  「のみ」 simply mean "only" or "just" and can be used with affirmative verbs, lacking the inherent negative
  connotation of 「しか」. 「ばかり」 suggests an excessive focus or a continuous state, often with a slight critical
  tone, or can indicate something has "just finished." 「でしかない」 and 「にすぎない」 both express that something
  is "merely" or "nothing more than" a certain thing, often implying insignificance or a lack of depth
  beyond that stated. The distinct grammar point 「しかない」 (when following a verb) indicates having "no choice
  but" to do something, highlighting a lack of alternatives rather than a quantitative or qualitative
  limitation. More emphatic and formal expressions like 「にほかならない」, 「ただ〜のみ」, and 「を置いて他に〜ない」 are used to
  assert that something is precisely what it appears to be, or that nothing else compares to it, conveying
  a stronger sense of definitive exclusivity or unique suitability.
examples:
  - english: There's nothing but water in my refrigerator.
    japanese:
      - 私 の 冷蔵 庫 に は 水 {しか} 入っ て {い ない}。
      - 私 の 冷蔵 庫 に は 水 {しか} 入っ て {い ませ ん}。
    english_literally: In my refrigerator, only water is contained not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の 冷蔵 庫 に は 水 だけ 入っ て いる。
        english: There's only water in my refrigerator (and nothing else of note).
        hint: The nuance of 'only' here is a simple statement of fact, not emphasizing scarcity or a negative
          situation. We're looking for an expression that implies a lack or negative outcome.
    scene: A person opening their fridge and commenting on its contents to a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: The phrase 「しか入っていない」 emphasizes the absence of anything else besides water, implying a strong
      limitation or even a lack of variety. It highlights that the refrigerator contains only water, and
      nothing else.
    etymology: The negative verb 「いない」 comes from 「いる」 which means 'to exist' or 'to be present.' The
      negative form with 「しか」 signifies the non-existence of anything beyond the stated item, creating
      a strong sense of exclusivity.
  - english: There's only one week left until the exam.
    japanese:
      - 試験 まで 残り 一 週間 {しか} {ない}。
      - 試験 まで 残り 一 週間 {しか} {あり ませ ん}。
    english_literally: Until exam, remaining one week only is not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 試験 まで 残り 一 週間 だけ だ。
        english: There's only one week left until the exam (a neutral statement).
        hint: This expression simply states a limited quantity. We're looking for a phrase that implies
          a strong sense of limitation or urgency.
    scene: A student realizing the short amount of time before a test.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: The use of 「しか〜ない」 here creates a sense of scarcity and urgency, implying that one week is
      a very limited amount of time. It emphasizes the strict boundary of the remaining time, often with
      a feeling of pressure.
    etymology: 「ない」 (to not exist, to not be) is used with 「しか」 to convey that nothing more than one week
      exists, emphasizing the strict limit and the lack of additional time.
  - english: Only she understands my troubles.
    japanese:
      - 私 の 悩み は、彼女 {しか} 理解 し て くれ {ない}。
      - 私 の 悩み は、彼女 {しか} 理解 し て くれ {ませ ん}。
    english_literally: My troubles, only she understands for me not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の 悩み は、彼女 だけ が 理解 し て くれる。
        english: As for my troubles, only she understands them.
        hint: This phrase sounds more like a neutral statement about who understands. We're looking for
          an expression that emphasizes the exclusivity of who understands, often implying a sense of
          uniqueness or irreplaceable value.
    scene: Someone confiding in a close friend about a personal issue.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「〜てくれない」 implies that the action (understanding) is done for the speaker's benefit,
      and the negative form with 「しか」 reinforces that only this person provides that benefit, highlighting
      a unique and perhaps irreplaceable bond. The use of 「私 の 悩み は」 suggests a personal, perhaps intimate,
      topic often discussed among close female friends.
    etymology: The verb 「理解 する」 means 'to understand.' When combined with 「〜てくれる」, it indicates an action
      done for the speaker's benefit. The negative 「くれない」 with 「しか」 emphatically states that no one else
      extends this understanding.
  - english: He thinks of nothing but chasing his dreams.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 夢 を 追いかける こと {しか} 考え {ない}。
      - 彼 は 夢 を 追いかける こと {しか} 考え {ませ ん}。
    english_literally: He, chasing dreams thing only thinks not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 夢 を 追いかける こと だけ 考え て いる。
        english: He only thinks about chasing his dreams (neutral, descriptive).
        hint: This expression simply states what he thinks about. We're looking for a phrase that implies
          a strong focus to the exclusion of all other thoughts, almost to a fault.
    scene: A mentor discussing a driven protégé.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The structure 「〜しか考えない」 highlights an exclusive preoccupation, implying that other considerations
      are entirely absent from his thoughts. This is a common phrasing to describe someone deeply devoted
      to a single pursuit, often used by an older, more experienced speaker to describe a younger person's
      drive. The use of 「彼 は」 emphasizes the subject's singular focus.
    etymology: 「考える」 means 'to think.' The combination with 「しか〜ない」 indicates that no other thoughts exist
      for the subject. This formation expresses a complete lack of consideration for anything outside
      of the stated focus.
  - english: At this time, there's only one bus left to the airport.
    japanese:
      - この 時間 なら、空港 へ 行く バス は もう 一 本 {しか} {ない}。
      - この 時間 なら、空港 へ 行く バス は もう 一 本 {しか} {あり ませ ん}。

      - competing_japanese:
          - この 時間 なら、空港 へ 行く バス は もう 一 本 だけ だ。
        english: This time, there's only one bus left to the airport (neutral statement).
        hint: This expresses a simple count. We're looking for an expression that conveys a sense of limited
          options and potential inconvenience due to the scarcity.
    scene: A traveler at a bus stop realizing they're running out of options.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: The 「しか〜ない」 here conveys a sense of limited options and urgency, implying that due to the
      late hour, there are no other buses available. It highlights the restrictive nature of the situation
      for the traveler.
    etymology: The phrase 「もう 一 本」 means 'already one (long cylindrical object/bus).' Combined with 「しか〜ない」,
      it strongly indicates that only this single option remains, with all others having ceased to exist
      or be available.
  - english: My smartphone only has 1GB of data left.
    japanese:
      - 私 の スマホ に は、データ が １ ギガ {しか} 残っ て {い ない}。

          - 私 の スマホ に は、データ が １ ギガ だけ 残っ て いる。
        english: My smartphone has only 1GB of data left (as a neutral statement).
        hint: This phrasing simply states the amount. We're looking for an expression that emphasizes
          the scarcity of the data, implying it's not enough or problematic.
    scene: A teenager checking their phone data usage with concern.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The usage here emphasizes a limited amount of data, implying it is insufficient or problematic.
      The casual phrasing and concern about phone data are typical of a younger speaker. The use of 「私
      の スマホ に は」 establishes the direct relevance to the speaker's personal device.
    etymology: 「残っている」 means 'to be remaining.' The negative 「いない」 with 「しか」 emphasizes that only a meager
      1GB exists, underscoring the scarcity and potential inconvenience caused by such a limited amount.
  - english: Only specific staff are allowed to enter this room.
    japanese:
      - この 部屋 は、特定 の スタッフ {しか} 入れ {ない} よう に なっ て いる。

        english: This room is set up so that only specific staff can enter.
        hint: This option expresses the exclusivity more neutrally. We's looking for a phrase that implies
          a strict restriction or prohibition for others, emphasizing the exclusion.
    scene: A security guard explaining access rules for a restricted area.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 「〜しか入れない」 explicitly states that no one else can enter, conveying a sense of strictness
      and security. This is often used in professional or instructional contexts to define restricted
      access, aligning with a male security guard's role. The structure 「〜ようになっている」 further formalizes
      this as an an established rule or system.
    etymology: The potential form 「入れる」 (can enter) combined with 「しか〜ない」 signifies that entry is restricted
      to specific individuals, with no other individuals having the ability to enter. 「ように なっている」 indicates
      a state or rule that has come to be.
  - english: It's hard to get tickets for that singer's concert. That's because it's only held once a
      year.
    japanese:

      not because.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 歌手 の コンサート は、チケット が なかなか 手 に 入ら ない。年 に 一 度 だけ 開催 さ れる から だ。
        english: It's hard to get tickets for that singer's concert. That's because it's only held once
          a year (neutral frequency).
        hint: This expresses the frequency as a simple fact. We're looking for a phrase that emphasizes
          the rarity as a strong limitation, directly linking it to the difficulty of obtaining tickets.
    scene: Two fans discussing the difficulty of attending a concert.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: The 「しか〜ない」 highlights the infrequency of the concert, implying that this rarity is the direct
      cause of the difficulty in obtaining tickets. It emphasizes the severe limitation on opportunity.
      The particle 「から」 reinforces the causal relationship.
    etymology: 「開催 される」 means 'to be held.' The negative form 「されない」 with 「しか」 underscores that it is
      held only once a year, stressing the extremely limited frequency of the event and its impact on
      ticket availability.
  - english: I only have 500 yen in my wallet.
    japanese:

    english_literally: My wallet in, 500 yen only is not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の 財布 に は ５００ 円 だけ ある。
        english: I have only 500 yen in my wallet (neutral statement).
        hint: This simply states the amount. We're looking for a phrase that implies a strong limitation
          or a feeling of not having enough money.
    scene: A student checking their wallet before lunch.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: The use of 「しか〜ない」 here emphasizes the scarcity of money, implying that 500 yen is a very
      limited amount and possibly insufficient for what they need or want. It conveys a feeling of disappointment
      or mild distress due to the lack of more funds. The phrase 「私 の 財布 に は」 sets the personal context.
    etymology: 「ない」 here indicates non-existence of anything beyond 500 yen, highlighting the strict limitation
      of funds.
  - english: He can only speak a little Japanese.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 日本 語 が 少し {しか} 話せ {ない}。
      - 彼 は 日本 語 が 少し {しか} 話せ {ませ ん}。
    english_literally: He, Japanese a little only can speak not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 少し だけ 日本 語 を 話せる。
        english: He can speak only a little Japanese (neutral statement of ability).
        hint: This is a neutral statement about his Japanese ability. We're looking for an expression
          that emphasizes the limit of his ability, often implying that it's insufficient or not impressive.
    scene: Colleagues discussing a new foreign team member's Japanese proficiency.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The phrase 「少し しか 話せ ない」 highlights the limited extent of his Japanese ability, suggesting
      that it might be insufficient for certain situations or that he wishes he could speak more. This
      phrasing is common in informative settings when evaluating someone's skills.
    etymology: The potential form 「話せる」 (can speak) combined with 「しか〜ない」 indicates a restriction on the
      degree to which something can be done, emphasizing that only a small amount of proficiency exists.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「しか〜ない」 is used to emphasize a strict limit or exclusivity,
  often implying a sense of scarcity, difficulty, or lack of alternatives. Notice how the negative verb
  is integral to conveying that "nothing but" or "only" the specified item/quantity/action exists.
