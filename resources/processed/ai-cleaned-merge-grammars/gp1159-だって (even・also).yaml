id: gp1159
meaning: even; too; also (expressing emphasis or inclusion)
pronunciation:
  katakana: ダッテ
  romaji: datte
formation:
  Noun + だって: Indicates that the noun is included or emphasized, meaning 'even that noun' or 'that noun
    too'.
  Plain Verb + だって: Indicates that the action is included or emphasized, meaning 'even doing that' or
    'doing that too'.
  Plain い-Adjective + だって: Indicates that the adjective is included or emphasized, meaning 'even that
    adjective' or 'that adjective too'.
  Plain な-Adjective + だって: 'Indicates that the adjective is included or emphasized, meaning ''even that
    adjective'' or ''that adjective too''. (Note: The な particle is dropped when だって follows a な-adjective
    in plain form, e.g., 暇だ + だって becomes 暇だって.)'
jlpt: N3
etymology: The word だって is thought to be a contraction of 「と」 (quotative particle) + 「言って」 (itte, the
  te-form of 言う 'to say'). Originally, it might have meant 'even if one says' or 'even if it is said that'.
  This etymological root explains its function of including or emphasizing something by bringing it into
  focus as if it were a statement being made or considered. Over time, it developed its usage as a particle
  signifying 'even' or 'also'.
writeup: |-
  The particle だって is a versatile and common expression in casual Japanese conversation, primarily used to add emphasis, inclusion, or a sense of 'even' or 'too'. It signals that the preceding word or phrase is being brought into consideration, often with an element of surprise or an unexpected twist. Think of it as saying, 'You know what? *Even* this!' or 'And *this*, too!'

  When だって follows a noun, it emphasizes that noun as being part of a group or affected by a situation, similar to 'even a child' or 'even me'. For example, if you're listing things you don't like, and someone suggests something you particularly dislike, you might say, 「ビールだって嫌い！」 (I hate beer, *too*!) to show that even that item is included.

  Following verbs and adjectives in their plain forms, だって adds the same emphatic or inclusive nuance. It can highlight an action or state as being 'even' possible, 'even' true, or 'also' happening. For instance, 「そんなこと、僕だって知らないよ。」 (Even *I* don't know that kind of thing.) Here, it expresses a mild protest or assertion, as if to say, 'Don't assume I know everything; even *I* am unaware.'

  だ-adjectives typically drop the だ before だって, becoming, for example, 暇だって (even if I'm free). This reflects the casual, colloquial nature of だって, where some grammatical connections are simplified.

  While だって always conveys a sense of emphasis or inclusion, the specific nuance can shift depending on context and intonation. It can express mild surprise, a gentle protest, a straightforward addition, or even resignation.

  - term: だって
    meaning: because; but; I mean (for explanation or protest)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This だって introduces a reason or an explanation, often with a defensive or protesting tone.
      It's like saying 'I mean, it's because...' or 'That's not fair, because...'. It provides justification
      for a previous statement or action.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:だって (because・but)
  - term: さえ
    meaning: even; if only; just
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: さえ emphasizes an extreme or minimal case, often suggesting that if even that minimal condition
      is met, then something else will follow easily. It often has a sense of 'even just this much' or
      'only this' and can imply a surprising or unlikely inclusion.
    grammar_point: さえ (even・if only)
  - term: も
    meaning: also; too; both; either
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: も is a neutral particle simply indicating inclusion or addition, without the strong emphasis,
      surprise, or mild protest that だって can carry. While だって can often replace も for added emphasis,
      も cannot always replace だって when the nuance of 'even' or 'surprisingly' is present.
    grammar_point: も (addition or emphasis particle)
post_false_friends_writeup: When differentiating between the two だって forms, pay close attention to the
  context and what follows. The 'because' だって usually comes at the beginning of a clause and provides
  an explanation for something that was just said or implied. The 'even/also' だって follows a noun, verb,
  or adjective, emphasizing that specific element. To distinguish だって from さえ, remember that さえ often
  focuses on a minimum condition or an extreme case ('if even X, then Y'), while だって broadly emphasizes
  an inclusion or unexpected addition. For も, だって is simply a more emphatic version. If you could replace
  it with a simple 'also' or 'too' without losing much nuance, then も might be sufficient, but だって adds
  a stronger emotional or surprising tone.

  - english: Even I can do something like this.

        english: I can also do something like this.
        hint: Using も here would indicate that 'I' am simply another person who can do it, but だって adds
          a slight emphasis, suggesting 'even someone like me' can do it, possibly implying a sense of
          surprise or mild assertion. We're looking for an emphasis on 'even'.
