    "writeup": "The expression 「{たかが}」 is used to downplay the significance or importance of something. It conveys a sense that something is \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"merely\" of the specified nature. It's often used to express a dismissive or minimizing attitude toward the subject.\n\nIt can be used in various ways:\n\n*   **たかが + Noun:** To describe something as not very important.  For example, 「たかが風邪」 means \"it's just a cold\".\n*   **たかが + Noun + くらいで/と:**  To indicate that something is not worth getting worked up about.  For example, 「たかが少し遅れたくらいで」 means \"just for being a little late\".\n*   **たかが知れている:** This phrase means \"doesn't amount to much\" or \"limited\", indicating that the speaker believes something's capabilities or value are minimal.",
    "etymology": "「たかが」 likely originates from the verb 「高が (takaga)」 which means \"at most\" or \"at best.\" Over time, it evolved into an adverbial noun that emphasizes the small or insignificant nature of something.",
