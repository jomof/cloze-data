        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "Generally used in casual contexts, but can be employed in more formal settings to convey a dismissive or minimizing tone. Often implies that the speaker considers the subject to be of little consequence.",
        "function": "To express that the referent of the modified noun or noun phrase is insignificant, of little value, or not a big deal.",
        "nuance": "The speaker minimizes the importance, value, or impact of something. It can convey a sense of condescension or a lack of concern, implying that the matter is not worth much attention or worry.",
        "colocation": "Often used with 「くらい」, 「知れている」, or followed by expressions of not needing to worry or overreact.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a noun modifier or adverbial phrase, emphasizing the triviality of the following noun or clause.",
        "logical-flow": "Sets a premise that something is insignificant, often leading to a conclusion that actions or reactions based on that thing are unwarranted or exaggerated."
    },
    "etymology": "「たかが」 likely originates from the verb 「高が (takaga)」, which historically meant \"at most\" or \"at best.\" Over time, its meaning evolved to emphasize the small, limited, or insignificant nature of something, functioning adverbially to downplay importance.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「{たかが}」 is used to minimize the significance, importance, or value of a particular thing or situation. It translates to \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"merely,\" conveying the speaker's dismissive or condescending attitude towards the subject. It is commonly used to argue that something is not a big deal or not worth excessive concern.\n\n「{たかが}」 can be used in several ways:\n\n*   **たかが + Noun**: This is the most straightforward use, directly stating that a noun is insignificant. For example, 「たかが風邪」 means \"it's just a cold.\"\n*   **たかが + Noun/Number + くらい/と/で**: When combined with particles like 「くらい」, 「と」, or 「で」, it intensifies the dismissive tone, implying that the subsequent action or reaction is an overstatement given the triviality of the preceding noun. For example, 「たかがテストの結果くらいで」 means \"just for a test result (you shouldn't overreact).\"\n*   **たかが + Verb/い-adjective/な-adjective (plain form) + くらい (のこと)で**: This construction applies 「たかが」 to verbs or adjectives, suggesting that the action, state, or quality is trivial. For instance, 「たかが少し遅れたくらいで」 means \"just for being a little late.\"\n*   **たかが知れている**: This is a fixed phrase meaning \"its extent is limited\" or \"it doesn't amount to much.\" It expresses the belief that something's capabilities, knowledge, or value are minimal.",

To avoid confusion, remember that 「たかが」 carries a subjective judgment about insignificance, whereas 「ただの」 describes inherent commonness and 「たった」 quantifies smallness.",
