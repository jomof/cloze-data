        "Register": "Formal",
        "Function": "To indicate a parallel relationship where one event or situation changes in proportion to another.",
        "Nuance": "Implies a natural progression or consequence due to a preceding factor. The \"に従い\" form is slightly more formal than \"に従って\".",
        "Related Expressions": "につれて (nitsurete); つれ (tsure)"

    "etymology": "The grammar point derives from the verb 「従う」(shitagau), which means \"to obey\" or \"to follow\". The に (ni) particle indicates direction or purpose, thus 「に従って」 literally means \"following in accordance with\".",
    "writeup": "「に従って」 and 「従い」 are used to express that something changes or progresses in proportion to something else. Think of it as a parallel progression—as one thing happens, so does another. The form 「に従い」 is slightly more formal and often found in written language. You'll often see this pattern: Aの変化**に従って**Bも変化する (A no henka ni **shitagatte** B mo henka suru): \"As A changes, B also changes.\"",
