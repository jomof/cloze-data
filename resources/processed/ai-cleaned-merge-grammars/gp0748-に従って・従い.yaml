        "[Verb in dictionary form] + に従って/従い": "Indicates that something spontaneously and gradually occurs in accordance with some change.",

        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "function": "To indicate a parallel relationship where one event or situation changes in proportion to another, or to express adherence to rules or instructions.",
        "nuance": "Implies a natural progression or consequence due to a preceding factor. The 「に従い」 form is slightly more formal and literary than 「に従って」, often found in written contexts or formal speeches. It can denote both a proportional, continuous change and a strict adherence to something."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point derives from the verb 「従う」(shitagau), which means \"to obey\" or \"to follow\". The に (ni) particle indicates direction or purpose, thus 「に従って」 literally means \"following in accordance with\". This etymological root explains its dual usage: both following a natural progression and following a rule or instruction.",
    "writeup": "「に従って」 and 「従い」 are versatile grammatical patterns used to express two primary relationships: proportional change and adherence. Both forms are generally formal, with 「に従い」 being particularly common in written language or very formal spoken contexts due to its conjunctive `連用形` (ren'yōkei) form. \n\n**Proportional Change (Verb + に従って/従い)**\nThis usage indicates that as one thing changes or progresses, another thing also changes or progresses in tandem. It suggests a continuous and often inevitable correlation between two phenomena. For example, as time passes, something else gradually happens. This nuance emphasizes a natural or logical progression, rather than a single cause-and-effect event.\n\n**Adherence/Compliance (Noun + に従って/従い)**\nIn this usage, the pattern signifies that an action is performed \"in accordance with,\" \"following,\" or \"based on\" a specific rule, instruction, standard, or agreement. It conveys a sense of obedience, compliance, or strict observance. This is commonly seen in business, legal, or official contexts where following established procedures is crucial.\n\n**Distinguishing Forms**\n「に従って」 and 「に従い」 are largely interchangeable in meaning for both usages, but 「に従い」 is perceived as more formal and literary. 「に従って」 functions as a conjunctive particle, connecting clauses, while 「に従い」 is the `連用形` (conjunctive form) of the verb 「従う」, which can act as a conjunction or connect to another verb.",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「に従って・従い」, which can mean \"in accordance with\" (following rules/instructions), 「につれて」 primarily emphasizes the progressive change or correlation between two actions or states. It implies a more natural, less rule-bound progression."

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「に従って・従い」 and 「につれて・つれ」 express a correlation where one thing changes in proportion to another, a key distinction lies in the nuance of causation or adherence. 「に従って・従い」 can specifically imply acting in accordance with a rule, instruction, or plan, in addition to progressive change. In contrast, 「につれて・つれ」 is used exclusively for describing a natural, progressive correlation where one change leads to another without implying a deliberate following of rules. Furthermore, 「〜通りに」 implies exact replication or adherence to a pattern, whereas 「〜に基づいて」 suggests using something as a foundation. 「に従って・従い」 occupies a middle ground, encompassing both proportional change and adherence to guidelines or instructions without necessarily implying exact replication or being merely a foundation.",
