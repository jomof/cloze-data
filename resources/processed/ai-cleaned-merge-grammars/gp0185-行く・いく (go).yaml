    "etymology": "The verb 「行く (iku)」 originally comes from the Old Japanese verb 「往く (iku)」, with the same meaning of 'to go'. Over time, the kanji 「行」 became the standard representation, while the meaning remained consistent. It is one of the core verbs in the Japanese language, fundamental for expressing movement.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「行く (iku)」 means \"to go\" and describes movement. Crucially, it indicates movement *away* from the speaker or the speaker's *viewpoint*. This viewpoint is not necessarily the speaker's physical location; it can be an imagined or assumed point of reference. For example, if you are at point C, but mentally consider point A as your reference point (e.g., your home), you would use 「行く」 to describe movement towards A. It is often paired with particles like 「に」 or 「へ」 to specify the destination. The polite form is 「行きます (ikimasu)」. This verb is fundamental for expressing directional movement in Japanese and is often contrasted with 「来る (kuru)」, which signifies movement *towards* the speaker or the speaker's viewpoint.",
