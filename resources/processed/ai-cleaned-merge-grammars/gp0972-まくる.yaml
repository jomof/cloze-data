    "formation": {
        "Verb[ます stem] + まくる": "Indicates performing an action repeatedly, intensely, or without restraint."
    },
    "jlpt": "N1",
    "meaning": "To do something excessively, relentlessly, or without restraint; to do like crazy or on and on",
    "meaning_warning": "まくる is sometimes used as a noun in the pattern Verb[ます stem] + まくり + だ, indicating a state of excessive action.",
    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "auxiliary verb",
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "Used to emphasize the intensity, frequency, or recklessness of an action. Often implies a lack of control or thought for consequences.",
        "function": "Intensifier, repetition marker",
        "nuance": "Implies an action done vigorously, excessively, or heedlessly. Can convey both positive (e.g., having a lot of fun) and negative (e.g., losing control) connotations.",
        "source": "Derived from the verb めくる (mekuru), meaning 'to turn over' or 'to flip', suggesting repeated action.",
        "grammatical-role": "Modifies the preceding verb, adding a sense of over-the-top action."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「まくる」 originates from the verb 「捲る (めくる)」, which means \"to roll up,\" \"to turn over,\" or \"to flip.\" This etymology conveys the core idea of repeated or continuous action, as if one is constantly \"turning over\" or cycling through the action. Over time, its meaning evolved to encompass the intensity and lack of restraint seen in its modern usage.",
    "writeup": "「まくる」 is an auxiliary verb that attaches to the **ます-stem** of other verbs. It expresses that an action is being performed with great intensity, frequency, or without restraint. It essentially conveys the meaning of \"doing [verb] like crazy,\" \"doing nothing but [verb],\" or \"constantly doing [verb].\"\n\nThis expression is versatile and can be used in both positive and negative contexts, depending on the main verb and the situation. However, it often carries a nuance of recklessness or abandon, implying that the speaker or subject is not considering the consequences of their repeated or vigorous actions. It's crucial to note that the verb preceding 「まくる」 must be **volitional**, meaning it is an action that the subject has control over and can repeat.\n\nKey characteristics of 「まくる」:\n*   **Attachment**: Always connects to the ます-stem of a verb (e.g., 食べる → 食べまくる, 読む → 読みまくる).\n*   **Intensity/Frequency**: Highlights that an action is done a lot, very enthusiastically, or repeatedly.\n*   **Nuance**: Frequently suggests a lack of inhibition, doing something \"to an extreme,\" or being consumed by an action.\n*   **Volitional Verbs**: Strictly applies to verbs that describe intentional actions.",
