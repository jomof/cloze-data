        "usage-context": "Used to emphasize the intensity, frequency, or recklessness of an action. Often implies a lack of control or thought for consequences.",
        "function": "Intensifier, repetition marker",
        "nuance": "Implies an action done vigorously, excessively, or heedlessly. Can convey both positive (e.g., having a lot of fun) and negative (e.g., losing control) connotations.",
        "grammatical-role": "Modifies the preceding verb, adding a sense of over-the-top action."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「まくる」 originates from the verb 「捲る (めくる)」, which means \"to roll up,\" \"to turn over,\" or \"to flip.\" This etymology conveys the core idea of repeated or continuous action, as if one is constantly \"turning over\" or cycling through the action. This connection between 'turning over' and 'repeated/excessive action' highlights the visual imagery of continuous, vigorous motion, much like continuously turning pages or rolling something over and over. Over time, its meaning evolved to encompass the intensity and lack of restraint seen in its modern usage.",
    "writeup": "「まくる」 is an auxiliary verb that attaches to the **ます-stem** of other verbs. It expresses that an action is being performed with great intensity, frequency, or without restraint. It essentially conveys the meaning of \"doing [verb] like crazy,\" \"doing nothing but [verb],\" or \"constantly doing [verb].\"\n\nThis expression is versatile and can be used in both positive and negative contexts, depending on the main verb and the situation. However, it often carries a nuance of recklessness or abandon, implying that the speaker or subject is not considering the consequences of their repeated or vigorous actions. It's crucial to note that the verb preceding 「まくる」 must be **volitional**, meaning it is an action that the subject has control over and can repeat.\n\nWhile primarily used as an auxiliary verb, the ます-stem + まくり form can also function as a noun, typically followed by だ (e.g., 食べまくりだ - 'It's a food spree'), to describe the state or result of excessive action.\n\nKey characteristics of 「まくる」:\n*   **Attachment**: Always connects to the ます-stem of a verb (e.g., 食べる → 食べまくる, 読む → 読みまくる).\n*   **Intensity/Frequency**: Highlights that an action is done a lot, very enthusiastically, or repeatedly.\n*   **Nuance**: Frequently suggests a lack of inhibition, doing something \"to an extreme,\" or being consumed by an action.\n*   **Volitional Verbs**: Strictly applies to verbs that describe intentional actions.",

            "nuance": "「Verb[ます stem] + まくり + だ」 treats the excessive action as a noun, often referring to the *result* or *state* of the action (e.g., 'a shopping spree', 'a reading marathon'). In contrast, 「まくる」 functions as a verb, describing the action itself with intensity and repetition."

One could be 食べまくる (eating excessively) while also doing other things, but 食べるばかり (only eating) excludes other activities."
