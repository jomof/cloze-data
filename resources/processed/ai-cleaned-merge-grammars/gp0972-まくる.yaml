    "writeup": "「まくる」is a verb that attaches to the ます-stem of other verbs to express doing something to a great extent, repeatedly, or recklessly. It conveys the idea of doing (A) over and over, a lot, or with great vigor. The etymology comes from the verb 「捲る」, meaning \"to roll up\" or \"to turn over,\" suggesting doing something repeatedly. Common translations include \"to (A) like crazy,\" \"to do nothing but (A),\" and \"to constantly do (A).\"\n\n*   It attaches to the ます-stem of other verbs.\n*   It can be used in both positive and negative contexts.\n*   It often implies that (A) is being done recklessly or with abandon, without thinking about the consequences.\n\n**Important Consideration:** The (A) verb must be volitional, meaning the speaker has control over it and its repetition.",
