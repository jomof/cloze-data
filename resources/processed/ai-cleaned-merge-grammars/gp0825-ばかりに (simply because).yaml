etymology: The grammar point 「ばかりに」 is derived from 「ばかり」, which means "just" or "only," combined with
  the particle 「に」. The 「ばかり」 can be traced back to the verb 「測る (はかる)」 (hakaru) meaning 'to measure,'
  implying a limited extent or degree. 「に」 indicates the reason or cause. Historically, ばかり shares etymological
  roots with 許す (yurusu) meaning 'to allow' or 'to forgive,' which has a nuance of 'letting through' or
  'permitting a minimum amount.' This sense of 'just this much' or 'only this' leading to a consequence
  is retained in ばかりに, often highlighting a surprisingly significant result from a minimal cause.
writeup: 「ばかりに」 is a grammatical construction used to convey that something occurred **simply because**
  of a specific reason or situation. It frequently carries a nuance of regret or highlights an an unexpected
  negative outcome resulting from a particular cause. The structure is attached to the plain past form
  of verbs, the plain form of い-adjectives, the stem of な-adjectives (followed by な, である, だった, or であった),
  or nouns (followed by である, だった, or であった). While it is most commonly associated with negative consequences,
  it can occasionally express a strong desire or enthusiasm when paired with expressions like 「たい」 (want
  to) or 「ほしい」 (want). This pattern emphasizes a single factor as the direct and often decisive cause
  of a particular outcome. The underlying nuance of 「ばかりに」 stems from the idea of 'just this much' or
  'only this' being enough to lead to a significant, often surprising, result. This concept is connected
  to words like 「許す」 (yurusu), which implies 'allowing' or 'letting through' a minimum amount, leading
  to a consequence. This makes 「ばかりに」 suitable for situations where a small cause yields a disproportionate
  effect.

  - term: ばかり (only・excessive)
    meaning: Just, Only, Nothing but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ばかり」 also indicates something limited, it doesn't necessarily imply a cause-and-effect
      relationship or a nuance of regret like 「ばかりに」. It simply quantifies or limits.
    grammar_point: ばかり (only・just, often with nuance of excess)
  - term: からといって (just because)
    meaning: Just because
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「からといって」 is similar in meaning, but it is generally used to present a reason that is not necessarily
      valid or does not justify the outcome. 「ばかりに」 often suggests a more direct and perhaps regrettable
      consequence from a single, often insufficient, cause.
    grammar_point: からと言って・だからと言って (just because・even so)
  - term: につき (due to or per)
    meaning: Due to, On account of, Each or every
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「につき」 is used to state a reason, often in formal contexts, but it doesn't carry the same nuance
      of regret, unexpected consequence, or intense single-factor causation as 「ばかりに」. It's more of a
      neutral statement of cause.
    grammar_point: につき (due to or per)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate 「ばかりに」 from similar expressions, consider the specific context
  and nuance you want to convey. If you want to emphasize a direct and often regrettable cause-and-effect
  relationship stemming from a single, often insufficient, reason, 「ばかりに」 is the appropriate choice. If
  you simply want to state a reason without implying a specific consequence, 「につき」 might be more suitable,
  especially in formal settings. If you want to present a reason that may not be valid or doesn't justify
  the outcome, then use 「からといって」.

  in examples where a strong motivation leads to an action. The key is that a single, specific factor
  is presented as the determinant cause for the outcome, regardless of whether that outcome is positive
  or negative, though regret is a common nuance.
