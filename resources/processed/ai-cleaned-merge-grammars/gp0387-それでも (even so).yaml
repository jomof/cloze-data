    "etymology": "「それでも」 is a combination of 「それ」 (that) and 「でも」 (even). Literally, it means \"even with that.\" This origin highlights its core meaning of persistence or continuation despite a preceding condition or obstacle. The particle 「でも」 historically evolved from the conjunctive particle 「ても」 which conveys a concessive meaning (even if, even though), further cementing the idea of 'even so' or 'nevertheless' when combined with 「それ」 (that).",
    "writeup": "「それでも」 connects two phrases or sentences, A and B, to convey that despite the condition or information stated in A, B is still the case or will still happen. It inherently carries a nuance of **surprise or unexpectedness**, suggesting that the outcome in B occurs **even with** the preceding circumstance A. This makes it slightly different from a simple 'but' or 'however', as it emphasizes a situation where an action or state persists against expectations.While often translated as \"even so,\" \"nevertheless,\" or \"and yet,\" the literal sense, \"even with that,\" helps grasp its core meaning. It is used when a situation or feeling persists despite an opposing factor, or when a decision is made regardless of a difficulty.For instance, if it is raining (A), but one decides to go fishing anyway (B), 「それでも」 captures that persistence. It highlights the speaker's resolve or the surprising reality of B in the face of A. Unlike 「しかし」 or 「だが」, which simply introduce a contrast, 「それでも」 implies that the second clause holds true *despite* the implications of the first, often requiring a degree of effort or determination.",
