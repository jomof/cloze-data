    "etymology": "The word 「向き」 comes from the intransitive verb 「向く」 (muku), which means \"to face.\" Thus, 「向き」 retains the core meaning of direction or orientation. Its use as a suffix evolved to indicate suitability by implying that something naturally \"faces\" or is inclined towards a particular purpose or audience.",
    "writeup": "The noun 「向き」 (muki) is frequently used as a suffix in Japanese. It comes from the intransitive verb 「向く」 (muku), meaning \"to face.\" This word is often attached to the end of other nouns to show that something is \"facing (A)\" or \"suitable for (A).\" Because 「向き」 is intransitive, it usually implies that something is facing toward (A) naturally or by chance. Because of this, it conveys that something is \"suitable for (A)\", but not necessarily designed specifically for it.\n\nCaution: 「向け」 (muké), coming from the transitive verb 「向ける」 (mukeru), is used far more often to express that something has been specifically designed for (A).\n\nWhen comparing 「向き」 and 「向け」, the primary difference is that 「向き」 conveys that something is \"appropriate for (A)\", while 「向け」 is closer to \"intended for (A).\"",
