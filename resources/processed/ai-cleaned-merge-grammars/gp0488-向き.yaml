        "usage-context": "General",
        "function": "Indicates suitability or direction/orientation for something.",
        "nuance": "Implies a natural inclination or inherent appropriateness, often suggesting something is 'facing' or 'suited' to a situation by its nature or circumstances, rather than being intentionally designed or created for it. This contrasts with '向け', which implies specific design or intent.",
        "grammatical-role": "Used as a suffix to nouns to describe inherent qualities or direction.",

    },
    "etymology": "The word 「向き」 (muki) comes from the intransitive verb 「向く」 (muku), which means \"to face.\" Thus, 「向き」 retains the core meaning of direction or orientation. Its use as a suffix evolved to indicate suitability by implying that something naturally \"faces\" or is inclined towards a particular purpose or audience.",
    "writeup": "The noun 「向き」 (muki) is frequently used as a suffix in Japanese. It stems from the intransitive verb 「向く」 (muku), meaning \"to face.\" This usage allows it to indicate that something is \"facing (A)\" or is \"suitable for (A).\"\n\nSince 「向き」 is derived from an intransitive verb, it typically suggests that an item or situation is naturally oriented or suited to something, or that it became so by chance. This often conveys a sense of inherent appropriateness or a natural inclination, rather than a deliberate design.\n\nFor instance, saying 「子供向きの本」 (kodomo muki no hon) means \"a book suitable for children.\" This implies the book's content or style naturally fits children, not necessarily that it was specifically written for them (though it might have been). \n\n**Contrast with 向け (muké):**\nIt is crucial to distinguish 「向き」 from 「向け」 (muké). 「向け」 comes from the transitive verb 「向ける」 (mukeru), which means \"to turn something towards\" or \"to aim something at.\" Consequently, 「向け」 strongly implies that something was *specifically designed*, *intended for*, or *aimed at* a particular audience or purpose. For example, 「子供向けの本」 (kodomo muké no hon) would more strongly suggest \"a book intended/designed for children.\"\n\nIn summary, 「向き」 emphasizes natural suitability or orientation, while 「向け」 emphasizes specific design or intent.",
