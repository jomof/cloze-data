    "etymology": "「向き (muki)」 comes from the intransitive verb 「向く (muku)」, meaning \"to face.\" The noun form retains this sense of direction or orientation, but it also extends to suitability or aptitude.",
    "writeup": "「向き (muki)」 is a noun in Japanese frequently used as a suffix. It comes from the intransitive verb 「向く (muku)」, meaning \"to face.\" This word is often attached to the end of other nouns to show that something is \"facing (A)\" or \"suitable for (A).\" Because 「向き」 is intransitive, it usually implies that something faces toward (A) naturally or through chance. Because of this, it may convey that something is \"suitable for (A)\" but not necessarily designed specifically for it.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\n\n「向け (muke)」, coming from the transitive verb 「向ける (mukeru)」, is used far more often to express that something has been specifically designed for (A). When comparing 「向き」 and 「向け」, the primary difference is that 「向き」 conveys that something is \"appropriate for (A),\" while 「向け」 is closer to \"intended for (A).\"",
