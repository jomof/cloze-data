        "usage-context": "Used to introduce a hypothetical situation or a condition that is not necessarily true. Often used in formal settings, discussions, or when presenting arguments or thought experiments.",

    },
    "etymology": "The word 「仮に」 comes from 「仮」 (kari), meaning \"temporary\" or \"provisional,\" and 「に」 (ni), a particle. Together, they suggest something is being considered temporarily or provisionally, hence \"supposing that\" or \"for the sake of argument.\"",
    "writeup": "「仮に」 is an adverb used to introduce a hypothetical situation, a condition, or a supposition. It conveys a sense of \"suppose,\" \"assuming that,\" or \"even if\" in English. This expression is particularly common in formal settings, academic discussions, or when making arguments, as it frames a scenario for careful consideration or logical deduction.\n\nUnlike the more general conditional marker 「もし」, 「仮に」 introduces a hypothetical that is often more deliberate, a situation that one is proposing \"for the sake of argument\" or as a foundational premise for further discussion. It requires the listener or reader to seriously consider the proposed (and possibly untrue) situation.\n\n**Common Structures with 仮に**\n\n*   **仮に〜としたら / 仮に〜とすれば**: These structures are used to introduce a primary hypothetical condition, often when asking for a speculative outcome or consequence. For example, 「仮に宝くじが当たったとしたら、何をしますか。」(\"Supposing you won the lottery, what would you do?\").\n\n*   **仮に〜として**: This form is used to set up a premise or an assumption. It's akin to saying \"let's assume that\" or \"assuming it's true that.\" It's very common in logical arguments or when trying to explore the implications of a specific condition. For example, 「仮に彼が無実だとして、どうやって証明しますか。」(\"Assuming he is innocent, how will you prove it?\").\n\n*   **仮に〜場合**: This construction specifies a hypothetical case or scenario. It's similar to \"in the event that\" or \"if this were to happen.\" For example, 「仮に災害が発生した場合、どう行動すべきですか。」(\"In the event that a disaster occurs, how should we act?\").\n\n*   **仮に〜たら**: While 「たら」 is a general conditional, adding 「仮に」 emphasizes the deliberateness of the hypothetical. It makes the \"if\" clause more pronounced as a supposition rather than a simple conditional. For example, 「仮に明日晴れたら、ピクニックに行きましょう。」(\"Supposing it's sunny tomorrow, let's go for a picnic.\").\n\n*   **仮に〜ても / 仮に〜としても**: These forms express a concessive hypothetical, meaning \"even if\" or \"even supposing that.\" They imply that despite the hypothetical condition, a certain outcome or truth holds. For example, 「仮に失敗したとしても、経験は無駄になりません。」(\"Even if you fail, the experience won't be wasted.\"). This construction acknowledges the hypothetical possibility but asserts that something remains true regardless.",
