details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used to introduce a hypothetical situation or a condition that is not necessarily true.
    Often used in formal settings, discussions, or when presenting arguments or thought experiments.
  function: Introduces a conditional premise for consideration, often in formal or analytical contexts.
  nuance: Carries a stronger sense of deliberate supposition or a 'for the sake of argument' implication
    than simpler conditionals like 'もし'. It often sets up a more detailed or complex hypothetical scenario
    that requires careful consideration of its implications.
  grammatical-role: Functions as an adverbial phrase modifying the entire clause that follows, setting
    up the conditional context.
etymology: The word 「仮に」 comes from 「仮」 (kari), meaning "temporary" or "provisional," and 「に」 (ni), a
  particle. Together, they suggest something is being considered temporarily or provisionally, hence "supposing
  that" or "for the sake of argument."
writeup: |-
  「仮に」 is an adverb used to introduce a hypothetical situation, a condition, or a supposition. It conveys a sense of "suppose," "assuming that," or "even if" in English. This expression is particularly common in formal settings, academic discussions, or when making arguments, as it frames a scenario for careful consideration or logical deduction.

  Unlike the more general conditional marker 「もし」, 「仮に」 introduces a hypothetical that is often more deliberate, a situation that one is proposing "for the sake of argument" or as a foundational premise for further discussion. It requires the listener or reader to seriously consider the proposed (and possibly untrue) situation.

  **Common Structures with 仮に**

  *   **仮に〜としたら / 仮に〜とすれば**: These structures are used to introduce a primary hypothetical condition, often when asking for a speculative outcome or consequence. For example, 「仮に宝くじが当たったとしたら、何をしますか。」("Supposing you won the lottery, what would you do?").

  *   **仮に〜として**: This form is used to set up a premise or an assumption. It's akin to saying "let's assume that" or "assuming it's true that." It's very common in logical arguments or when trying to explore the implications of a specific condition. For example, 「仮に彼が無実だとして、どうやって証明しますか。」("Assuming he is innocent, how will you prove it?").

  *   **仮に〜場合**: This construction specifies a hypothetical case or scenario. It's similar to "in the event that" or "if this were to happen." For example, 「仮に災害が発生した場合、どう行動すべきですか。」("In the event that a disaster occurs, how should we act?").

  *   **仮に〜たら**: While 「たら」 is a general conditional, adding 「仮に」 emphasizes the deliberateness of the hypothetical. It makes the "if" clause more pronounced as a supposition rather than a simple conditional. For example, 「仮に明日晴れたら、ピクニックに行きましょう。」("Supposing it's sunny tomorrow, let's go for a picnic.").

  *   **仮に〜ても / 仮に〜としても**: These forms express a concessive hypothetical, meaning "even if" or "even supposing that." They imply that despite the hypothetical condition, a certain outcome or truth holds. For example, 「仮に失敗したとしても、経験は無駄になりません。」("Even if you fail, the experience won't be wasted."). This construction acknowledges the hypothetical possibility but asserts that something remains true regardless.
false_friends:
  - term: もし
    meaning: If
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「もし」 is a more general and widely used term for 'if' and can be used in a broader range of
      contexts, including casual conversation. 「仮に」 carries a stronger sense of deliberate hypothesis
      or a 'for the sake of argument' nuance, making it more suitable for formal or analytical discussions.
    grammar_point: もし (if for emphasis)
  - term: たとえ
    meaning: Even if; even though (often implying an extreme or unlikely hypothetical)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「たとえ」 also means 'even if', it often implies a more extreme or unlikely hypothetical
      situation, sometimes with a sense of concession or resignation. 「仮に」, on the other hand, sets up
      a premise for logical consideration or debate, regardless of how likely or unlikely the situation
      is. 「仮に」 introduces the hypothetical; 「たとえ」 often emphasizes the outcome despite the hypothetical.
    grammar_point: たとえ〜ても (even if)
  - term: にしても
    meaning: Even if
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「仮に」 often sets up a premise for a logical argument or detailed consideration of a hypothetical,
      「にしても」 often expresses a concession, meaning "even if this is true, then..." or "even if one assumes
      this, still...". It can also imply a sense of 'even if that's the case, it doesn't change much'.
      「仮に」 focuses more on the setting up of the hypothetical, while 「にしても」 is more about conceding a
      point.
    grammar_point: にしても (even if)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「もし」, 「たとえ」, and 「にしても」 all relate to conditional or concessive expressions,
  but their nuances differ from 「仮に」. 「もし」 is a general conditional for 'if', while 「仮に」 implies a more
  deliberate supposition or a hypothetical set up for discussion, often for logical argument or formal
  consideration. 「たとえ」 typically emphasizes the concessive nature, implying that something holds true
  *even if* a condition (often extreme) is met. On the other hand, 「にしても」 implies a concession, meaning
  'even if this is true, then...' or 'even if one assumes this, still...'. To avoid confusion, remember
  that 「仮に」 is about *setting up* a hypothetical scenario for analysis, while 「もし」 is a simple 'if', 「たとえ」
  focuses on the outcome *despite* an extreme hypothetical, and 「にしても」 often concedes a point.

post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, 「仮に」 serves to set up a scenario, whether for discussion,
  planning, or acknowledging a possibility. It invites a deeper consideration of the hypothetical than
  a simple conditional. Pay close attention to the particles and conjunctions that follow 「仮に」, as they
  determine the precise nuance—whether it's a direct supposition (としたら), an assumption (として), a specific
  case (場合), or a concession (ても/としても). Mastering its use allows for nuanced expression when presenting
  arguments, speculating, or setting conditions in various contexts.
