etymology: The grammar point 「なくなる」 is derived from the verb 「なくなる」 (nakunaru), meaning "to disappear"
  or "to be lost." In this grammatical construction, it retains the sense of something ceasing to exist
  or occur, but it's applied more broadly to states and actions, indicating a change from a previous condition.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「なくなる」 expresses that a certain state or action has ceased to exist or is no longer the case. It is a fundamental expression used to describe transitions where something that previously held true or occurred frequently has now stopped. This grammatical pattern emphasizes the **change** that led to the cessation.

  There are several ways to form 「なくなる」, depending on the type of word it follows:

  *   **Verb (plain negative form) + なる**: This indicates that an action or a state expressed by a verb has stopped occurring. For example, 「食べる」 (taberu) means "to eat" while 「食べなくなる」 (tabe naku naru) means "to stop eating" or "to no longer eat." It's often used with potential verbs, such as 「話せなくなる」 (hanase naku naru), meaning "to become unable to speak" or "to lose the ability to speak."
  *   **い-Adjective (stem) + くなくなる**: For い-adjectives, the final い is dropped, and 「くなくなる」 is appended. This signifies that the quality described by the adjective is no longer present. For instance, 「高くなくなる」 (takaku naku naru) means "to no longer be expensive."
  *   **な-Adjective (stem) + (では/じゃ)なくなる**: For な-adjectives, 「ではなくなる」 (or the more casual 「じゃなくなる」) is added. This indicates that the state described by the な-adjective is no longer true. For example, 「静かじゃなくなる」 (shizuka ja naku naru) means "to no longer be quiet."
  *   **Noun + (では/じゃ)なくなる**: Similarly, for nouns, 「ではなくなる」 (or 「じゃなくなる」) is used to express that someone or something is no longer identified as that noun. For example, 「学生じゃなくなる」 (gakusei ja naku naru) means "to no longer be a student."

  「なくなる」 implies a process or a gradual shift over time, leading to the current state of cessation. It's distinct from simply stating that something *is not* the case, as it highlights the **change** from a previous state of being or doing.
false_friends:
  - term: もう～ない
    meaning: not anymore
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「なくなる」 implies a change of state resulting in something no longer being the case, 「もう～ない」
      simply states that something is not the case anymore without necessarily implying a process of change.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:もう～ない (not anymore)
  - term: ようになる
    meaning: to become able to; to reach the point where
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「なくなる」, which describes the cessation of an action or state, 「ようになる」 describes the
      beginning or attainment of an ability or state.
    grammar_point: ようになる (to come to be)
  - term: ～ない
    meaning: not (plain negative)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「～ない」 simply states a current negative condition or absence, while 「～なくなる」 indicates a *change*
      from a state of being or doing to a state of not being or doing.
    grammar_point: Verb[ない] (plain negative)
  - term: ～ていない
    meaning: not doing; not in a state of
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「～ていない」 describes a current state of not performing an action or not being in a certain condition,
      whereas 「～なくなる」 emphasizes the process of *coming to be* in that state of non-action or non-existence.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:Verb[ていない] (not doing or not in a state of)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「なくなる」 focuses on the process or transition of something stopping, whereas
  「もう～ない」 is a direct statement about the current situation without emphasizing the change. 「ようになる」 indicates
  a gradual shift toward gaining the ability or condition to do something, in contrast to 「なくなる」, which
  signifies a shift away from a certain state. Simple negative forms like 「～ない」 or 「～ていない」 merely describe
  a present negative state or ongoing non-action, lacking the inherent meaning of transformation found
  in 「なくなる」.

    japanese:
      - 最近、夜 遅く まで 起き て いる こと が {なくなっ た}。
      - 最近、夜 遅く まで 起き て いる こと が {なくなり まし た}。
      - 最近、夜 遅く まで 起き {なくなっ た}。
      - 最近、夜更かし し {なくなっ た}。

        english: Recently, I am not staying up late at night.
        hint: 「～ていない」 describes a current state of not performing an action. We're looking for an expression
          that indicates a *change* from habitually doing something to not doing it.

        english: Recently, I no longer stay up late at night (simple statement).
        hint: 「もう～ない」 simply states that something is not the case anymore, without emphasizing a process

    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The phrase 「こと が なくなった」 is used here to emphasize the *occurrence* of an action ceasing, rather
      than the action itself. The speaker's reflection on a personal habit makes the casual register and
      younger age appropriate for a personal thought or diary entry. The speaker's gender isn't specifically
      marked but is a common neutral choice for such reflective statements.

      (～ました) are appropriate for an older male real estate agent addressing potential renters.
