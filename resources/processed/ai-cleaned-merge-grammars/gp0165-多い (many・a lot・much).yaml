jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: adjective
  register: teineigo (polite)
  function: Describes quantity or frequency.
  nuance: Indicates a large quantity or high frequency, generally objective but can also be subjective.
  grammatical-role: predicate or noun modifier
etymology: The word 「多い」 (おおい) originates from Old Japanese. Its root 「おお」 (ō) is related to concepts
  of 'large' or 'numerous'. As an い-adjective, its structure is consistent with historical adjectival
  forms in Japanese, reflecting a long-standing use to denote abundance.
writeup: 「多い」 (おおい) is an い-adjective meaning "many," "a lot," or "much." It is used to describe a large
  quantity or high frequency of something. Like other い-adjectives, it can directly modify a noun (e.g.,
  「多い人」 - many people) or act as a predicate at the end of a sentence (e.g., 「人が多い」 - There are many people).%When
  used with nouns, 「多い」 can apply to both countable nouns (e.g., 「学生が多い」 - many students) and uncountable
  nouns (e.g., 「水が多い」 - much water), depending on the context.%When describing frequency, 「多い」 is often
  paired with the nominalizer 「こと」 (koto) and a verb to indicate that an action happens often. For instance,
  「食べる ことが 多い」 (taberu koto ga ooi) means "I eat often" or "It is often the case that I eat."%While generally
  objective, 「多い」 can also convey a subjective sense of "too many" or "more than expected" depending on
  intonation and context, though it's less direct than using specific intensifiers.
false_friends:
  - term: たくさん
    meaning: a lot, many, much
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「たくさん」 is an adverbial noun and can modify verbs or nouns (with の). It feels more conversational
      and less formal than 「多い」 when modifying nouns (e.g., 「たくさんの人」 vs. 「多い人」). 「たくさん」 also works more
      easily with verbs to mean "do a lot." 「多い」 specifically describes the quantity of the subject/object
      or the frequency of an action.
    grammar_point: たくさん (many・a lot)
  - term: 少ない (few・little)
    meaning: few, little
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「少ない」 is the direct opposite of 「多い」, meaning "few" or "little." It indicates a small quantity
      or low frequency.
    grammar_point: 少ない (few・little)
  - term: ばかり (only・excessive)
    meaning: nothing but, full of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ばかり」 can also imply "many" or "a lot" in the sense of "nothing but" or "full of," but it
      often carries a negative or restrictive nuance. For example, 「文句 ばかりだ」 (monku bakari da) means "It's
      nothing but complaints" or "There are only complaints," suggesting an excessive and often undesirable
      amount. 「多い」 is more neutral and simply states a large quantity.
    grammar_point: ばかり (only・just, often with nuance of excess)
  - term: すぎる (too much・excessive)
    meaning: too much, excessive
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「すぎる」 implies an excessive degree, often with a negative connotation, meaning "too much" or
      "too many." For example, 「人が多すぎる」 (hito ga ooisugiru) means "There are too many people." While 「多い」
      just states "many," 「すぎる」 adds the judgmental idea of "excessiveness."
    grammar_point: すぎる (too much・excessive)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「多い」 directly states a large quantity or frequency, 「たくさん」 often emphasizes
  the *amount* or *degree* of something, and can act as an adverb for actions. 「少ない」 is its direct opposite.
  Expressions like 「ばかり」 and 「すぎる」 also relate to quantity but introduce additional nuances of restriction,
  "nothing but," or "excessiveness," respectively. Understanding these subtle differences helps in choosing
  the most appropriate word for the desired emphasis and nuance.
examples:
  - english: There are many students in this class.
    japanese:
      - この クラス は 学生 が {多い} です。
      - この クラス は 学生 が {多い}。
    english_literally: This class, students are many.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この クラス は 学生 が {たくさん} い ます。
        english: This class has many students.
        hint: 「たくさん」 is an adverbial noun meaning "a lot," which can be used similarly to describe quantity.
          However, 「多い」 is an い-adjective directly describing the noun's quantity as a characteristic.
          We're looking for an adjective use.

        english: I often eat outside.
        hint: 「よくあります」 means "it often happens," focusing more on the adverbial sense of "often" rather
          than the adjective "many" describing frequency of an event. We're looking for an expression
          that treats the occurrence as a quantity.

        english: My cat is always just sleeping.
        hint: 「ばかりいる」 implies that the cat is *only* sleeping, often with a slight nuance of "all the
          time" or "excessively." While it conveys frequency, it adds a restrictive element that 「ことが多い」
          does not. We're looking for a neutral statement of high frequency.

          simply states "many" without that judgment. We're looking for a neutral statement of quantity.

          - この 地域 は 蚊 ばかり だ。
        english: This area is nothing but mosquitoes.
        hint: 「ばかりだ」 emphasizes that there's *only* that thing, often with a negative connotation of annoyance
          or overabundance, which is stronger than simply stating "there are many." We're looking for
          a phrase that expresses "many" neutrally.

          the *quantity of occurrences*.

        hint: 「ばっかり」 (a casual form of ばかり) implies doing *nothing but* overtime, highlighting the restrictive
          and perhaps monotonous nature of the action. 「ことが多い」 simply states that it happens frequently.
          We're looking for a neutral expression of frequency.

    scene: A woman confiding in a friend.
    register: casual

      a personal feeling.
post_example_writeup: These examples demonstrate how 「多い」 is used to convey a sense of abundance or frequency,
  either modifying nouns directly or in conjunction with 「こと」 to describe recurring actions. Paying attention
  to the context and surrounding particles helps to distinguish its meaning and nuance from similar expressions.
