jlpt: N2
details:
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used in formal or stiff contexts, often conveying a sense of difficulty or impossibility.
  grammatical-role: auxiliary verb
etymology: The verb 「兼 (か)ねる」 means "to combine," "to do two things at once," or "to serve two purposes."
  When used as a suffix, it implies that doing something is difficult because it interferes with another
  obligation or conflicts with one's desires.
writeup: 「かねる」, typically written in kana, attaches to the ます-stem of a verb. It indicates that it is
  **difficult, impossible, or one is hesitant to do something**, often due to external circumstances or
  conflicting desires. While 「できない」 also means "cannot", 「かねる」 is more formal and implies a sense of regret
  or reluctance. It suggests that performing the action would be "a stretch" of one's ability or capacity.
  This grammar point is commonly used in formal or stiff contexts where a direct refusal might be considered
  too strong.

  - term: かねない
    meaning: Might, could be, capable of, possible

    grammar_point: かねない (might・could)
  - term: 得ない
    meaning: Unable to, cannot
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「〜得ない」 (enai) emphasizes logical impossibility or complete inability, whereas 「かねる」 highlights
      difficulty or reluctance.
    grammar_point: 得ない (cannot・impossible)
  - term: わけにはいかない
    meaning: Cannot afford to, no way, impossible to do
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「わけにはいかない」 implies a stronger sense of obligation or social pressure preventing an action,
      unlike the milder reluctance suggested by 「かねる」.
    grammar_point: わけにはいかない (cannot afford to)
  - term: 切れない
    meaning: Unable to finish or complete
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「切れない」 refers specifically to the inability to finish something due to exhaustion or capacity,
      while 「かねる」 expresses a broader difficulty or reluctance.
    grammar_point: 切れない (unable to finish fully)
  - term: を兼ねて
    meaning: To serve multiple purposes
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「を兼ねて」 describes something serving multiple purposes, unlike 「かねる」 which expresses inability
      or reluctance.
    grammar_point: を兼ねて (to serve multiple purposes)
  - term: できない
    meaning: Cannot; unable to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「かねる」 is more formal and implies difficulty or hesitation due to circumstances or internal
      conflict, whereas 「できない」 is a straightforward statement of inability.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:できない (cannot do)
  - term: がたい
    meaning: Hard to, difficult to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both convey difficulty, 「かねる」 often implies a nuance of personal hesitation or a formal
      refusal due to external circumstances, whereas 「がたい」 generally signifies inherent difficulty in
      performing the action.
    grammar_point: がたい (hard to do)
  - term: まい
    meaning: Won't, intend not to, probably not
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「まい」 expresses strong negative intent or a high probability of not doing something, often
      due to personal decision, contrasting with 「かねる」's nuance of difficulty or reluctance driven by
      external factors or conflict.
    grammar_point: まい (won't・probably not)
  - term: ずにはいられない
    meaning: Cannot help doing something, cannot resist doing something
    kind: antonym
    nuance: While 「かねる」 implies inability or reluctance to perform an action, 「ずにはいられない」 expresses an
      uncontrollable compulsion to perform an action, presenting an opposite dynamic.
    grammar_point: ずにはいられない (cannot help but do)
post_false_friends_writeup: The key to differentiating 「かねる」 from similar expressions lies in understanding
  the nuance of reluctance and difficulty it conveys. While other phrases may express inability or impossibility,
  「かねる」 subtly suggests a desire or willingness that is overridden by circumstance. The important thing
  to remember about 「かねる」 is that it expresses reluctance, and that it is a formal construction. Pay attention
  to the surrounding context to understand the underlying reasons behind the inability and the degree
  of formality required.

      situation and his own internal difficulty, suggesting it's not a simple lack of ability but a challenge
      to overcome.

      refusal is based on formal procedure or confidentiality rather than personal unwillingness, which
      is crucial in a professional setting.

      emphasize the sheer irrationality of the situation.
