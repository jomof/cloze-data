        "function": "To express the act of becoming aware of something through observation or perception, often subtly.",
        "nuance": "Implies a shift in awareness or perception, where one's attention ('気') becomes 'attached' to something. It often conveys a more subtle or unconscious process of noticing compared to actively looking for something.",
        "grammatical-role": "The particle に marks the object of noticing or the specific thing that one becomes aware of."
    },
    "etymology": "The expression 「に気がつく」 combines the particle 「に」, the noun 「気」 (ki, meaning spirit, mind, or attention), and the verb 「付く」 (tsuku, meaning to attach or adhere). The phrase literally translates to \"attention attaches to,\" indicating a shift in awareness or realization.",
    "writeup": "「に気がつく」 is a common Japanese expression used to describe the act of **noticing** or **realizing** something. It highlights a moment when one's awareness or attention shifts to become aware of a particular detail, fact, or situation. The verb 「付く」 (tsuku) means \"to be attached,\" and in this phrase, it is intransitive, indicating that the noticing occurs naturally or by itself, rather than through an active effort of searching.\n\nThe particle 「に」 functions as a case marker, indicating the 'location' or target to which one's 「気」 (ki), or attention, becomes attached. This structure allows the grammar point to be used after nouns (e.g., 「彼の変な顔**に気がついた**」 - \"I noticed his strange expression\") or after verbs that have been nominalized using 「の」 or 「こと」 (e.g., 「雪が降っている**ことに気がついた**」 - \"I realized it was snowing\").\n\nThe concept of 「気」 is multifaceted in Japanese, encompassing meanings such as 'spirit', 'attention', 'will', or 'consciousness'. In the context of 「に気がつく」, 「気」 can be best understood as one's 'presence of mind' or 'perception'. The location to which this focus or perception is drawn is always marked by 「に」, signifying the point of awareness. This phrase is widely used across various registers, from casual conversation to more formal settings, depending on the conjugation and context.",

        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「気づかい」 shares the element 「気」, meaning 'spirit' or 'mind', its focus is on the act of showing consideration or concern for others. This is distinct from 「に気がつく」, which is about one's own perception or realization of a fact or situation. To avoid confusion, remember that 「に気がつく」 is a verb phrase indicating a shift in awareness, while 「気づかい」 is a noun referring to thoughtfulness or worry.",
