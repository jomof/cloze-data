        "nuance": "The meaning of てくる often depends on the type of verb it attaches to. For verbs of movement, it implies coming. For verbs of change, it implies a process unfolding over time up to the present. For actions, it can imply continuation or return."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てくる」 is a compound form, combining the te-form of a verb with the verb 来る (くる), meaning \"to come.\" The te-form serves to connect verbs, indicating a sequence of actions or a preceding state. In this construction, 来る adds a directional or temporal nuance. Historically, this combination evolved to describe an action that moves towards the speaker or a state that develops and approaches the present moment. It implies a trajectory from a point in the past or a distant location to the present moment or the speaker's location.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point **てくる** functions as an auxiliary verb, attaching to the te-form of another verb. It primarily conveys three core meanings:\n\n1.  **Movement towards the speaker**: When combined with verbs of movement, **てくる** indicates that an action is performed, and then the subject moves towards the speaker or a reference point. For example, 「持って来る (motte kuru)」 means \"to bring (something)\" (literally, \"to hold and come\"), implying movement towards the speaker.\n\n2.  **Gradual change or process from past to present**: This is a very common usage where **てくる** signifies that a state or action has been developing or progressing over time, leading up to the present moment. It implies a continuous or gradual change. For instance, 「暖かくなって来た (atatakaku natte kita)」 means \"it has become warm (gradually, over time).\"\n\n3.  **Completion of an action with implied return**: In specific contexts, particularly with verbs like 行く (iku, to go), **てくる** forms expressions like 「行って来る (itte kuru)」, which means \"to go and come back.\" This implies that the action (going) is performed, and a return to the original location or speaker is expected.\n\nIt is important to differentiate **てくる** from its counterpart **ていく**. While **てくる** describes movement or change towards the speaker or the present, **ていく** generally describes movement or change away from the speaker or progressing into the future. The specific nuance of **てくる** is determined by the main verb it attaches to and the context of the sentence. While the kanji 来る is often used for the literal \"come\" meaning, the hiragana くる is frequently seen in the grammatical auxiliary sense, especially for changes over time.",

This is a common way for male speakers to express emergent or developing emotions in a casual context, highlighting the subtle, progressive nature of the feeling. The male speech particle 「僕」 is used here.",

This reflects 「くる」's inherent meaning of 'coming' or 'approaching', applied to an internal state or emotion."
