    "etymology": "「てくる」 is formed by combining the te-form of a verb with the verb 「来る (くる)」, meaning \"to come.\" The te-form indicates a state or a continuing action, and 「来る」 adds the nuance of something approaching or emerging over time. Thus, 「てくる」 describes a process or change that has been happening and continues to develop.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「てくる」 combines the te-form of a verb with 「来る (kuru)」. It expresses nuances such as \"something has come to be,\" \"something is starting to happen,\" or \"something has been continuing.\"  It can refer to both physical movement (\"to come\") and changes over time (\"to become\").\n\n**Key uses:**\n\n*   **Change over time:**  Indicates something has started or is in the process of becoming something else. This is the most common usage.\n*   **Continuation of an action:** Shows that an action has been happening from the past until now. \n*   **Return:** Shows that someone will go and return from a certain place. \n\nThis is opposite of 「ていく」 which we will cover in a later lesson.",
