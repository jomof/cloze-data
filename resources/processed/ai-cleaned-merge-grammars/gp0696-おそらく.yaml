    "writeup": "「おそらく」 is an adverb that originally stems from the conjugation of the *yodan* verb 「恐る」 \"to fear.\" In most cases, 「おそらく」 is used as a formal way to say \"probably\" or \"perhaps\" and is usually partnered with other structures of conjecture, such as 「だろう」 or 「かもしれない」. As 「おそらく」 behaves adverbially, it will most often appear at the beginning of sentences before a statement of conjecture is made.\n\nAlthough 「おそらく」 can, and often does, carry the meaning of \"I fear that (A),\" it isn't necessarily always used in relation to negative things. In the case of this grammar point, the main nuance that \"I fear that (A)\" conveys is modesty on behalf of the speaker in that they fear their assumption may be right, given the available information.\n\n**Important Note:** *Yodan* or 四段活用verbs are a type of classical-Japanese verb that have primarily been replaced by *godan* (う-Verbs) in modern Japanese.",
    "etymology": "The term 「おそらく」 comes from the verb 「恐る」 (*osoru*) which means \"to fear\". It implies a sense of caution or consideration before making a statement, hence the meaning of \"probably\" or \"perhaps.\"",
