    "etymology": "「おそらく」 originates from the verb 「恐る」 (osoru), meaning \"to fear.\" The adverbial form retains a nuance of apprehension or uncertainty, though it primarily functions as a formal equivalent of \"probably.\" This linguistic evolution highlights how expressions of fear or caution can become markers of a high degree of probability, especially in more formal contexts.",
    "writeup": "「おそらく」 is an adverb that conveys a high degree of probability or possibility. While it is derived from the verb 「恐る」 (\"to fear\"), in modern Japanese, it is generally used as a more formal way of saying \"probably\" or \"perhaps.\" It frequently appears alongside other expressions of conjecture, such as 「だろう」, 「でしょう」, or 「かもしれない」.\n\nAs an adverb, 「おそらく」 typically appears at the beginning of a sentence or phrase, preceding the statement of conjecture. Although it can sometimes carry the nuance of \"I fear that (A),\" this specific apprehension is not always present. When it *does* convey this meaning, it often implies a sense of modesty on the speaker's part, suggesting a hesitation to assert their assumption as absolutely correct, even when the available information strongly supports it. This subtle nuance adds a layer of politeness or cautiousness to the statement.",

            "nuance": "「たぶん」 also means 'probably', but it is considerably less formal than 「おそらく」. While both convey a high probability, 「たぶん」 is common in casual conversation, whereas 「おそらく」 is reserved for more formal or written contexts."
