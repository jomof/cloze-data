    "etymology": "「おそらく」 originates from the verb 「恐る」 (osoru), meaning \"to fear.\" The adverbial form retains a nuance of apprehension or uncertainty, though it primarily functions as a formal equivalent of \"probably.\"",
    "writeup": "「おそらく」 is an adverb that conveys a high degree of probability or possibility. While derived from the verb 「恐る」 (\"to fear\"), it's generally used as a more formal way of saying \"probably\" or \"perhaps.\" It often accompanies other expressions of conjecture, such as 「だろう」 or 「かもしれない」.\n\nBecause 「おそらく」 functions as an adverb, it typically appears at the beginning of a sentence, preceding the statement of conjecture. Although it can sometimes carry the nuance of \"I fear that (A)\", this isn't always the case. When it *does* convey this meaning, it implies a sense of modesty on the speaker's part, suggesting they are hesitant to assert their assumption is correct, even with the available information.",
