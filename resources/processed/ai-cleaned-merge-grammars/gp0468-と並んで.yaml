    "etymology": "This grammar point comes from the verb 並ぶ (narabu), meaning \"to line up\" or \"to stand in a row.\" The use of 「と」 here indicates comparison or togetherness, so 「と並んで」 literally means \"lined up with\" or \"standing alongside,\" and thus it has come to mean \"comparable to\" or \"along with.\"",
    "writeup": "「と並んで」 (to narande) is used to express that something is comparable to or on par with something else. It indicates that two things are at the same level in terms of popularity, quality, or another attribute. It is often translated as \"in line with,\" \"comparable with,\" \"along with,\" \"just like,\" or \"as…as.\" It's considered a relatively formal expression.",
