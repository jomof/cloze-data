    "writeup": "The grammar point 「と並んで」 (to narande) expresses the idea that something is comparable to something else, \"in line with,\" or \"along with\" another item. It is often used in formal contexts (硬い). It's derived from the verb 「並ぶ」 (narabu), meaning \"to line up\" or \"to be comparable.\" The 「と」 particle indicates comparison. 「と並んで」 is usually preceded by nouns or noun phrases, highlighting that the subjects are on par with each other.",
    "etymology": "「と並んで」 is derived from the verb 「並ぶ」(narabu, to line up, to be comparable) in its te-form, 「並んで」(narande), combined with the particle 「と」(to). The 「と」 particle indicates a comparison or listing of items. Thus, 「と並んで」 literally means 'lining up with,' but figuratively, it means 'being comparable to' or 'in line with'.",

And use 「に伴って」 to show that one thing is causing another or happening at the same time due to a specific reason. 「と並んで」 is specifically for showing that two or more things are at the same level of something, such as popularity or value."
