    "etymology": "This grammar point comes from the verb 並ぶ (narabu), meaning \"to line up\" or \"to stand in a row.\" The use of 「と」 here indicates comparison or togetherness, so 「と並んで」 literally means \"lined up with\" or \"standing alongside,\" and thus it has come to mean \"comparable to\" or \"along with.\"",
    "writeup": "「と並んで」 (to narande) is a grammatical construction often used to express that something is comparable to, or on par with, something else. It signifies that two entities stand at an equivalent level in terms of quality, popularity, achievement, or any other attribute. This expression is derived from the verb 並ぶ (narabu), meaning \"to line up\" or \"to stand in a row,\" and the particle と (to) indicating association or comparison.\n\nWhile typically found in its te-form, 「並んで」, the plain form 「並ぶ」 can also be used, particularly when followed by ほど (hodo), to emphasize the *degree* to which something is comparable. For instance, 「AはBと並ぶほどCだ」 conveys that \"A is C to the extent that it's comparable to B.\" This construction is generally considered a relatively formal expression, often described as 「硬い」 (katai), meaning stiff or rigid in usage.",
