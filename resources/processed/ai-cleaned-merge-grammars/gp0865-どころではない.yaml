    "etymology": "The grammar point 「どころではない」 is derived from 「所 (tokoro)」, which originally refers to 'place' but also commonly signifies 'situation' or 'circumstance'. When combined with 「ではない (de wa nai)」, the negative form of the copula 「だ」, it creates a nuanced expression. The literal interpretation might be 'it is not the place for (something),' which has evolved to mean that the current circumstances are so severe or demanding that a certain action or state is entirely inappropriate, impossible, or an extreme understatement.",
    "writeup": "The phrase 「どころではない」 expresses that something is 'far from' a certain state or that a certain action is 'out of the question.' It highlights a situation where something is impossible or inappropriate due to the current circumstances. This grammar point conveys two primary nuances:\n\n1.  **Far from / Out of the question**: This usage indicates that the actual situation is far more serious or extreme than the phrase it is attached to. For example, if someone says 「悲しいどころではない」, it implies the situation is beyond mere sadness, perhaps devastating.\n\n2.  **Not the time for**: This usage implies that a particular action or consideration is entirely unsuitable or impossible due to more pressing or critical matters. It often reflects the speaker's strong personal opinion or judgment that something is not permissible given the current priorities.\n\n「どころではない」 is typically used at the end of a phrase. In more casual settings, 「ではない」 can be replaced with 「じゃない」. It's a versatile expression to emphasize the severity of a situation or the inappropriateness of an action.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「どころではない」, 「ものか」 often carries a stronger sense of defiance, disbelief, or strong negative assertion, often used in exclamatory sentences."

            "meaning": "Far from, Anything but",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「どころではない」, 「どころか」 implies a greater difference or escalation. It is used to present a situation that is the opposite or far more extreme than what might be expected."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「ものか」 and 「どころか」 share some semantic overlap with 「どころではない」, they convey distinct nuances. 「ものか」 is for strong, often defiant, negative assertions. 「どころか」 is used to express that something is not just not the case, but quite the opposite or even more extreme. 「どころではない」, on the other hand, emphasizes that an action or state is unsuitable or impossible due to overwhelming circumstances or a more pressing matter.",

            "nuance": "The use of 「なんて」 in the casual forms emphasizes the speaker's strong feeling that eating is utterly inappropriate given the pressing deadline. The slight variations in phrasing reflect common ways to express this sentiment in Japanese.",
            "etymology": "The expression '差し迫る' (sashisemaru) for 'fast approaching' or 'imminent' literally means 'to approach closely and pressingly,' conveying a strong sense of urgency."

            "nuance": "The phrase 「試験 直前」 (shiken chokuzen) highlights the immediate proximity to the exam, intensifying the sense of inappropriateness for playing. The inclusion of 「よ」 at the end adds a soft but firm assertion, typical in casual explanations.",
            "etymology": "「直前」 (chokuzen) means 'immediately before,' formed from 「直」 (choku, direct/straight) and 「前」 (zen, before), emphasizing the direct preceding moment."

            "etymology": "The auxiliary verb 「失う」 (ushinau, to lose) has roots in classical Japanese, indicating a state of being deprived of something, often with a sense of regret or misfortune."

            "etymology": "「全く」 (mattaku) and 「全然」 (zenzen) are adverbs that intensify negation. 「全く」 historically conveyed 'wholly' or 'entirely,' evolving to emphasize 'not at all' when used with negatives. 「全然」 likewise means 'entirely' and is almost exclusively used with negative verbs in modern Japanese to mean 'not at all'."

The phrasing 「できる はずがない」 indicates a strong conviction that something is impossible or out of the question.",
