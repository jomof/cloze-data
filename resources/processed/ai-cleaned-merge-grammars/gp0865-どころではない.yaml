    "etymology": "The grammar point 「どころではない」 is derived from 「所 (tokoro)」 meaning 'place' or 'situation.' When combined with 「ではない (de wa nai)」, it creates the sense that the current situation is so far removed from a certain state or action that it is impossible or inappropriate.",
    "writeup": "The phrase 「どころではない」 expresses that something is 'far from' a certain state or that a certain action is 'out of the question.' It highlights a situation where something is impossible or inappropriate due to the current circumstances. It often translates to \"this is not the time for...\" or \"it's out of the question\". 「ではない」 can be replaced with 「じゃない」 in casual speech. This grammar point reflects the speaker's opinion on a situation deemed far more important or pressing than the one being discussed.",
