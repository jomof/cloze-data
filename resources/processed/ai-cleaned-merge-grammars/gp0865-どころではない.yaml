    "etymology": "The grammar point 「どころではない」 is derived from 「所 (tokoro)」, which originally refers to 'place' but also commonly signifies 'situation' or 'circumstance'. When combined with 「ではない (de wa nai)」, the negative form of the copula 「だ」, it creates a nuanced expression. The literal interpretation might be 'it is not the place for (something),' which has evolved to mean that the current circumstances are so severe or demanding that a certain action or state is entirely inappropriate, impossible, or an extreme understatement.",
    "writeup": "The phrase 「どころではない」 expresses that something is 'far from' a certain state or that a certain action is 'out of the question.' It highlights a situation where something is impossible or inappropriate due to the current circumstances. This grammar point conveys two primary nuances:\n\n1.  **Far from / Out of the question**: This usage indicates that the actual situation is far more serious or extreme than the phrase it is attached to. For example, if someone says 「悲しいどころではない」, it implies the situation is beyond mere sadness, perhaps devastating.\n\n2.  **Not the time for**: This usage implies that a particular action or consideration is entirely unsuitable or impossible due to more pressing or critical matters. It often reflects the speaker's strong personal opinion or judgment that something is not permissible given the current priorities.\n\n「どころではない」 is typically used at the end of a phrase. In more casual settings, 「ではない」 can be replaced with 「じゃない」. It's a versatile expression to emphasize the severity of a situation or the inappropriateness of an action.",
