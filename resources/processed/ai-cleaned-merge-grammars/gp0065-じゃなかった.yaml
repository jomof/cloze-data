    "etymology": "「じゃなかった」 is the casual past negative form derived from the copula 「だ」. Historically, 「だ」 is believed to have originated from 「である」, which further simplified to 「ではある」 in the negative. The contraction 「では」 to 「じゃ」 became common in spoken Japanese. Thus, 「じゃなかった」 is the past negative of this contracted form, equivalent to 「ではなかった」 but conveying a more informal tone.",
    "writeup": "「じゃなかった」 is the casual past negative form of the copula 「だ」. It is used to negate nouns and な-adjectives in the past tense, meaning 'was not' or 'wasn't'. The 「じゃ」 part is a contraction of 「では」, making 「じゃなかった」 a more informal and commonly used alternative to 「ではなかった」 in everyday conversation.To form the past negative with 「じゃなかった」, simply attach it directly to the noun or the stem of a な-adjective. For example, to say 'it wasn't a cat', you would use 「猫じゃなかった」 (neko janakatta). For a な-adjective like 「静か」 (shizuka, quiet), 'it wasn't quiet' becomes 「静かじゃなかった」 (shizuka janakatta).While 「じゃなかった」 is firmly in the casual register, Japanese offers more formal options depending on the context and your relationship with the listener: ではなかった: This form is slightly more formal than 「じゃなかった」. It retains the 「では」 and is often preferred in written contexts or more reserved spoken situations. じゃありませんでした: This is the fully polite form. It combines the polite negative present 「じゃありません」 with the polite past auxiliary 「でした」. This form is suitable for formal conversations, business settings, or when addressing someone of higher status.Understanding and appropriately using these variations is crucial for natural and effective communication in Japanese. The choice of form reflects the speaker's deference and the overall formality of the interaction.",
