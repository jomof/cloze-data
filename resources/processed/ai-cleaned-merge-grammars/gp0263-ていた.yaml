    "writeup": "「ていた」 is used to describe an action that was in progress at a specific time in the past, or a state that existed in the past. It's equivalent to the English \"was doing\". The polite form is 「ていました」, and the negative forms are 「ていなかった」 and 「ていませんでした」. It's useful for describing ongoing actions, habitual actions in the past, or states that existed previously.",
