        "source": "general Japanese grammar"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ていた」 is derived from the 「て」-form of a verb combined with the past tense of the auxiliary verb 「いる」. 「いる」 originally means \"to exist (animate)\" or \"to be\". The combination of the te-form and 「いる」 evolved to express ongoing actions and states, and its past tense form 「いた」 naturally extended this meaning to the past.",
    "writeup": "The grammatical construction 「ていた」 (or its polite form 「ていました」) is used to convey that an action was in progress or that a certain state existed at a specific point in the past. It functions similarly to the English \"was doing\" or \"used to be\". This structure is formed by taking the te-form of a verb and appending the past tense of the verb 「いる」 (to exist/be). It highlights the continuous or durative aspect of an action or the sustained nature of a state in the past.\n\n**Common Uses:**\n*   **Ongoing action in the past:** Describing what someone was doing at a particular past moment. For example, 「彼 は 本 を 読ん でいた」 (Kare wa hon o yonde ita) means \"He was reading a book.\"\n*   **Continuous state in the past:** Describing a state that existed and continued over a period in the past. For example, 「窓 が 開い ていた」 (Mado ga aite ita) means \"The window was open (and remained open).\"\n*   **Habitual action in the past:** Describing something that regularly happened in the past. For example, 「昔 は よく 公園 で 遊ん でいた」 (Mukashi wa yoku kōen de asonde ita) means \"I used to play in the park often.\"\n\n**Important Considerations:**\nWhile 「ていた」 primarily indicates a past continuous action or state, it can also imply that an action was in progress up to a certain point and then ceased or continued, or that a state was established and then persisted. For instance, 「お父さん が その 椅子 に 座っ ていた」 (Otōsan ga sono isu ni suwatte ita) could mean \"Dad was sitting in that chair (and might still be, or just left)\", depending on context and the speaker's knowledge. This nuance is crucial when distinguishing it from a simple past tense verb.",
