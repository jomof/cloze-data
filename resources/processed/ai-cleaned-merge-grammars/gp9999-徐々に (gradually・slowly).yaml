learn_before:
  - い-Adjective[く] (adverbial form)
  - ときいた (I heard that)
id: gp9999
meaning: gradually; slowly
pronunciation:
  katakana: ジョジョニ
  romaji: jojo ni
formation:
  徐々に + Verb: Modifies the verb to indicate that the action happens gradually.
  徐々に + Change Verb (なる・変わる): Emphasizes a slow, steady transformation.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The word 徐々に (jojo ni) is derived from 徐々 (jojo), which is a reduplication of 徐 (jo), meaning
  "slowly" or "gently." The particle に (ni) here functions to turn the adverbial noun into an adverb modifying
  verbs or adjectives. This reduplication emphasizes the continuous, steady, and unhurried nature of the
  progression.
writeup: 徐々に (jojo ni) is an adverb used to describe a slow, gradual, and continuous change or progression.
  It implies that something is happening little by little, almost imperceptibly, rather than abruptly.
  This adverb is often paired with verbs that express change, such as 変わる (kawaru - to change), 進む (susumu
  - to advance), or 増える (fueru - to increase). While だんだん (dandan) also means "gradually," 徐々に often carries
  a slightly more formal or literary nuance. It can also imply a more controlled or intentional process
  of gradualness, whereas だんだん is often used for natural, spontaneous changes. Think of 徐々に as a steady,
  measured pace, like a slow ascent or a gentle fading. It is suitable for describing both physical and
  abstract changes.

  - term: 少しずつ
    meaning: little by little; bit by bit
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 少しずつ emphasizes the small, discrete increments of change. While it also implies gradualness,
      the focus is on the size of each step, making the process feel more deliberate.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:少しずつ (little by little)
  - term: ゆっくり
    meaning: slowly; leisurely; at ease
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ゆっくり primarily describes the speed of an action, not necessarily a change over time. It can
      also mean 'at ease' or 'relaxedly,' and does not imply incremental change.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ゆっくり (slowly)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 徐々に, だんだん, 少しずつ, and ゆっくり can all be translated as 'gradually' or 'slowly'
  in English, their nuances differ. 徐々に implies a smooth, continuous, and often subtle progression. だんだん
  suggests a more spontaneous and noticeable increase or decrease over time. 少しずつ emphasizes the discrete,
  small steps taken in a process. ゆっくり simply describes the pace of an action as slow, without necessarily
  implying change or incremental progress.

  *uninterrupted continuity* of the change itself.
