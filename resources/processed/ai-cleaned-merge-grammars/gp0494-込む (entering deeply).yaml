    "writeup": "The verb 「込む」 (komu) is primarily used as a suffix attached to the masu-stem of other verbs. It indicates that an action is performed 'into' something, conveying a sense of complete or thorough entry. This can be interpreted both literally, as physically entering a space, or figuratively, as delving deeply into a state or activity. This grammar point focuses on the core meaning of 'to put into (A)' or 'to go into (A)', where 'A' is the action indicated by the preceding verb. The nuance often implies that the entry is not necessarily easy, and once an action or state is 'entered into' with 「込む」, it signifies a deep or committed engagement. Think of it as 'jamming (B) into (A)', suggesting a full and often irreversible integration.",

Similarly, 「書く」 is to write, but 「書き込む」 specifically means to write *into* a document. 「出す」 means to take out, while 「出し込む」 implies bringing contributions into a shared space. Other verbs like 「抱える」 (to hold) and 「始める」 (to begin) are more general than their 「～込む」 counterparts (「抱え込む」 for deep internalization, 「取り組む」 for serious engagement). And finally, 「多い」 (many) describes quantity, whereas 「詰め込まれる」 suggests being densely packed.
