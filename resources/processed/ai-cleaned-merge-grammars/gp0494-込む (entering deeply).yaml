formation:
  '[Verb-masu stem] + 込む': Indicates the action is done 'into' something, either literally or figuratively.
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  usage-context: general
etymology: The verb 「込む」 originally meant "to be crowded" or "to be packed." It combines the verb 「入る」
  (to enter) with the nuance of being densely filled. When used as a suffix, it retains this sense of
  entering completely or deeply into a state or action.
writeup: The verb 「込む」 (komu) is primarily used as a suffix attached to the masu-stem of other verbs.
  It indicates that an action is performed 'into' something, conveying a sense of complete or thorough
  entry. This can be interpreted both literally, as physically entering a space, or figuratively, as delving
  deeply into a state or activity. This grammar point focuses on the core meaning of 'to put into (A)'
  or 'to go into (A)', where 'A' is the action indicated by the preceding verb. The nuance often implies
  that the entry is not necessarily easy, and once an action or state is 'entered into' with 「込む」, it
  signifies a deep or committed engagement. Think of it as 'jamming (B) into (A)', suggesting a full and
  often irreversible integration.
false_friends:
  - term: 込む ②
    meaning: To do thoroughly, deeply, intensely
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While the grammar point `込む (entering deeply)` focuses on physically or figuratively entering
      deeply, `Verb[masu-stem] + 込む (thoroughly)` emphasizes the **intensity** or **completion** of the
      action itself, rather than the direction of entry. For example, `読み込む` means to read thoroughly,
      not just to read into something.
    grammar_point: 込む (to do thoroughly)
  - term: 入る
    meaning: to enter
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「入る」 is a general verb for entering. In contrast, `Verb[masu-stem] + 込む (entering deeply)`
      emphasizes entering **deeply**, **thoroughly**, or sometimes with a sense of **difficulty** or **force**
      (like 'jamming' something in).
    grammar_point: 入る (to enter)
  - term: 入れる
    meaning: to put in, to insert
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「入れる」 is a general transitive verb for putting something inside. `Verb[masu-stem] + 込む (entering
      deeply)` implies putting something in with a sense of **force**, **tightness**, or **completeness**,
      often resulting in a packed state.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:入れる (to put in)
  - term: 書く
    meaning: to write
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「書く」 is the general verb 'to write.' However, `書き込む` (formed by `書く` + `込む`) specifically
      means to write **into** a designated space, like filling out a form or making an entry. This `~込む`
      form emphasizes the action's target and completeness within that target.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:書く (to write)
  - term: 出す
    meaning: to take out, to submit
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「出す」 typically means 'to take out' or 'to submit.' When combined with `込む` as in `出し込む`, it
      takes on the meaning of bringing ideas or contributions **fully and thoroughly** into a shared space
      or discussion, emphasizing deep contribution rather than just simple output.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:出す (to put out)
  - term: 抱える
    meaning: to hold, to have (a problem)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「抱える」 means to hold or carry. However, `抱え込む` (formed by `抱える` + `込む`) signifies holding something
      **deeply** and **internally**, often metaphorical burdens or emotions, with a strong sense of internalizing
      and keeping them to oneself.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:抱える (to hold)
  - term: 始める
    meaning: to begin
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「始める」 means to simply initiate an action. In contrast, `取り組む` (formed by `取り` + `組む` + `込む`
      in its original meaning, though its current usage with `込む` emphasizes thorough engagement) implies
      to **tackle** or engage with something **seriously and thoroughly**, indicating a deeper commitment
      than just starting.
    grammar_point: はじめる (to start doing)
  - term: 多い
    meaning: many, much
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「多い」 is an adjective describing a large quantity. `詰め込まれる` (passive form of `詰める` + `込む`)
      means something is packed **full** or **dense** with items or details, often implying intentional
      thoroughness or a compressed state. The emphasis is on the **completeness of packing** rather than
      just quantity.
    grammar_point: 多い (many・a lot・much)
  - term: できる
    meaning: can do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「できる」 (or `することができる`) expresses general ability. However, `適応し込める` (formed by `適応する` + potential
      `込める`) implies a **deeper, more complete ability** to adapt or integrate into a situation, going
      beyond simple capability to suggest true absorption.
    grammar_point: できる (can do)
  - term: 我慢する
    meaning: to endure, to put up with
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「我慢する」 means to endure or tolerate external hardships. In contrast, `飲み込む` (formed by `飲む`
      + `込む`), when used figuratively, specifically implies **suppressing** or 'swallowing down' internal
      feelings, words, or objections, suggesting an internal act of concealment rather than just tolerating.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:我慢する (to endure)
  - term: 邪魔する
    meaning: to interrupt or bother
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「邪魔する」 is a general verb for interrupting or bothering. In contrast, `割り込む` emphasizes rudely
      cutting into a conversation or line, implying a more direct and often impolite insertion.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:邪魔する (to interrupt)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「込む」 (into) emphasizes entering or placing something deeply and thoroughly,
  several other verbs exist that express general actions like 'entering,' 'putting in,' or 'starting.'
  For instance, 「入る」 and 「入れる」 are general verbs for entry or insertion, lacking the nuance of forcefulness
  or completeness that 「～込む」 conveys. Similarly, 「書く」 is to write, but 「書き込む」 specifically means to write
  *into* a document. 「出す」 is to take out, while 「出し込む」 implies bringing contributions into a shared space.
  Other verbs like 「抱える」 (to hold) and 「始める」 (to begin) are more general than their 「～込む」 counterparts
  (「抱え込む」 for deep internalization, 「取り組む」 for serious engagement). And finally, 「多い」 (many) describes
  quantity, whereas 「詰め込まれる」 suggests being densely packed. Pay close attention to the specific context
  and the added nuance of intensity or thoroughness that 「～込む」 provides.

      forcing something into a tight space.

    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older

      sense of rudely interrupting or cutting in.

    nuance: 「出し込みましょう」 is a polite and inclusive suggestion, common for a team leader. 「出し込もう」 is the
      casual volitional, suitable for a more informal team setting. 「出し込むか」 is a very casual, almost musing,

      emphasizes the ongoing nature of the engagement.

      can be a common action for a younger woman trying to maintain composure in a reflective moment.
      The polite form 「飲み込みました」 can be used when recounting the event.

      and figuratively, to suppress or accept something difficult without complaint, often emotions or
      words.
post_example_writeup: When 「込む」 is used as a suffix, it often adds the nuance of performing an action
  thoroughly, deeply, or with full commitment. It can also imply that the action is difficult or requires
  effort, like 'forcing' something in, or that the resulting state is one of being completely immersed
  or contained.
