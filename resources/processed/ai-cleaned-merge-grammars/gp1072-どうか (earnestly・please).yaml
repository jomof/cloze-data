details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  function: Used to add emphasis to a request, conveying sincerity and earnestness
etymology: The etymology of 「どうか」 is somewhat uncertain, but it's believed to have evolved from phrases
  emphasizing a particular state or condition. It carries a sense of wishing for a certain outcome or
  hoping for something to be realized.
writeup: 「どうか」 is an adverb used to express a strong and sincere request or plea. It adds emphasis to
  the request, conveying a sense of earnestness and politeness. It is often used in situations where you
  are asking for something important or when you want to show extra respect to the person you are asking.
  Because of its politeness, it's not typically used in casual conversation among close friends. However,
  you will see it in business situations and also in personal situations.

  - term: どうぞ
    meaning: Please; Here you are
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「どうか」 and 「どうぞ」 express politeness, 「どうぞ」 is more commonly used to offer something
      or invite someone to do something, whereas 「どうか」 is a stronger, more earnest request, a plea.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:どうぞ (please)
  - term: 是非
    meaning: By all means; Definitely; Without fail
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「是非」 expresses the speaker's strong will or desire for something to happen, often as a strong
      recommendation or encouragement. 「どうか」, in contrast, expresses a sincere and earnest plea or request
      directed towards the listener, often implying a difficult or emotional situation for the speaker.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:是非 (by all means; definitely; without fail)
post_false_friends_writeup: The key difference between 「どうか」 and 「どうぞ」 lies in their usage. Use 「どうぞ」
  when offering or inviting someone to do something. Use 「どうか」 when making a heartfelt request or plea,
  often implying a more difficult or emotional circumstance. While both add politeness, 「どうか」 adds a stronger
  emphasis to the request than 「どうぞ」. Furthermore, 「是非」 expresses the speaker's strong personal desire
  or recommendation for an action or outcome. While it can also mean "by all means," it focuses on the
  speaker's will, whereas 「どうか」 is a direct appeal to the listener, emphasizing sincerity and earnestness
  in the request itself.

          a direct command.
    scene: A parent wishing for their child's well-being.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「健やかに育ちますように」 is a heartfelt wish for a child's healthy growth. The addition of 「どうか」 intensifies
      this wish, making it a profound and earnest prayer from a parent, highlighting the depth of their
      hope and concern for their child's future.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 「どうか」 is a powerful adverb for conveying a deep
  sense of sincerity and urgency in requests and wishes. It elevates the level of politeness and emotional
  weight, making your appeal much more heartfelt. Pay attention to the context and the level of earnestness
  you wish to convey when choosing to use 「どうか」.
