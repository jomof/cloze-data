etymology: The word いつも (itsumo) originates from いつ (itsu), meaning "when," combined with the particle
  も (mo), meaning "also" or "even." The literal interpretation is "even when" or "at any time," which
  naturally evolved to signify "always" or "at all times." This linguistic evolution highlights how a
  concept of indefinite time (any point in time) can lead to the meaning of constant presence or occurrence.
writeup: いつも is a versatile Japanese adverb that translates to "always," "usually," or "at all times,"
  depending on the context. Its core meaning conveys a high degree of regularity or constancy. It is fundamental
  for describing habits, recurring events, or unchanging states. When used with verbs, いつも indicates that
  an action is performed habitually or continuously. For example, いつも本を読む (itsumo hon o yomu) means "I
  always read books." It is frequently paired with the 〜ている form of verbs to emphasize an ongoing or habitual
  action, such as いつも走っている (itsumo hashitteiru), "I am always running" or "I always run (as a habit)."
  With adjectives and nouns, いつも describes a constant quality or state. For instance, いつも元気だ (itsumo genki
  da) means "I am always well/energetic," describing a continuous state of being. While often translated
  as "always," いつも can sometimes carry the nuance of "usually" or "generally," especially when talking
  about personal habits or typical situations. The exact interpretation often depends on the speaker's
  intent and the broader context. However, it generally implies a higher frequency or stronger consistency
  than たいてい (usually) or よく (often). It is a neutral term that can be used across various registers, from
  casual conversation to more formal settings.
false_friends:
  - term: たいてい
    meaning: Usually; mostly.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While たいてい also expresses frequency, it suggests "most of the time" or "generally," implying
      exceptions are more likely than with いつも. いつも implies higher regularity.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:たいてい (usually)
  - term: よく
    meaning: Often; frequently.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: よく indicates high frequency, but not necessarily "always." It can also mean "well" or "skillfully,"
      unlike いつも. いつも focuses on constancy.
    grammar_point: よく (frequently・often・well)
  - term: 常に (tsune ni)
    meaning: Always; constantly.
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 常に is more formal, literary, and emphasizes absolute constancy or unchanging nature. いつも is
      more common in everyday speech.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:常に (always・constantly)
post_false_friends_writeup: While いつも, たいてい, よく, and 常に all relate to frequency, their nuances differ.
  いつも indicates a very high degree of regularity, often meaning "always" or "at all times." たいてい implies
  "most of the time," suggesting exceptions are possible. よく signifies "frequently" but does not necessarily
  imply constancy, and can also mean "well." 常に is a more formal and absolute equivalent to いつも, emphasizing
  unchanging constancy. Choose いつも when you mean something happens nearly without exception or as a consistent
  habit.

    scene: A person expressing enduring feelings to someone they care about.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
post_example_writeup: Notice how いつも often appears with verbs in the progressive 〜ている form when describing
  habitual actions, reinforcing the sense of continuity or constancy. When used with negative forms, it
  means 'never' or 'not at all' in a consistent manner.
