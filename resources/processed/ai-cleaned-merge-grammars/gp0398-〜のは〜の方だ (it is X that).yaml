  katakana: ノハ エックス ノ ホウダ
  romaji: no wa X no hō da
formation:
  '[Phrase] + のは + [Noun] + の方だ': Highlights that one element or person within a group or situation is
    particularly relevant or responsible for something.
jlpt: N3
details:
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: general use
  function: emphasis, clarification, gentle assertion
  nuance: This structure softens a direct statement, implying 'it's on the side of X' rather than 'it
    is X'. It often highlights contrast or takes responsibility in a nuanced way.
  colocation: Often used with personal pronouns like 私 (watashi)・僕 (boku)・俺 (ore)・彼女 (kanojo)・ and with
    professional titles or groups such as 社長 (shachō)・営業部 (eigyoubu).
etymology: 'The construction is built from: 「の」 (nominalizer)・「は」 (topic marker)・「方」 (direction/side)
  and 「だ」 (copula). Literally, it means ''''the one on the side of X''''・which implies something more
  nuanced than a direct assertion・often used for emphasis or to soften a statement by indicating one ''''side''''
  is responsible or relevant.'
writeup: '「のはXの方だ」 is an expression used to emphasize that X is the one responsible for or associated
  with a certain action or situation. It highlights a particular element or person, often against the
  backdrop of other possibilities or expectations. While directly stating ''''X is Y'''' with simple particles
  like が or は suffices for factual statements, adding 「の方だ」 introduces a nuance of ''''being on the side
  of'''' or ''''being affiliated with''''・which can either soften a potentially harsh assertion or provide
  a clearer・more emphatic identification. The grammar point consists of the following components: のは:
  This part nominalizes the preceding phrase・turning it into a noun clause. 「は」 acts as a contrastive
  topic marker・drawing attention to what follows. X: This is the noun or noun phrase that identifies ''''the
  one'''' being emphasized. の方だ: 「の」 is a possessive or specifying particle・and 「方」 (hō) literally means
  ''''side'''' or ''''direction''''. Together with the copula 「だ」 (or its polite form 「です」)・it expresses
  ''''it is on the side of X''''. This indirectness makes the statement less blunt. This pattern is frequently
  used to accept responsibility apologetically・implying ''''I am the one responsible''''・even if there
  are other contributing factors. It also serves to clarify who or what is truly at fault・or who fits
  a particular description・especially when there might be a misunderstanding or a need for precise identification.'
false_friends:
  - term: '[Phrase] + が + [Verb Adjective Noun + だ]'
    meaning: It is [Phrase] that [Verb/Adjective/Noun]. / X is Y. (Direct statement)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This construction states a fact directly without the nuanced emphasis or softening that 「のはXの方だ」
      provides. It assigns responsibility or identification bluntly, lacking the 'side of X' implication.
      While grammatically correct, it might lack the specific nuance of contrast or gentle assertion that
      「のはXの方だ」 offers.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:基本の肯定文 (basic affirmative sentence)
  - term: のは〜のことだ (emphasizing time or circumstance)
    meaning: It was/is that...
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While sharing the 「のは」 structure・「のは〜のことだ」 focuses on clarifying or emphasizing *when* or
      *under what circumstances* something happened. It typically indicates a specific time・event・or the
      meaning of something・rather than identifying the responsible party or contrasting specific entities
      as 「のはXの方だ」 does.
    grammar_point: のは〜のことだ (emphasizing time or circumstance)
post_false_friends_writeup: When considering the phrase 「のはXの方だ」・it's important to differentiate it from
  simply stating a fact using 「が」 or the copula 「だ」. While expressions like 「Xが[Verb/Adjective/Noun]だ」
  or 「Xは[Verb/Adjective/Noun]だ」 convey the core meaning・they do so directly. 「のはXの方だ」・on the other hand・adds
  a layer of emphasis or softening・highlighting X as the specific entity in focus・often in contrast to
  others or to gently assert responsibility. It's not about being grammatically wrong・but about choosing
  the expression that best conveys the intended nuance and level of emphasis.

  the statement more gentle or indirect. It is often used when acknowledging responsibility or gently
  correcting someone・highlighting the specific party involved in a given situation.
