    "writeup": "**今更 (imasara)** is an adverb used to express the feeling that something is too late, or that it's pointless to do something after a certain amount of time has passed. It conveys a sense of belatedness and often carries a nuance of regret or resignation. It can be used in various contexts, from casual conversations to more formal settings, depending on the specific sentence structure and tone.\n\n*   It can be used with question words to rhetorically question the point of something, such as 「今更何が言いたいのか (imasara nani ga iitai no ka)」, meaning \"What do you want to say now (at this late date)?\"\n*   It is often used with negative predicates to express that it is too late to do something: 「今更行けない (imasara ikenai)」, meaning \"It’s too late to go (there).\"\n*   You may also see it with the pattern 「今更 + Vても/Vたところで + Negative Predicate」, expressing that doing something now is pointless, like 「今更見ても仕方がない (imasara mitemo shikata ga nai)」, which means \"It is no use looking at it now.\"",
