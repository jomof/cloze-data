        "register": "casual",
        "nuance": "今更 (imasara) conveys a sense of belatedness, futility, or inappropriateness. It implies that a certain action, thought, or realization is occurring too late, rendering it pointless, ineffective, or even regrettable given the current circumstances. It can express exasperation, resignation, or a sudden, belated understanding.",
        "colocation": "Often used with negative predicates or expressions of futility. Commonly paired with verbs in the ても form or たところで. Can also be used with question words to express exasperation.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as an adverb modifying the entire clause or predicate that follows it.",
        "temporal-flow": "Highlights a state or action that is significantly delayed relative to an appropriate or timely point, creating a sense of being 'behind' or 'out of time'."
    },
    "etymology": "今 (ima) means \"now,\" and 更 (sara) means \"again\" or \"further.\" The combination creates a nuance of something happening \"now, but after it should have already passed\" or \"now, when it is too late to make a difference.\"",
    "writeup": "**今更 (imasara)** is an adverb used to express the sentiment that something is occurring too late, is pointless, or is no longer relevant given the circumstances. It carries a strong connotation of belatedness, often implying regret, resignation, or even sarcasm. This term highlights a mismatch between the timing of an action or realization and the current situation, suggesting that any effort now would be futile or inappropriate.\n\nIt is frequently used with negative predicates, emphasizing the impossibility or ineffectiveness of an action at this late stage. For example, 「今更言っても遅い」 (Imasara ittemo osoi) means \"Even if you say it now, it's too late.\" It can also be combined with question words to express exasperation, such as 「今更何をするつもりだ」 (Imasara nani o suru tsumori da?) meaning \"What do you intend to do now, after all this time?\"\n\nBeyond expressing futility, 今更 can also be used to convey a **belated realization** or appreciation, often appearing in the form 「今更ながら (imasara nagara)」. In these cases, it signifies that the speaker has only now come to understand or appreciate something that they should have recognized much earlier. This usage is less about futility and more about a moment of delayed insight. For example, 「親になって今更ながら、母の苦労が分かりました」 (Oya ni natte imasara nagara, haha no kurō ga wakarimashita) means \"Having become a parent myself, I now, belatedly, understand my mother's hardships.\"\n\nAdditionally, 「今更ですが (imasara desu ga)」 is a polite phrase used to acknowledge that what one is about to say or do is belated, typically when offering a belated greeting or apology. This softens the potential awkwardness of the timing.",

            "english_literally": "Deadline has passed, so now even if panicking, it cannot be helped.",
            "scene": "A student giving up on studying for an exam after realizing they missed the sign-up deadline.",
            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "serious",
            "nuance": "The phrase 「仕方がない」 (shikata ga nai) strongly emphasizes the inevitability and futility of the situation, a common feeling when something is beyond one's control. The casual 「よ」 at the end makes it sound like a resignation to a friend or to oneself."

            "japanese": "彼 は もう 連絡 を 取ろう と しない から、{今更} 電話 して も 無駄 だろう。",
            "english": "He's not trying to contact me anymore, so it'd probably be pointless to call him now.",
            "english_literally": "He no longer try to contact, so now even if calling, probably useless.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene emphasizes the emotional component of 'too late' by highlighting the ex-partner's clear disengagement. This directs the learner towards 今更's nuance of futility due to belatedness, rather than just a general lack of meaning (意味がない)."

                {
                    "competing_grammar": "彼 は もう 連絡 を 取ろう と しない から、電話 する べき で は ない だろう。",
                    "mitigation": "The scene focuses on the ineffectiveness of the action given the timing, rather than a moral or social obligation (べきではない). 今更 highlights the pointlessness of the call *now*, given the elapsed time and changed circumstances."

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "supportive",
            "nuance": "The use of 「無駄だろう」 (muda darō) conveys a strong sense of futility and resignation. The implication is that attempting something 'now' is not just ineffective, but actively pointless because the opportunity has passed."

                    "mitigation": "The scene highlights the absurdity and impropriety of the timing. '今更' implies that sending invitations now is not just a 'why' question (どうして) but a 'why bother now when it's too late' question, conveying mild exasperation rather than mere inquiry."
                },

The polite 「のですか」 adds a formal tone to the questioning, implying the speaker is puzzled by the ill-timed action."

The speaker's newfound understanding of parental struggles, now that he is a parent himself, makes the reflection deeply personal and highlights the passage of time before this insight came. The use of 「よく 分かりました」 (yoku wakarimashita) indicates a clear and deep comprehension."

            "nuance": "「大変今更ですが」 (taihen imasara desu ga) is a polite, formulaic expression to acknowledge a significant delay. The use of 「送付いたします」 (sōfu itashimasu), a humble form of sending, further emphasizes the speaker's politeness and awareness of the belatedness in a business context. This phrase is used to soften the impact of the late delivery."
