        "nuance": "今更 (imasara) conveys a sense of belatedness, futility, or inappropriateness. It implies that a certain action, thought, or realization is occurring too late, rendering it pointless, ineffective, or even regrettable given the current circumstances. It can express exasperation, resignation, or a sudden, belated understanding.",
        "colocation": "Often used with negative predicates or expressions of futility. Commonly paired with verbs in the ても form or たところで. Can also be used with question words to express exasperation.",

        "temporal-flow": "Highlights a state or action that is significantly delayed relative to an appropriate or timely point, creating a sense of being 'behind' or 'out of time'."
    },
    "etymology": "今 (ima) means \"now,\" and 更 (sara) means \"again\" or \"further.\" The combination creates a nuance of something happening \"now, but after it should have already passed\" or \"now, when it is too late to make a difference.\"",
    "writeup": "**今更 (imasara)** is an adverb used to express the sentiment that something is occurring too late, is pointless, or is no longer relevant given the circumstances. It carries a strong connotation of belatedness, often implying regret, resignation, or even sarcasm. This term highlights a mismatch between the timing of an action or realization and the current situation, suggesting that any effort now would be futile or inappropriate.\n\nIt is frequently used with negative predicates, emphasizing the impossibility or ineffectiveness of an action at this late stage. For example, 「今更言っても遅い」 (Imasara ittemo osoi) means \"Even if you say it now, it's too late.\" It can also be combined with question words to express exasperation, such as 「今更何をするつもりだ」 (Imasara nani o suru tsumori da?) meaning \"What do you intend to do now, after all this time?\"\n\nBeyond expressing futility, 今更 can also be used to convey a **belated realization** or appreciation, often appearing in the form 「今更ながら (imasara nagara)」. In these cases, it signifies that the speaker has only now come to understand or appreciate something that they should have recognized much earlier. This usage is less about futility and more about a moment of delayed insight. For example, 「親になって今更ながら、母の苦労が分かりました」 (Oya ni natte imasara nagara, haha no kurō ga wakarimashita) means \"Having become a parent myself, I now, belatedly, understand my mother's hardships.\"\n\nAdditionally, 「今更ですが (imasara desu ga)」 is a polite phrase used to acknowledge that what one is about to say or do is belated, typically when offering a belated greeting or apology. This softens the potential awkwardness of the timing.",
