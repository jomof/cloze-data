    },
    "etymology": "The kanji 「型」 means \"mold,\" \"type,\" or \"model.\" It comes from the idea of something being formed or shaped according to a particular standard or pattern. Therefore, when attached as a suffix, it indicates that something is of a certain type or follows a certain pattern. The alternate kanji 「形」 (かたち/がた/けい) primarily denotes physical \"shape\" or \"form.\" The common pronunciation shift from 「かた」 to 「がた」 (rendaku) occurs when 「型」 is directly attached to a preceding noun, but it reverts to 「かた」 when preceded by the particle 「の」. In some established compound words, 「型」 can also take its on'yomi (Chinese reading) as 「けい」.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「型」 (かた/がた) is primarily used to indicate the **type, model, pattern, or design** of something. It is commonly attached directly to nouns, and its pronunciation typically changes from 「かた」 to 「がた」 due to rendaku (連濁), a sequential voicing phenomenon in Japanese. For example, 「新型」 (しんがた - new model) or 「人間型」 (にんげんがた - human type).\n\nHowever, when 「型」 is preceded by the particle 「の」, it often refers to a specific mold, template, or design used for creation, and its pronunciation remains 「かた」. For example, 「ケーキの型」 (ケーキのかた - cake mold).\n\nWhile 「型」 is used for abstract or general types and models, the kanji 「形」 (かたち/がた/けい) is specifically used for concrete, physical **shapes** or **forms**. For instance, 「星形」 (ほしがた - star shape) refers to the physical outline. If you are describing a geometric or physical contour, 「形」 is the appropriate choice. Though both kanji can be read as かた or がた, 「型」 is more common for abstract types, while 「形」 is for visual shapes.\n\nOccasionally, 「型」 can also be read as 「けい」 (its on'yomi or Chinese reading) when it is part of specific compound words, especially in more formal or technical contexts, such as 「形式」 (けいしき - format) or 「典型」 (てんけい - typical form). This usage is less about a direct suffixation and more about being a component of a fixed term.",
