    "etymology": "The particle 「なり」 is believed to originate from the classical Japanese word 「形 (nari)」, meaning “shape” or “state”. This suggests that the particle captures the idea of the immediate state or situation following an action, emphasizing the swift transition from one event to another. Essentially, it describes the shape of events immediately after something happens, highlighting the spontaneous consequence of the preceding action.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「なり」 expresses that something happens immediately after something else, conveying the meaning of \"as soon as (A), then (B)\" or \"the moment (A) happens, then (B)\". It connects two events that occur in very quick succession, highlighting the instantaneous nature of the cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nThis grammar point is typically used with verbs in their dictionary form (辞書形). The second part of the sentence (B) often describes something surprising, unexpected, or a strong reaction driven by emotion or will. While it can describe various types of actions, it is almost exclusively used to describe the actions of others, rather than the speaker themselves.\n\nWhile 「なり」 can be perceived as slightly old-fashioned or formal, it adds a certain literary flair and dramatic emphasis to the immediacy of events. It is most commonly found in written contexts or more formal spoken Japanese.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene implies an almost automatic, thoughtless action common to children, which 「なり」 captures well by emphasizing the immediate, almost instinctive, consequence."

            "speaker_age": "older",
            "nuance": "The phrase 「手 を 洗わ ず に」 (without washing hands) highlights the immediate and perhaps slightly inconsiderate action, which is a common observation for parents. This suggests an almost automatic, thoughtless behavior that 「なり」 effectively conveys."

                    "mitigation": "The scene sets up a situation where the reaction is so profound it's almost involuntary. 「なり」 emphasizes this emotional spontaneity more than とたんに, which merely highlights suddenness."

It emphasizes the direct link between the first action and the swift, sometimes unexpected, onset of the second. Pay close attention to whether the second event is a direct, almost involuntary consequence, or if it involves a surprising shift or a planned sequence.",
