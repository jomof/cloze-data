        "part-of-speech": "conjunction",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "general usage context",
        "function": "conjunction particle",
        "nuance": "Indicates immediate succession; often used when the second event is surprising, unexpected, or reflects a strong will or emotion. Typically refers to actions of others, not the speaker.",
        "source": "multiple sources",

        "temporal-flow": "The second action immediately follows the first with no significant time gap."
    },
    "etymology": "The conjunctive particle 「なり」 stems from the classical auxiliary verb 「なり」, which itself originated from the combination of the particle 「に」 (ni, indicating location or state) and the verb 「あり」 (ari, to be/exist). This auxiliary verb would attach to the attributive form of verbs or adjectives to signify a state or condition. In its conjunctive use, it evolved to express an immediate transition or consequence, highlighting the instantaneous nature of the progression. It literally means something like \"being in the state of [first action], then [second action].\"",
    "writeup": "The particle 「なり」 expresses that something happens immediately after something else, conveying the meaning of \"as soon as (A), then (B)\" or \"the moment (A) happens, then (B)\". It connects two events that occur in very quick succession, highlighting the instantaneous nature of the cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nThis grammar point is typically used with verbs in their dictionary form (辞書形). The second part of the sentence (B) often describes something surprising, unexpected, or a strong reaction driven by emotion or will. While it can describe various types of actions, it is almost exclusively used to describe the actions of others, rather than the speaker themselves.\n\nWhile 「なり」 can be perceived as slightly old-fashioned or formal, it adds a certain literary flair and dramatic emphasis to the immediacy of events. It is most commonly found in written contexts or more formal spoken Japanese.",

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "While 「なり」 emphasizes the immediate succession of events with a focus on a spontaneous reaction, 「と同時に」 indicates that two things happen simultaneously or nearly simultaneously, often without the same emphasis on surprise or strong internal impulse."

            "nuance": "Both 「なり」 and 「とたんに」 express immediacy, but 「なり」 often carries a stronger sense of surprise or unexpectedness, and implies a more direct, sometimes emotionally driven, response to the first action."

            "meaning": "As soon as",

            "nuance": "「次第」 implies that the second action will be done after completing preparations for the first one, often in a planned or conditional manner. 「なり」 implies the second action happens immediately, without any such preparation or planning, often as a direct, spontaneous consequence."

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「かと思ったら・かと思うと」 expresses a sudden, often unexpected shift or contrast from one state or action to another, highlighting a surprising change. 「なり」, in contrast, simply indicates the immediate timing of two events without necessarily implying a surprising switch in situation."

            "nuance": "「と」 is a more general conditional or temporal connector, indicating that when the first event happens, the second event invariably happens. It lacks the strong emphasis on immediate, spontaneous, or surprising succession that 「なり」 carries."

            "nuance": "While often interchangeable with 「とたんに」, 「途端」 (written with kanji) can appear in slightly more formal or literary contexts. Both convey suddenness, but 「なり」 still emphasizes the immediate, sometimes emotional or surprising, consequence more strongly."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "Distinguishing 「なり」 from similar expressions requires careful attention to the nuances of timing and emphasis. While expressions like 「と同時に」, 「とたんに」, 「次第」, and 「かと思ったら・かと思うと」 all relate to temporal succession, 「なり」 specifically highlights an immediate, often spontaneous or emotionally driven reaction. It emphasizes the direct link between the first action and the swift, sometimes unexpected, onset of the second. Pay close attention to whether the second event is a direct, almost involuntary consequence, or if it involves a surprising shift or a planned sequence.",
