    "etymology": "The particle 「なり」 is believed to originate from the classical Japanese word 「形 (nari)」, meaning \"shape\" or \"state\". This suggests that the particle captures the idea of the immediate state or situation following an action, emphasizing the swift transition from one event to another. Essentially, it describes the shape of things immediately after something happens.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「なり」 indicates that something happens immediately after something else. It conveys the meaning of \"as soon as (A), (B)\" or \"the moment of (A), (B)\". It connects two events that occur in quick succession. 「なり」 is typically used with verbs in the dictionary form (辞書形). The second part of the sentence (B) often describes something surprising or unexpected. It is almost exclusively used to describe actions of other people, not the speaker themselves.",
