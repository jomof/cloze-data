details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: casual
  particle-pragmatic-function: emphasis
  usage-context: Listing examples; expressing contempt, surprise, or downplaying. 「など」 is generally neutral
    or slightly formal. 「なんか」 is casual and often dismissive/contemptuous. 「なんて」 is casual and conveys
    surprise, disbelief, or contempt. 「などと」 is slightly more formal/literary and often implies a negative
    or surprising quote/thought.
  function: Exemplification, emphasis (often negative), emotional expression.
  nuance: 「など」 is a general enumerator, meaning 'and so on' or 'etc.' It can also be used to show humility
    or vague reference. 「なんか」 and 「なんて」 are informal variations that can carry a stronger emotional tone.
    「なんか」 often implies slight contempt, dismissal, or downplaying (e.g., 'such a trivial thing'). 「なんて」
    can express strong surprise, disbelief, or contempt, often in a rhetorical sense (e.g., 'How could
    something like that...!'). Both can also simply be casual listing. 「などと」 often follows a quotation
    or thought, expressing the speaker's negative or dismissive reaction to it.
etymology: The particle 「など」 is thought to derive from classical Japanese, combining 「な」 (indicating name
  or kind) and 「ど」 (a particle indicating place or extent). This historical origin helps explain its core
  function of indicating 'things of that kind' or 'examples among others'. The more colloquial forms 「なんか」
  and 「なんて」 evolved from 「など」, likely through phonetic shifts and the addition of emphatic elements, allowing
  for the expression of stronger subjective feelings like disdain, surprise, or downplaying, which are
  not inherent in the more neutral 「など」. The addition of 「と」 to form 「などと」 adds a quotative nuance, indicating
  'something like X' or 'thinking/saying X'.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「など・なんか・なんて・などと」 is used to indicate examples or to express a list of items, often implying “such as,” “things like,” or “and so on.” While they all share this basic function, their nuances, registers, and specific emotional connotations differ significantly.

  **など (nado)**: This is the most neutral and widely applicable form. It can be used in both formal and casual contexts. When used to list examples, it implies that the list is not exhaustive and there are other similar items. It can also be used to downplay the importance of something or to express humility, suggesting 'something trivial like X'.

  **なんか (nanka)**: This is a casual and more colloquial variant, primarily used in spoken Japanese. It often carries a nuance of dismissiveness, slight contempt, or downplaying. For example, if someone says 「ゲームなんか嫌いだよ」, it doesn't just mean 'I dislike things like games', but rather 'I dislike trivial things like games' or 'I disdain games'. It can also be used simply as a casual, slightly vague way to give examples without strong negative connotation, similar to 'or something' in English.

  **なんて (nante)**: Also a casual and colloquial variant, 「なんて」 is used to express surprise, disbelief, or strong contempt regarding the preceding noun or action. It often functions rhetorically, conveying the speaker's strong emotional reaction. For instance, 「嘘なんて言わないで！」 (Don't say such a lie!) expresses strong disbelief or objection. Like 「なんか」, it can also be a simple casual way of listing examples, especially when a speaker wants to express a certain emotion about the things being listed.

  **などと (nadoto)**: This form is typically used after a quote, a thought, or a statement. It implies that the speaker views the quoted content as foolish, trivial, or surprising. It carries a nuance of mild contempt, irony, or dismissiveness towards the preceding phrase. It's often used when narrating someone else's absurd words or thoughts, or even one's own past foolish ideas.
false_friends:
  - term: や (non-exhaustive list)
    meaning: To list a few items out of many; 'and so on.'
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「や」 simply lists examples without adding any particular nuance of dismissiveness, surprise,
      or downplaying, unlike 「など」「なんか」「なんて」. It's a neutral way to give a few examples.
    grammar_point: や (non-exhaustive list)
  - term: とか (hearsay)
    meaning: Listing examples casually; expressing uncertainty or hearsay; 'things like... or something.'
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とか」 is very similar to 「なんか」「なんて」 in its casual listing function. However, 「とか」 can also
      indicate hearsay or uncertainty, which 「など」「なんか」「なんて」 do not typically convey. It's also more strictly
      for *listing* examples, while 「なんか/なんて」 can be used for general downplaying or surprise without
      a list.
    grammar_point: とか (hearsay)
  - term: ばかり (only・excessive)
    meaning: Only, just, nothing but; indicates an excessive amount or focus on one thing.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「ばかり」 can mean 'just' or 'only,' which sometimes aligns with the 'downplaying' nuance
      of 「など」 (e.g., そんなことばかり言う - 'only say such things'), its primary function is to emphasize exclusivity
      or excess, whereas 「など」 and its variations are about exemplification, often with added emotional
      coloring.
    grammar_point: ばかり (only・excessive)
  - term: をはじめ (starting with)
    meaning: Starting with; not only...but also... (implies a representative example followed by others
      of similar importance)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「をはじめ」 specifically highlights a primary example, suggesting that other similar items or people
      follow. It implies the listed item is significant or representative, while 「など」 can be used for
      less important or even trivial examples, especially when downplaying.
    grammar_point: をはじめ (starting with)
  - term: はもちろん (not only... but also)
    meaning: Not only... but also; let alone; not to mention.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「はもちろん」 emphasizes that something is obvious or natural, and then extends that to other items,
      often implying 'even more so' for the subsequent items. It sets a baseline of what is already known
      or given, unlike 「など」 which can introduce examples without such a baseline.
    grammar_point: はもちろん (not only... but also)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between 「など・なんか・なんて」 and similar expressions, consider
  the speaker's intent beyond just listing. While 「や」 and 「とか」 also list examples, 「や」 is neutral, and
  「とか」 can imply uncertainty or hearsay. 「など・なんか・なんて」, particularly 「なんか」 and 「なんて」, often carry a subjective
  nuance of slighting, contempt, surprise, or downplaying. Expressions like 「をはじめ」 and 「はもちろん」, on the
  other hand, highlight a main example and then extend the scope, often implying importance or obviousness,
  which contrasts with the potentially dismissive tone of 「など」 and its variants.

      activity.

      opinion of her behavior. It expresses the speaker's judgment of the stated reason.

        english: To forget my wallet, I'm really forgetful!
        hint: This is a strong emotional reaction. We're looking for a nuance of surprise and self-reproach
          about forgetting something specific like 'my wallet'.
    scene: Someone realizing they've made a silly mistake, talking to themselves or a close friend.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The first 「なんて」 (nante) expresses surprise and disbelief at oneself for forgetting something
      as important as a wallet, implying 'something so basic/important'. The second 「なんて」 intensifies
      the self-reproach, conveying 'how could I be so forgetful!'. This is a common female expression
      of self-deprecating surprise.

    scene: An individual is asked about their opinion on current political events and expresses a lack
      of knowledge or interest in a polite manner.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: Using 「など」 (nado) here in a polite context helps to soften the statement, implying 'topics
      like politics' or 'and so on with similar complex subjects'. It's a way to vaguely refer to a category
      without sounding too abrupt about one's disinterest, maintaining politeness in the phrase 「よく分かりません」.

      for themselves. It adds a nuanced sense of distance or mild disinterest to the concept of marriage
      in their past thoughts.

    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: female

      own concerns about weight and appearance, almost as if saying 'I'm worrying about these trivial
      things like X and Y'. This nuance of downplaying one's own concerns is common in casual, intimate
      conversations, especially among female speakers.
