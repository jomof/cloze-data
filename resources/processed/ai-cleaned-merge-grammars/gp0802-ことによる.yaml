    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことによる」 is derived from the noun 「こと」 (koto, meaning 'thing' or 'matter') combined with the verb 「よる」 (yoru, meaning 'to depend on' or 'to be caused by'). Literally, it means 'due to the matter of,' indicating that the preceding clause is the reason for the result.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ことによる」 is used to express that a certain situation or result is **caused by** or **due to** a specific reason or action. It is a more formal expression, predominantly found in writing and formal speech. It typically follows a plain form clause: a verb or i-adjective in its plain form, a na-adjective stem followed by 「なことによる」, or a noun followed by 「であることによる」.
