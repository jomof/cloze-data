        "usage-context": "Used to inquire about the state, condition, or manner of something. Also used to express that a result or situation depends on a certain factor. This expression is more formal, so you'll find it more in writing or professional settings than in casual conversations.",
        "nuance": "Implies a level of formality and is often interchangeable with どのように. 如何 is generally more versatile, covering a broader range of meanings from direct inquiry to conditionality.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions adverbially, modifying verbs or clauses to indicate dependency or manner"
    },
    "etymology": "如何 originally comes from classical Chinese, where it carried a similar meaning of 'how' or 'what manner'. It was adopted into Japanese and has retained its formal nuance, often appearing in set phrases and formal documents.",
    "writeup": "**如何 (ikaga)** and **いかん (ikan)** are formal expressions primarily used to ask 'how' or to indicate that something depends on the condition or manner of something else. While it shares some semantic overlap with the more common どのように (dono yō ni), 如何 carries a significantly higher degree of formality and is almost exclusively encountered in written contexts or highly formal speech. Its usage suggests a more sophisticated and often official tone.\n\nThis grammar point frequently appears in constructions that denote contingency or invariability:\n\n*   **~如何だ**: This structure indicates that a situation or outcome is determined by, or depends on, a preceding noun.\n*   **~如何によっては**: This extends the meaning to express that 'depending on' a certain condition, a specific result may follow.\n*   **~如何を問わず / ~如何に関わらず**: These patterns convey that something holds true 'regardless of' a particular reason, method, or state.\n\nAdditionally, 如何 appears in the fixed phrase **如何ともしがたい (ikatomo shigatatai)**, which means 'there's nothing one can do about it' or 'it's beyond help,' expressing a sense of helplessness or resignation in the face of an unchangeable situation. While 如何 can technically be used to ask about someone's well-being (e.g., ご機嫌如何ですか - How is your mood?), this is exceedingly formal and rarely used in contemporary casual conversation.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 如何 shares some superficial similarities with expressions like 次第, による/よって, 如何して, 如何にも, and 如何な, it is vital to recognize their distinct functions. 如何 specifically focuses on conditionality or inquiring 'how' in highly formal contexts. In contrast, 次第 and による/よって express dependency in broader, less formal ways, while 如何して asks for a reason, 如何にも confirms an expectation, and 如何な describes a noun. Paying close attention to the context and the specific nuance conveyed is key to distinguishing these related expressions.",
