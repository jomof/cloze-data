    "writeup": "**如何 (ikaga)** and **いかん (ikan)** are used to ask \"how\" or to indicate that something depends on the condition or manner of something else. It's considered formal and often appears in written language or formal speech. Think of it as a more sophisticated way to say どのように (dono yō ni). \n\n*   **Usage**: It can inquire about the state of something, similar to 「どう」, or express that a result depends on a certain condition.\n*   **Formality**: This expression is more formal, so you'll find it more in writing or professional settings than in casual conversations.\n*   **Structure**: You'll often see it in patterns like 「〜如何で」 (depending on ~), 「〜如何によっては」 (depending on ~), or 「〜如何を問わず」 (regardless of ~).\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   「如何ともしがたい」 (ikatomo shigatatai) is a set phrase meaning \"there's nothing one can do about it\" or \"it's beyond help.\"\n*   While 如何 can be used to ask about someone's well-being (like 「ご機嫌如何ですか」), this usage is quite formal and not very common in everyday conversation.",
