    "etymology": "The grammar point のがじょうず combines の, a nominalizer that turns verbs into nouns, with が, a particle marking the subject, and 上手 (じょうず), which means 'skillful' or 'good at'. Thus, it literally translates to 'the thing of doing is skillful'.",
    "writeup": "〜{のが上手 (no ga jōzu)} is used to express that someone is skilled or proficient at doing something. It functions similarly to 〜のが好き (no ga suki, to like doing something), but instead of expressing a preference, it expresses an ability. The verb preceding {のが} should always be in its plain (dictionary) form, regardless of whether it's an Ichidan or Godan verb.\n\n*   **Important Considerations:**\n    *   To express being good at something in the past, keep the verb in the plain form and conjugate 上手 (jōzu) to the past tense (上手だった - jōzu datta).\n    *   Using this grammar point to describe your own skills can sound arrogant. To sound more humble, consider using 得意 (tokui), which conveys confidence rather than boasting.",
