    "etymology": "The grammar point のがじょうず combines の, a nominalizer that turns verbs into nouns, with が, a particle marking the subject, and 上手 (じょうず), which means 'skillful' or 'good at'. Thus, it literally translates to 'the thing of doing is skillful'.",
    "writeup": "〜{のが上手 (no ga jōzu)} is used to express that someone is skilled or proficient at doing something. It functions similarly to 〜のが好き (no ga suki, to like doing something), but instead of expressing a preference, it expresses an ability. The verb preceding {のが} should always be in its plain (dictionary) form, regardless of whether it's an Ichidan or Godan verb.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   To express being good at something in the past, keep the verb in the plain form and conjugate 上手 (jōzu) to the past tense, such as 上手だった (jōzu datta).\n*   Using this grammar point to describe your own skills can sometimes sound arrogant or self-important. To convey a more humble or confident, yet not boastful, tone, consider using 得意 (tokui). For example, 歌うのが得意です (Utau no ga tokui desu, \"I'm good at singing\") emphasizes personal strength or confidence, rather than an objective evaluation of skill.",
