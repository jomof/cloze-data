    "etymology": "The term 「ちなみに」 comes from the verb 「因む」(chinamu), which means \"to be connected with\" or \"be associated with.\" Over time, it evolved into an adverbial phrase used to introduce related information.",
    "writeup": "「ちなみに」 is a conjunction used to introduce additional, related information that is not essential to the main point. Think of it as a way to add an interesting side note or a relevant fact that the listener might find useful or interesting. It is similar to saying \"by the way\" or \"incidentally\" in English. 「ちなみに」 is generally used in more formal or semi-formal contexts; it is not typically used in very casual conversations among close friends. The information that follows 「ちなみに」 is often something the speaker thinks the listener might find interesting or useful, but it is not a direct continuation of the main topic. While both 「ちなみに」 and 「ところで」 can be translated as \"by the way,\" 「ちなみに」 is used to add related information, whereas 「ところで」 is used to change the topic completely.",
