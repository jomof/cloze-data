        "Register": "Generally used in formal or semi-formal settings. Not typically used in very casual conversation among close friends.",
        "Function": "Used to introduce additional information that is related to the previous statement but is not essential to it.",
        "Nuance": "The information introduced by 「ちなみに」 is often something the speaker thinks the listener might find interesting or useful, but it's not a direct continuation of the main topic.",

    },
    "etymology": "The term 「ちなみに」 comes from the verb 「因む」(chinamu), which means \"to be connected with\" or \"to be associated with.\" Over time, it evolved into an adverbial phrase used to introduce related information.",
    "writeup": "「ちなみに」 is a conjunction used to introduce additional, related information that is not essential to the main point. Think of it as a way to add an interesting side note or a relevant fact that the listener might find useful or interesting. It's similar to saying \"by the way\" or \"incidentally\" in English.\n\n*   **Formality:** 「ちなみに」 is generally used in more formal or semi-formal contexts. It is not typically used in very casual conversations among close friends.\n*   **Nuance:** The information that follows 「ちなみに」 is often something the speaker thinks the listener might find interesting or useful, but it's not a direct continuation of the main topic.\n*   **Distinction from 「ところで」:** While both 「ちなみに」 and 「ところで」 can be translated as \"by the way,\" 「ちなみに」 is used to add related information, whereas 「ところで」 is used to change the topic completely.",
