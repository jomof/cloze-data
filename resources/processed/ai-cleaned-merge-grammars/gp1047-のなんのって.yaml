    "etymology": "The phrase 「のなんのって」 is a colloquial shortening of 「の、何というのって」. It implies that something is so extreme that the speaker struggles to describe it adequately. 「の」 is a case marking particle, 「何」 (nan) means \"what kind of\", and 「という」 (to iu) means \"to say\", and 「って」 is a colloquial abbreviation of 「という」. ",
    "writeup": "「のなんのって」 is a casual expression used in spoken Japanese to emphasize that something is in an extreme state. It's often used to express a high degree of a particular quality or action.\n\nThe structure typically follows: \n*   **い-adjectives:** (e.g., 暑いのなんのって - \"It's so hot!\")\n*   **な-adjectives:** (e.g., 嫌いなのなんのって - \"I hate it so much!\") Note the な.\n*   **Verbs:**  (e.g., 食べるのなんのって - \"He eats so much!\")\n\nIt's similar in meaning to 「〜の〜ないのって」, which expresses the same idea but includes both the positive and negative forms of the adjective or verb. For example, 「怖いの怖くないのって」 (\"So scary that...\").",
