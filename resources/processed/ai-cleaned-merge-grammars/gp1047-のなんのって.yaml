    "etymology": "The structure consists of the case-marking particle 「の」, the pre-noun adjectival 「何の (nan no)」 meaning \"what kind of\", and 「って」, an abbreviation of 「という (to iu)」 meaning \"to say\". The literal meaning is something like \"and to say it's (A) or something,\" indicating that something is so (A) that the speaker struggles to describe it adequately.",
    "writeup": "「のなんのって」 is a casual phrase used in spoken Japanese to emphasize that something is \"excessively (A)\" or \"extremely (A)\". It's generally used in informal speech (タメ語). This structure is found after い-adjectives (in their plain form), な-adjectives (followed by な), and verbs (also in plain form).\n\nThe phrase implies that something is so intense that the speaker is almost at a loss for words. It conveys a strong feeling of \"so...that!\"\n\n「のなんのって」 is a condensed version of 「〜の〜ないのって」, which has the same meaning but includes both positive and negative forms of the adjective or verb. For example, \"to say it's (A) or not (A), (B),\" where (B) explains the extent of (A). Sometimes (B) is omitted, as 「〜の〜ないのって」 itself implies extreme (A).",
