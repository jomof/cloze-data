    "etymology": "The adverb 「より」 derives from the verb 「よる」 (yoru), which means \"to approach\" or \"to come near.\" Over time, 「より」 evolved to express comparison, indicating that something is closer to a particular quality or state than something else.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「より」 is used to express a **comparative degree**, indicating that something is \"more\" of a certain quality than something else. It's similar to adding \"-er\" to an adjective in English or using \"more\" before an adjective or adverb.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n*   「より」 often appears before adjectives and adverbs to emphasize the higher degree. For example, 「より大きい」 (yori ookii) means \"larger\" or \"more big.\"\n*   It's important to note that 「より」 itself does not inflect, but it modifies the adjective or adverb that follows it.",
