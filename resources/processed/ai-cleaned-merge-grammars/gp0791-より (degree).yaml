        "function": "comparative marker",
        "nuance": "While often translatable as 'more,' より carries a nuance of comparison against an established baseline or implicit alternative. It implies an increase 'beyond' or 'from' a certain point, rather than simply 'additionally.' It is frequently used in written language, technical descriptions, and formal presentations.",
        "counterpoint": "Compared to もっと, より provides a more precise and often formal comparison. もっと can imply a general desire for 'more' without a specific point of comparison.",
        "colocation": "Often used with adjectives expressing qualities (e.g., 良い, 速い, 少ない) or adverbs of manner (e.g., 効率的に, 迅速に).",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions adverbially to modify the degree of an adjective or adverb."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「より」 originally comes from the verb 「寄る (yoru)」, meaning \"to approach\" or \"to draw near.\" Over time, it evolved to indicate a point of origin or comparison, eventually taking on the meaning of \"from,\" \"than,\" or \"more than.\"",
    "writeup": "「より」 is an adverbial particle that indicates a higher degree or greater extent. It functions similarly to \"more\" in English, but it's important to understand its nuances, especially when distinguishing it from 「もっと」. 「より」 is typically placed directly before the adjective or adverb it modifies.\n\nThis grammar point is often used in contexts where a clear comparison is being made, even if the baseline for that comparison is only implied. For example, when you say 「より速く」 (more quickly), it implies 'more quickly than before,' 'more quickly than standard,' or 'more quickly than someone else.'\n\n**Usage Contexts:**\n*   **Formal/Technical:** 「より」 is common in business, academic, and technical writing or speech. It lends a sense of objectivity and precision to comparisons.\n*   **Implied Comparison:** While it can be used for explicit comparisons (e.g., AよりB), its most characteristic use is when the comparison point is implicit (e.g., 'more than *before*', 'more than *expected*', 'more than *the average*').\n*   **Emphasis on Improvement:** It is frequently used to express improvement or advancement, as in 「より良いサービス」 (better service) or 「より効率的」 (more efficient).\n\n**Distinction from もっと:**\n「より」 tends to be more formal and precise in its comparative function, often implying a comparison against a concrete or understood standard. In contrast, 「もっと」 is more casual and often expresses a general desire for an increase in quantity or degree, without necessarily referencing a specific comparison point. For example, 「もっと食べたい」 (I want to eat more) implies a general desire for additional food, whereas 「より少ない量で十分だ」 (A smaller amount is sufficient) makes a more objective statement about quantity relative to a need.",
