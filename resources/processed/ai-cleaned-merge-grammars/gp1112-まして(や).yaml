    "etymology": "The term 「まして」 comes from the verb 「増す(ます)」 (masu), meaning \"to increase\" or \"to add.\" The 「や」 (ya) is an emphatic particle. So, 「ましてや」 literally implies an increase or addition to the previous statement, highlighting the greater degree or likelihood of the subsequent statement.",
    "writeup": "「まして(や)」 is an adverb used to emphasize that if one statement is true, the subsequent statement is naturally true, even more so, or conversely, if one thing is unlikely or impossible, the following is even more so. It is often used to express a strong sense of contrast or comparison. It conveys the idea of \"to say nothing of,\" \"let alone,\" or \"much less.\" It is often used in formal contexts, including written language. In modern conversation, it can sound somewhat stiff or emphatic. It is used to show that if something is true or false, then another thing is even more true or false.",
