        "Clause A + まして(や) + Clause B": "When Clause A is true, Clause B is emphasized as being even more (or less) true. Often used when the latter clause describes an outcome that is an extreme example of the former.",

        "function": "Emphasizes a contrast or consequence, implying that if one thing is true or not true, another thing is even more so.",
        "nuance": "Used to highlight the extent of something by indicating that if one thing is true, another is even more so (or less so). Often used in contexts where there is a clear logical progression from one statement to another. It implies a strong and undeniable conclusion.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a conjunctive adverb, connecting two clauses or sentences where the second logically follows from the first with added emphasis.",
        "logical-flow": "Establishes a strong logical implication: if X is true/false, then Y is even more certainly true/false. It often builds on a baseline or a premise, then escalates or de-escalates the situation dramatically."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「まして」 comes from the verb 「増す (ます)」, meaning \"to increase\" or \"to add\". The 「や」 particle adds emphasis, indicating a stronger degree or extent. Therefore, 「ましてや」 implies that something is even more so than what was previously stated, emphasizing the increased degree or certainty of the second statement.",
    "writeup": "「まして(や)」 is an adverb used to emphasize that if one thing is true, another is even more so, or if one thing is not true, another is even less likely to be true. It is often used to highlight a contrast or consequence. It can be translated as \"let alone\", \"not to mention\", \"much less\", or \"still more\". This expression is commonly used in formal speech and writing, though it can appear in casual contexts to add strong emphasis. The particle 「や」 is optional, but its inclusion adds a greater sense of emphasis.",
