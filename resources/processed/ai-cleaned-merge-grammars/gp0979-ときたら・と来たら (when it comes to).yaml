pronunciation:
  katakana: トキタラ
  romaji: tokitara
formation:
  Noun + ときたら・と来たら + [Comment/Feeling]: Introduces a topic to express the speaker's strong opinion, frustration,
    or to highlight a well-known characteristic about it.
jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used in informal conversations among peers, often when expressing a complaint or highlighting
    a well-known characteristic.
  function: To introduce a topic and express the speaker's strong opinion, immediate reaction, or to highlight
    a significant characteristic about it.
  nuance: Expresses a strong, often instinctive, association between a topic and a subsequent reaction
    or observation, implying an obvious, expected, or frustrating outcome.
  grammatical-role: Functions as an emphatic topic marker, setting the stage for a strong opinion, reaction,
    or observation related to the topic.
  logical-flow: Introduces a topic (A) that immediately leads to a particular conclusion or observation
    (B), often implying that B is a natural, expected, or frustrating consequence related to A.
  temporal-flow: Implies a consistent or recurring characteristic or action of the topic.
  spatial-flow: Not applicable to spatial flow, but often refers to subjects within the speaker's personal
    sphere (e.g., 'my son,' 'my dog,' 'this printer').
etymology: The expression 「ときたら・と来たら」 is derived from 「と」 (a case-marking particle meaning "as for" or
  "with regards to") + 「きたら・来たら」 (the conditional form of the verb 「来る (くる)」 meaning "to come"). Literally,
  it translates to "when it comes to..." or "if it comes to...". This etymology highlights its function
  as a topic marker that sets the stage for a subsequent comment about the subject, implying a natural
  or expected consequence or feeling associated with the topic.
writeup: '「ときたら・と来たら」 is a versatile casual expression in Japanese used to introduce a topic about which
  the speaker wishes to express a strong opinion or observation. It typically follows a noun, setting
  the stage for a comment that is often a complaint, mild frustration, or an observation highlighting
  something expected or natural about that noun. While it can be translated as "that blasted (A)" or "that
  darn (A)" when expressing annoyance, its literal meaning remains "when it comes to (A)." This allows
  for its dual nuance: **Expressing Frustration/Complaint:** This is a common usage, where 「ときたら・と来たら」
  precedes a topic about which the speaker is annoyed or exasperated. The following clause will detail
  the problematic behavior or characteristic. **Highlighting an Expected/Natural Characteristic:** 「ときたら・と来たら」
  can also be used to introduce a topic whose subsequent action or quality is widely known, obvious, or
  simply what one would naturally expect. In this context, it doesn''t necessarily carry a negative connotation
  but rather emphasizes a quintessential aspect or typical outcome. Determining the specific nuance (frustration
  vs. expectation) relies heavily on the context and the content of the second half of the sentence. Despite
  these seemingly opposite nuances, both usages function to set up the topic (A) for an emphatic statement
  (B) about its inherent qualities or behaviors. This grammatical pattern is almost exclusively written
  in kana (ときたら), though と来たら with kanji is also seen, especially emphasizing the ''coming to'' aspect.
  Its directness often lends itself well to casual conversation where immediate reactions and shared understandings
  are common.'

  - term: について
    meaning: Concerning, regarding

  - term: ～のこととなると
    meaning: When it comes to (topic/matter of)..., concerning...

      inherent characteristics or behavior, 「となると」 is used to introduce a situation or condition that,
      if true or realized, leads to a logical consequence or a new state. It focuses on the conditional
      progression rather than a strong emotional reaction to the topic itself.
    grammar_point: となると (when it comes to)
  - term: に限って
    meaning: Only when; especially when; particularly when; those who; the only ones who (often with ironic
      or negative nuance)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「に限って」 highlights an unexpected, often inconvenient or ironic, occurrence that happens specifically
      when a certain condition is met or to a specific person/group. Unlike 「ときたら・と来たら」 which can express
      general frustration or a typical characteristic, 「に限って」 points out a peculiar, often unlucky, exception.
    grammar_point: に限って (ironic exception or disbelief)
post_false_friends_writeup: While all these expressions can introduce a topic or situation, 「ときたら・と来たら」
  stands out by immediately signaling a strong, often emotional, reaction or highlighting an undeniable,
  characteristic aspect. Unlike the neutral topic marker 「は」, the related topic introducer 「と言えば」, or
  the more formal 「について」, 「ときたら・と来たら」 implies a direct, sometimes exasperated, association. Similarly,
  while 「なら」 and 「から」 focus on conditional or causal relationships, and 「ったら・といったら」 on extreme examples,
  「ときたら・と来たら」 conveys an instinctive, often common, reaction or observation about the topic at hand. When
  you use 「ときたら・と来たら」, you're not just presenting information; you're sharing a strong feeling or a widely
  acknowledged truth about the subject.
