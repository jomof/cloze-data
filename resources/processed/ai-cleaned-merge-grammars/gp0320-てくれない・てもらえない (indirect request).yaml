jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: Used to make requests, ranging from casual to polite, implying a benefit to the speaker.
  function: Making requests or asking for favors indirectly.
  nuance: Softer and less direct than a simple imperative or ください form, often expressing a hope or expectation
    that the action will be performed.
  colocation: Typically follows the te-form of a verb expressing an action beneficial to the speaker.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a polite or indirect request
etymology: 「てくれる」 comes from the verb 「くれる」 (kureru), meaning 'to give'. 「てもらう」 comes from the verb 「もらう」
  (morau), meaning 'to receive'. The 'te' form of the verb indicates an action being done, so 'te kureru'
  is literally someone 'giving' you the action, and 'te morau' is you 'receiving' the action. The negative
  forms are used as requests, softening the directness of asking for something.
writeup: |-
  The grammar points **てくれない** (from **てくれる**) and **てもらえない** (from **てもらう**) are used to make requests or ask for favors. While seemingly negative in form (～ない), they function as polite or indirect questions, effectively asking, "Won't you do X for me?" or "Could you do X for me?".

  The nuance of these expressions comes from the verbs **くれる** (to give, implying an action done for the speaker's benefit) and **もらう** (to receive, implying the speaker receives an action). When combined with the te-form and negated, they soften the directness of a request.

  *   **てくれない**: This form is generally used for more casual requests to people you are familiar with, such as friends or family. It means "Won't you do X for me?".
  *   **てもらえない**: This form is slightly more polite than **てくれない** and is suitable for requests to acquaintances or in situations where a bit more deference is appropriate. It can be understood as "Couldn't I receive the favor of you doing X?".

  Both forms can optionally be followed by the question particle **か** (**てくれないか**, **てもらえないか**). Adding **か** further softens the request, making it sound even more polite and less demanding. Omitting **か** often makes the request feel more direct, though still softer than a plain imperative.

  **Politeness Scale (from least to most direct/rude to most polite):**
  1.  **てくれ**: This is a direct, strong command and can be considered rude, especially when addressing superiors or elders. It should be avoided in most social situations.
  2.  **てくれる**: A simple affirmative statement, "They do X for me," not a request.
  3.  **てもらう**: A simple affirmative statement, "I receive the favor of X," not a request.
  4.  **てくれない**: Casual request.
  5.  **てもらえない**: More polite request.
  6.  **てくれないか**: Softer casual request.
  7.  **てもらえないか**: Softer polite request.

  It is important to remember that these forms are requests, and their effectiveness relies on a rising intonation at the end, signaling a question. They are particularly useful when you want to ask someone for something without being overly demanding or direct.
false_friends:
  - term: 〜てください
    meaning: Please do ~
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: More direct and less polite than てくれない・てもらえない, often functioning as a command or a straightforward
      request.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ってください (polite request)
  - term: 〜てほしい
    meaning: Want someone to do ~
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Expresses the speaker's desire for an action to be performed, but it is not a direct request
      to the listener. It focuses on the speaker's internal wish, whereas てくれない・てもらえない directly solicit
      an action from the listener, albeit indirectly.
    grammar_point: てほしい (I want you to)
  - term: 〜ていただけますか
    meaning: Could I receive the favor of ~ (very polite request)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is a highly formal and polite request, significantly more deferential than 〜てもらえない. It
      expresses a strong sense of humility from the speaker.
    grammar_point: Verb[て]+いただけませんか (humble request)
  - term: 〜なさい
    meaning: Do ~ (polite imperative)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While polite, 〜なさい is a direct command, often used by parents to children or teachers to students,
      or in instructions. It does not carry the indirectness or implied benefit to the speaker found in
      〜てくれない・〜てもらえない.
    grammar_point: なさい (polite imperative)
post_false_friends_writeup: While **てくれない・てもらえない** are used to make requests, they differ from other common
  expressions. **〜てください** is a direct command or polite request, carrying a stronger imperative. **〜てほしい**
  expresses the speaker's desire for an action to be performed, but it is not a direct request to the
  listener. It focuses on the speaker's internal wish, whereas **てくれない・てもらえない** directly solicit an action
  from the listener, albeit indirectly. Forms like **〜なさい** are direct imperatives, typically used by
  superiors to inferiors, lacking the gentle, indirect nuance of this grammar. For the highest level of
  politeness in requests, **〜ていただけますか** is used, indicating extreme deference and often used in business
  or formal situations.

    japanese:
      - この 本 を 読ん で {くれ ない}？

    english_literally: Won't you give me the favor of reading this book?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 を 読ん で {ください}。
        english: Please read this book.
        hint: 「～てください」 is a more direct and formal command. We're looking for a softer, more casual request
          to a friend.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 を 読ん {で}。
        english: Read this book.
        hint: 「～て」 is a blunt command in this context. We're looking for a gentler, more polite request.
    scene: You're tired but want to know the story, asking a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The use of 「くれない」 here is a soft, casual request suitable for friends. This phrasing is a
      common way for female speakers to make gentle requests.
    etymology: The use of the negative form 「くれない」 is a rhetorical question that functions as a polite
      request, similar to "Won't you?" in English. The original meaning of 「くれる」 (to give) implies that
      the action is for the speaker's benefit. The negative question form softens the request, making
      it less direct than a command.

    japanese:
      - この 手紙 を 送っ て {もらえ ない}？

          - この 手紙 を 送っ て {ください}。
        english: Please send this letter.
        hint: 「～てください」 is more direct. We're looking for a slightly more polite and indirect request suitable
          for an acquaintance.

          - この 手紙 を 送っ {て}。
        english: Send this letter.

    scene: You're busy and ask an acquaintance for a small favor.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「もらえない」 offers a polite way to ask for assistance without sounding demanding, which is appropriate
      when asking an acquaintance. The male speaker uses this polite form to show consideration.
    etymology: Similar to 「くれない」, 「もらえない」 uses the negative rhetorical question. The verb 「もらう」 (to receive)
      implies that the speaker is receiving the benefit of the action. This structure emphasizes the speaker's
      position of receiving a favor, which inherently makes the request more humble and polite.

          - 明日、早く 起き {て}。
        english: Get up early tomorrow.
        hint: 「～て」 is a command. We're looking for a gentle suggestion, not an order.
    scene: You're trying to plan an early morning outing with your sibling.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: For family, 「くれないか」 maintains a casual tone while adding a touch of politeness, making the
      request sound less like an order.
    etymology: The question particle 「か」 further softens the indirect request, turning it into more of
      a suggestion or gentle inquiry rather than an expectation. This is common in casual settings to
      reduce imposition.

          - 窓 を 閉め {て}。
        english: Close the window.

    setting: serious
    nuance: The use of 「もらえないか」 is a polite and indirect way to make a request in a shared quiet space,
      suitable for asking someone you don't know well.
    etymology: Adding 「です か」 to 「もらえない」 increases the politeness level, making it suitable for situations
      where formality or respect is required, such as addressing a stranger or someone of higher status.
  - english: Won't you listen to what I have to say?

          - 私 の 話 を 聞い {て}。
        english: Listen to what I have to say.
        hint: 「～て」 is a command. We're looking for a softer way to ask for attention from a friend.

    setting: serious
    nuance: The casual 「くれない」 here can convey a slight plea or a touch of frustration when a speaker wishes
      for their words to be heard by a close friend.
    etymology: The use of 「くれ ない」 in this context implies a personal favor or an appeal to the listener's
      empathy, highlighting the speaker's need for the action to be performed.
  - english: Would you mind making a little time for me?
    japanese:
      - 少し 時間 を 作っ て {もらえ ない} でしょう か？

          - 少し 時間 を 作っ て {ください}。
        english: Please make a little time.
        hint: 「～てください」 is still too direct for addressing a busy superior. We're looking for an extremely
          polite and indirect request.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 少し 時間 を 作っ て {ほしい}。
        english: I want you to make a little time.
        hint: 「～てほしい」 expresses your desire, but it's not a direct request to the listener. We're looking
          for a polite way to ask for an action.
    scene: You're asking a busy superior for a brief meeting.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The use of 「もらえないでしょうか」 makes this request exceedingly polite and respectful, suitable for
      a subordinate addressing a busy superior. It demonstrates consideration for their time.
    etymology: The combination of 「もらえない」 with 「でしょう か」 creates an even softer and more tentative question,
      often used when addressing someone of much higher status or when the request is particularly burdensome.
  - english: Won't you stay with me a little longer?
    japanese:
      - もっと 一緒 に い て {くれ ない}？

      - competing_japanese:
          - もっと 一緒 に い て {ください}。
        english: Please stay with me a little longer.
        hint: 「～てください」 is too formal and stiff for an intimate or romantic context. We're looking for
          a softer, more personal plea.
      - competing_japanese:
          - もっと 一緒 に い て {ほしい}。
        english: I want you to stay with me a little longer.
        hint: 「～てほしい」 expresses your wish but doesn't directly ask the listener to act. We're looking
          for a gentle request or plea.
    scene: After a wonderful date, one person doesn't want the night to end.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「くれない」 conveys a desire for continued closeness in a gentle, almost pleading way, typical
      in evolving intimate relationships, and is common among younger speakers. The female speaker's tone
      enhances this subtle request.
    etymology: In romantic or intimate contexts, the indirectness of 「くれない」 allows for a subtle expression
      of desire or longing, creating a soft, inviting tone rather than a demanding one. This is part of
      the broader cultural tendency to avoid direct commands in personal relationships.

        english: Please help me prepare for tomorrow.
        hint: 「～てください」 is more formal than needed for a casual request to a roommate. We're looking for
          a friendlier, softer way to ask for help.

          - 明日 の 準備 を 手伝っ {て}。
        english: Help me prepare for tomorrow.
        hint: 「～て」 is a blunt command. We're looking for a considerate request to a friend.
    scene: You're overwhelmed with tasks and ask a roommate for help.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: This polite yet casual phrasing is ideal for asking a roommate or close friend for help, showing
      consideration for their time while clearly stating the need.
    etymology: The choice between 「くれない」 and 「もらえない」 often depends on the speaker's perceived social distance
      or the specific nuance they wish to convey. 「くれない」 can feel slightly more direct in its appeal for
      a favor, while 「もらえない」 is often used when emphasizing the receipt of a benefit.

          - その ペン を 貸し {て}。
        english: Lend me that pen.
        hint: 「～て」 is a blunt command. We're looking for a softer, more polite request in a casual setting.
    scene: In a classroom, you need a pen and ask a classmate.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: The casual 「くれないか」, often initiated with 「ちょっと」, is a very common way to make a small, polite
      request among peers, maintaining a friendly atmosphere.
    etymology: The adverb 「ちょっと」 (a little) often precedes these indirect requests to further soften them,
      implying that the favor is small and won't cause much trouble, making the request sound even more
      considerate.
  - english: Could you check these documents for me before the meeting?
    japanese:

          - 会議 の 前 に、この 書類 を 確認 し て {ください}。
        english: Please check these documents before the meeting.
        hint: 「～てください」 can sound more like an order from a superior. We're looking for a slightly softer,
          more collaborative request in a team setting.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会議 の 前 に、この 書類 を 確認 し て {ほしい です}。
        english: I want you to check these documents before the meeting.
        hint: 「～てほしい」 expresses your desire, but it's not a direct request for action. We're looking for
          a polite way to ask for an action.
    scene: A manager asking a team member to review some papers before a crucial meeting.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The addition of 「です か」 makes the 「もらえない」 form even more polite and suitable for a manager
      addressing a subordinate in a professional setting. This shows respect for the team member's time
      and effort while still making a clear request.
    etymology: In professional settings, the polite forms are often used to maintain harmonious relationships.
      The phrase is designed to mitigate the imposition of the request, reflecting the Japanese value
      of consideration for others (気遣い - kigatsukai).
post_example_writeup: It is important to note that **てくれない・てもらえない** are primarily used to ask for small
  favors or requests. For more significant or formal requests, other grammar structures may be more appropriate.
