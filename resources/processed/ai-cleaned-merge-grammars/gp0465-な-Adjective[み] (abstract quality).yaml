formation:
  な-Adjective Stem + み: Forms a noun indicating the abstract quality, inherent characteristic, or perceived
    state described by the adjective.
jlpt: N2
etymology: The nominalizing suffix 「み」 has roots in classical Japanese, where it was used to derive nouns
  from adjectives. It is conceptually linked to the notion of 'fruit' or 'content' (実・み), suggesting the
  'substance' or 'essence' of the adjective. This connection gives it a nuance of inherent quality or
  a tangible, often perceivable, aspect of a state, distinguishing it from 「さ」 which focuses more on a
  subjective degree or a general abstract concept.
writeup: |-
  The suffix 「み」 is attached to the stem of certain な-adjectives to transform them into nouns. This nominalization allows you to refer to the abstract quality or inherent state described by the adjective. While 「み」 is very commonly used with many い-adjectives to denote sensory qualities or inherent characteristics (e.g., 甘み 'sweetness', 悲しみ 'sadness', 温かみ 'warmth'), its application to な-adjectives is considerably more limited and often restricted to specific words.

  When 「み」 is used with な-adjectives, it typically emphasizes a perceived or inherent 'feel' or 'quality' of something, often with a nuance of depth, substance, or subtle presence. For instance, 「和やかな」(nagoyaka na, peaceful/gentle) forms 「和やかみ」(nagoyakami, peacefulness/gentleness), suggesting an intrinsic quality of peace rather than just a state of being peaceful. Another example is 「新鮮な」(shinsen na, fresh/novel) forming 「新鮮み」(shinsenmi), which implies a sense of inherent freshness or originality, especially when referring to ideas or approaches.

  It is crucial to understand that not all な-adjectives can take 「み」. Its usage is somewhat idiomatic and restricted to certain words. In most cases, 「さ」 is the more general and widely applicable nominalizer for な-adjectives (e.g., 静かさ 'quietness', 丁寧さ 'politeness'). The choice between 「み」 and 「さ」 depends on whether you want to emphasize a measurable degree or a more inherent, often sensory or subtle, quality.

  - term: さ
    meaning: nominalizer (degree or abstract quality)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「さ」 is a highly versatile nominalizer for both い-adjectives and な-adjectives, generally indicating
      a measurable degree or a general abstract concept. In contrast, 「み」, particularly with な-adjectives,
      implies an inherent, often more tangible or perceivable, quality. For example, while you can say
      「静かさ」 (shizukasa, quietness) for the degree of quietness, 「静かみ」 (shizukami, inherent stillness)
      would refer to a deeper, intrinsic quality of tranquility, though it is far less common.
    grammar_point: さ (nominalizer)
post_false_friends_writeup: While both 「み」 and 「さ」 are nominalizing suffixes, their nuances and commonality
  differ significantly, especially with な-adjectives. 「さ」 is broadly applicable to indicate a degree or
  a general abstract noun (e.g., 「大切さ」 'importance', 「複雑さ」 'complexity'). 「み」, however, is much more restricted
  and tends to be used to form nouns that represent an inherent, often sensory or subtly perceived, quality
  or 'essence' of the adjective. For example, 「確かさ」 refers to the measurable certainty, while 「確かみ」 implies
  the inherent reliability or authenticity. When in doubt, 「さ」 is generally the safer and more common
  choice for nominalizing な-adjectives, as 「み」 is reserved for specific, often nuanced, applications.

  nominalizer 「さ」. While some of these constructions might be less common in everyday conversation, they
  highlight the subtle expressiveness available in Japanese to articulate abstract qualities.
