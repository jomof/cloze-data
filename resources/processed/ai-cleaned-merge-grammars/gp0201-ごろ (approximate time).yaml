meaning: Around, About (time)
pronunciation:
  katakana: ゴロ
  romaji: goro
formation:
  Noun (time) + {ごろ}: Indicates an approximate time.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: suffix
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: General
  function: Indicates an approximate time or period.
  nuance: Suggests a broader, less precise approximation for time compared to 'くらい' in some contexts,
    and is exclusively for time. Can imply 'within the span of' rather than 'at the exact point of'.
etymology: The origin of 「ごろ」 is debated, but one theory suggests it comes from 「頃 (koro)」, meaning "time"
  or "about". 「ごろ」 softens the exactness of a time, making it approximate, often appearing as a colloquial
  pronunciation of 「ころ」.
writeup: "「ごろ」, often used interchangeably with 「ころ」 (especially in its kanji form 「頃」), functions to\
  \ indicate an approximate time or period. It is primarily affixed to nouns that denote time, such as\
  \ specific hours or broader timeframes like seasons or life stages. \n\nThis grammar point is frequently\
  \ compared with 「くらい」 (or 「ぐらい」), as both express approximation. However, there are crucial distinctions:\n\
  \n*   **Scope of Use**: While 「ごろ」 is exclusively used for approximations of time, 「くらい」 has a wider\
  \ application, covering approximations of quantities, distances, or degrees, in addition to time.\n\
  *   **Precision and Span**: 「ごろ」 often conveys a broader, less precise span of time. For example, 「子供の{ごろ}」\
  \ (around my childhood) suggests the entire period of one's youth. In contrast, when used with time,\
  \ 「くらい」 can imply a more focused or \"up to the extent of\" approximation, like 「３時{くらい}」 (around 3\
  \ o'clock, suggesting a point close to 3). Think of 「ごろ」 as indicating 'within the span of' a given\
  \ time, while 「くらい」 is closer to 'at the point of' that time, or 'up to the extent of' it.\n*   **Interchangeability**:\
  \ For very specific time points (e.g., 3 o'clock), 「ごろ」 and 「くらい」 can often be used interchangeably\
  \ without a significant difference in meaning. However, for broader or less defined periods (like \"\
  childhood\" or \"the Edo period\"), 「ごろ」 is the more natural and appropriate choice.\n\nIt is important\
  \ to note that 「ごろ」 is not used for approximating distances or quantities. For instance, you would say\
  \ 「２メートル{くらい}」 (around 2 meters), not 「２メートル{ごろ}」."

  - term: くらい
    meaning: About, approximately
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike `ごろ` which is primarily for time, `くらい` can also express approximate quantities, distances,
      or degrees. For specific time points, they can often be interchangeable.
    grammar_point: くらい (approximate quantity or degree)
  - term: とき
    meaning: When, at the time of
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While `とき` indicates a specific point or period in time, `ごろ` expresses a less precise approximation
      around that time or period, emphasizing a broader span.
    grammar_point: とき (when)
post_false_friends_writeup: While both `ごろ` and `くらい` indicate approximation, `ごろ` is exclusively used
  for approximating time, often suggesting a broader period or span. In contrast, `くらい` can approximate
  time, but also extends to quantities, distances, or degrees. Therefore, careful consideration of the
  context is crucial when choosing between them. Additionally, `とき` refers to a definite moment or period
  in time, lacking the approximate nuance conveyed by `ごろ`.

    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「三歳{ごろ}」 expresses an estimated age, common when an exact number isn't known, implying a gentle
      approximation. The polite casual 「だと思います」 or the more speculative 「かな」 is a common way for female
      speakers to express an opinion or guess in a casual setting.
    etymology: The application of 'ごろ' to age, as in '三歳ごろ' (around three years old), extends its meaning
      of approximation beyond strict temporal points to estimations of duration or stage of life.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, 「ごろ」 is a versatile suffix used exclusively
  for time to indicate approximation, whether it's a specific time point, a broader period, a routine,
  or an estimated age. Its primary function is to soften the precision of the stated time, allowing for
  flexibility and generalization. Pay attention to the subtle differences with 「くらい」 and 「とき」 to ensure
  you choose the most natural expression in Japanese.
