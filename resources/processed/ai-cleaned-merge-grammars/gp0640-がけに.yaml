    "etymology": "「がけに」comes from the verb 「掛ける(かける)」, meaning \"to hang, to suspend, to start, to begin.\" In this grammar point, it carries the nuance of something being done *in the process* of doing something else, like hanging an action *onto* another.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「がけに」 is appended to the ます-stem of a verb, indicating that an action (B) occurs 'on the way to' or 'while' performing another action (A). While it may not be as frequently encountered in modern Japanese, its nuance is crucial for understanding its usage. It suggests that action (B) is performed either incidentally during action (A), or specifically because action (A) presents a convenient opportunity for action (B). This structure can appear with or without its corresponding kanji, 掛けに, so familiarity with both forms is beneficial. The term derives from the verb 「掛ける」 (かける), a highly versatile verb in Japanese. In this context, 「掛ける」 conveys the sense of extending or placing something across a duration or process, thus implying that action (B) is carried out *along the span* of action (A).",
