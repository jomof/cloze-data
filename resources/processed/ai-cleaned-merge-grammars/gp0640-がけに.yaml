        "usage-context": "Used to express an action performed incidentally or conveniently during the course of another action or journey.",
        "function": "Adverbial phrase modifying the main action.",
        "nuance": "Implies that the incidental action is a natural or convenient consequence of the primary action or movement, often suggesting efficiency or a thoughtful detour.",

    "etymology": "「がけに」 comes from the verb 「掛ける(かける)」, meaning \"to hang, to suspend, to start, to begin.\" In this grammar point, it carries the nuance of something being done *in the process* of doing something else, like hanging an action *onto* another. It conveys the sense of extending or placing something across a duration or process, thus implying that action (B) is carried out *along the span* of action (A).",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「がけに」 attaches to the ます-stem of a verb, indicating that an action (B) occurs 'on the way to' or 'while' performing another action (A). While it may not be as frequently encountered in modern Japanese as some other expressions, its nuance is quite specific. It suggests that action (B) is performed either incidentally during action (A), or specifically because action (A) presents a convenient opportunity for action (B).\n\nThis structure can appear with or without its corresponding kanji, 掛けに. Both forms are valid, though the hiragana version is more common in modern usage. Familiarity with both forms is beneficial for recognition.",

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「がけに」, 「途中に」 or 「途中で」 simply state that an action occurs at some point during a journey or process, without necessarily implying convenience or integration into the primary action."

            "meaning": "While you are at it, On the occasion",
            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「ついでに」 emphasizes taking advantage of an opportunity to do something extra because you are already engaged in another activity. While similar, 「がけに」 focuses more on the action being performed naturally 'along the way' of a movement, whereas 「ついでに」 is about leveraging an existing occasion."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "Both 「途中に」/「途中で」 and 「ついでに」 can be used to express doing something \"on the way,\" but they have slightly different nuances. When using 「がけに」, focus on the idea of the action happening *during* the journey or process as a natural or convenient inclusion. 「ついでに」 is more about doing something *because* you're already doing something else and want to take advantage of that opportunity, regardless of whether it's part of a physical journey.",
