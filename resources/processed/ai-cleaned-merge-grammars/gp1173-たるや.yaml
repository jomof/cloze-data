    "etymology": "The particle 「たる」 originates from the classical Japanese verb 「たり」, which signifies a state of being or existence. 「や」 is an interrogative or emphatic particle, often used to introduce a topic or express surprise. When combined, 「たるや」 evolved to frame a topic with a sense of 'as for that state/condition,' leading to its modern function of introducing something noteworthy or remarkable about the subject at hand.",
    "writeup": "「たるや」 is a compound particle used to introduce a specific aspect or subtopic, invariably followed by surprising or impressive information related to it. It conveys a nuance similar to \"when it comes to...\" or \"speaking of...\" but carries a more formal and emphatic tone, often bordering on astonishment or strong admiration. Its usage is primarily found in written Japanese, such as essays, reports, or literary works, and in highly formal speeches or presentations. It is rarely, if ever, used in casual conversation, where less formal alternatives like 「というと」 or 「といえば」 are preferred.\n\nThis grammar point functions to set apart a particular element of the discussion, drawing the listener's or reader's attention to its remarkable quality or extreme nature. The information that follows 「たるや」 is typically unexpected, exceptional, or carries significant impact, whether positive or negative. While it can introduce a negative aspect, the core nuance remains that of highlighting an extraordinary degree or outcome.\n\nConsider 「たるや」 as a rhetorical device to underscore the profundity or extent of a given situation, making it stand out from the ordinary. Its formal nature lends itself to contexts where a sense of gravitas or elevated expression is desired.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「というと」 and 「といえば」 can both be translated as \"speaking of,\" and 「は」 can mark a topic, 「たるや」 conveys a significantly stronger emphasis and maintains a more formal tone. It is specifically reserved for highlighting something remarkable or impressive about the topic at hand, often eliciting a sense of astonishment or deep admiration. The other particles are more general and can be used in a wider range of conversational contexts without conveying the same degree of impact or formality.",
