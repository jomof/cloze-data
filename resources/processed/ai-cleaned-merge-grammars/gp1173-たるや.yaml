    "writeup": "たるや (taruya) is a compound particle that is used in formal writing or speech to highlight a particular aspect of a noun. It emphasizes something surprising, remarkable, or impressive about the subject being discussed. It is similar to saying \"when it comes to...\" or \"speaking of...\" but carries a more formal and literary tone. Think of it as spotlighting a specific detail to draw attention to its significance. For instance, 「その努力たるや」 (sono doryoku taruya) means \"when it comes to that effort...\" implying the effort was extraordinary.",
    "etymology": "The 'taru' portion likely comes from the classical Japanese auxiliary verb 'たり' (tari), indicating a completed action or state. The 'ya' (や) is a particle used for emphasis or to introduce a topic. Combined, they create a sense of focusing on a specific aspect to make a statement about it.",
