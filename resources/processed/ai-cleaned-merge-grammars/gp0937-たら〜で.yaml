    "etymology": "The grammar point 「たら〜で」 is a combination of 「たら」, which expresses a conditional state or a discovery, and 「で」, a particle that can indicate cause or reason. When used in a repetitive pattern, it creates a nuance of accepting a situation and its consequences, whether positive or negative.",
    "writeup": "The `たら〜で` construction is used to express that even if a certain condition (A) is met, a consequence or outcome (B) will still occur. It often carries the nuance that the outcome is somewhat contradictory or unexpected given the condition. It can be translated as \"even if (A), (B)\" or \"if (A), then (B)\".\n\n*   **たら/ば vs. なら**: When pairing with verbs or i-adjectives, either `たら` or `ば` can be used. However, when pairing with na-adjectives, use `なら`.\n*   **Nuance**: The nuance changes depending on the first part of the sentence:\n    *   In a good situation (A), a problem (B) will arise.\n    *   In a problematic situation (A), (B) can still be done.\n\nIn `たら〜で` constructions, it is important to remember that the nuance will change depending on the first half of the sentence. Basically, the most common interpretations are as follows:\n\n1.  In a good situation (A), a problem (B) will arise.\n2.  In a problematic situation (A), (B) can still be done.\n\nSo in either case, it can be seen that (B) will be something that is contradictory to (A). This grammar point is primarily used in standard, general contexts.",

B: ...), rewrite them into single-sentence statements that preserve the lesson but remove direct dialogue format.')\n• Added curly braces {} around the grammar point in Japanese examples (violation: Rule 6: 'The \"japanese\" should have the grammar_point in {bold} (surrounded in curlies).')\n• Added 'scene', 'register', 'setting' fields to all examples and ensured variety. Added 'speaker_gender', 'listener_gender', 'speaker_age', 'listener_age', 'nuance' where appropriate to meet diversity requirements.
