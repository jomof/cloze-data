        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "General conversational and written contexts.",
        "function": "To express that despite a condition (A) being met, a specific, often contradictory, consequence (B) arises directly from that condition.",
        "nuance": "This pattern emphasizes the inherent consequences of a situation. It conveys a sense of inevitability or acceptance that a particular outcome, which may be positive or negative, is a direct result of the stated condition. It highlights a contradiction: either a good situation leads to a problem, or a problematic situation can still be managed.",
        "source": "Bunpro"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「たら〜で」 is a combination of the conditional forms 「たら」, 「ば」, or 「なら」, followed by a repetition of the word or phrase in its plain form, and then the particle 「で」. This repetition and the particle 「で」 (which can indicate cause or means) create a nuanced expression suggesting that a specific outcome or consequence arises *directly from* or *due to* the very condition itself. It's not merely a simple 'if-then' statement, but rather a focus on the inherent implications of the stated condition.",
    "writeup": "The 「たら〜で」 construction expresses that even if a certain condition (A) is met, a particular consequence or outcome (B) will still occur. This outcome (B) often carries a nuance of being contradictory or unexpected given the condition (A). It can be concisely translated as \"even if (A), then (B)\" or \"if (A), then (B), precisely because of A\". This pattern employs conditional forms: `たら` or `ば` for verbs and い-adjectives, and `なら` for な-adjectives and nouns. The word or phrase forming the condition is repeated: [Conditional Form] + [Plain Form] + で. The specific nuance can vary. Firstly, in a seemingly positive situation (A), a problem (B) might arise. For example, gaining wealth might bring new anxieties. Secondly, in a problematic situation (A), a way to cope or a positive aspect (B) can still be found. For instance, being busy might necessitate better time management. In both interpretations, the key is that outcome (B) is inherently linked to and often contradictory to condition (A). This construction is primarily used in standard, general contexts. It is crucial to differentiate this from a simple conditional. The repetition emphasizes that the very existence of condition (A) is what causes consequence (B). Furthermore, when `なら〜で` follows other word types (e.g., verbs, nouns) in a different grammatical context, it typically conveys a distinct meaning, such as expressing dissatisfaction or giving strong advice, which is separate from this specific pattern.",

The repetition `合格 したら 合格 したで` emphasizes that the very act of passing brings its own new set of challenges, portraying a realistic perspective on continuous growth.",
            "etymology": "The use of `だろう` stems from `だ` (copula) + `う` (volitional/conjectural ending), indicating a strong likelihood or reasonable expectation."

            "etymology": "The expression `それ だけ` implies 'only that much' or 'correspondingly', emphasizing that the reward is proportional to the effort or challenge. `得られる` is the potential form of `得る` (える, to obtain), meaning 'can be obtained'."
