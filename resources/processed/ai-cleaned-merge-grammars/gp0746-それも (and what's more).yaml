pronunciation:
  katakana: ソレモ
  romaji: sore mo
formation:
  それ + も: Used to add an additional, often intensifying or clarifying, piece of information to a preceding
    statement.
jlpt: N2
etymology: 「それ」 (sore) refers to 'that' or 'it,' indicating a previously mentioned item or concept. The
  particle 「も」 (mo) adds the meaning of 'also,' 'too,' or 'even.' Thus, 「それも」 literally means 'that, too'
  or 'even that,' which evolved to imply 'and what's more,' as the added information often makes the preceding
  point stronger or more significant. It highlights an additional, often crucial, aspect of what was just
  said.
writeup: 「それも」 is a conjunction used to introduce supplementary information that reinforces, intensifies,
  or elaborates on the preceding statement. It functions like 'and what's more,' 'furthermore,' or 'and
  even that' in English. This phrase is typically used to add a detail that makes the previous point more
  convincing, surprising, or significant. It can also be used to add a specific, often negative, aspect
  of a previously mentioned general point.When you use 「それも」, you are signaling to the listener that the
  next piece of information is not just another fact, but one that adds considerable weight or an important
  dimension to what you've already communicated. It's often employed when presenting a series of related
  points, with each subsequent point building on the previous one to create a stronger overall impression.
  It can sometimes carry a slight nuance of exasperation or surprise, particularly when the added information
  is unexpected or compounds a difficult situation.

  - term: しかも (furthermore)
    meaning: moreover, furthermore, besides
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「しかも」 often connects two facts that are both true and logically related, emphasizing the addition
      of information that reinforces the first. While similar to 「それも」, 「しかも」 is more broadly used for
      simple addition and less likely to carry the 'even that' nuance of intensification or specificity
      that 「それも」 can.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:しかも (in addition・moreover)
  - term: その上 (in addition)
    meaning: in addition, furthermore, on top of that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「その上」 implies a natural progression of added circumstances or conditions, often building up
      to a more significant outcome. It feels more like 'on top of that' or 'what's more'. It's very close
      to 「それも」 in meaning but might be slightly more formal or general, whereas 「それも」 can feel a bit more
      abrupt and focused on a single reinforcing detail.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:その上 (in addition・moreover)
  - term: 加えて (in addition)
    meaning: in addition, additionally
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「加えて」 is a more formal and objective way to add information, often used in written contexts
      or formal speeches. It simply means 'in addition to X, Y also holds true,' without the emotional
      or intensifying nuance that 「それも」 can carry.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:加えて (in addition)
  - term: そして (and then)
    meaning: and, and then
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そして」 is a basic conjunction for sequential events or listing items. It lacks the emphasis
      or reinforcing nuance of 「それも」, serving primarily to connect ideas or actions in a simple chronological
      or additive manner.
    grammar_point: そして (and・and then)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「それも」, 「しかも」, 「その上」, and 「加えて」 all function to add information, their
  nuances differ. 「それも」 often brings a sense of 'and even that', emphasizing a specific detail that reinforces
  or compounds the previous statement. 「しかも」 is a general additive conjunction, while 「その上」 implies a
  building-up of circumstances. 「加えて」 is more formal and simply lists an additional point. Understanding
  these subtle distinctions allows for more precise and natural expression.
