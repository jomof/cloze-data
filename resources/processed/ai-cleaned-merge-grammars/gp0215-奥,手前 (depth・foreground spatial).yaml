jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: noun
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to describe spatial relationships, specifically depth and foreground in relation
    to an object or area. 奥 emphasizes the interior depth, while 手前 emphasizes the immediate front or
    near side.
  function: To specify a precise location within a space, indicating whether it's deep inside or just
    before an object.
  nuance: 奥 often implies something hidden, profound, or difficult to reach due to its deep location.
    手前 can sometimes imply a more exact or limited proximity compared to the general 'mae' (front).
etymology: 「奥」 (oku) literally means 'inner part' or 'recess', often associated with the hidden or profound.
  Its kanji combines a roof (宀) with a tree (木) and a person (人), suggesting a secluded space within a
  dwelling or deep within nature. 「手前」 (temae) literally means 'in front of one's hands' (手 - hand, 前
  - front), conveying the sense of being directly before or on the near side of something, hence its usage
  for immediate proximity or even one's own perspective.
writeup: |-
  「奥」(oku) and 「手前」(temae) are nouns that function primarily as spatial indicators, defining relative positions of depth and foreground. They are often used with the possessive particle 「の」 following a noun to specify a location relative to that noun (e.g., 「部屋 の 奥」 - the back of the room, 「駅 の 手前」 - just before the station). They can also be used adverbially with particles 「に」 or 「で」 (e.g., 「奥 に ある」 - it's in the back, 「手前 で 止まる」 - stop just in front).

  **奥 (Oku)**: This term signifies the innermost, deepest, or furthest part of an an area or object. It conveys a sense of being deep within, often implying that something is hidden, secluded, or requires effort to reach. For instance, the 'back' of a shrine or temple (神社 の 奥) refers to its most sacred, innermost area.

  **手前 (Temae)**: This term indicates the immediate front, the near side, or just before something. It implies a closer, more immediate proximity than the general term 「前」(mae). When used for spatial reference, it positions something precisely on 'this side' of a specified point or boundary.

  While both terms are used for spatial description, their nuances of depth and proximity make them distinct and crucial for precise communication in Japanese.
false_friends:
  - term: 前 (mae)
    meaning: front; before (time/space)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「前」(mae) is a more general term for 'front' or 'before', often implying a broader area. 「手前」(temae)
      is more specific, indicating 'just before' or 'on the immediate near side' of a point, often with
      a sense of a boundary.
    grammar_point: 前・後ろ (front and back spatial orientation)
  - term: 後ろ (ushiro)
    meaning: back; behind
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「後ろ」(ushiro) refers to the 'back' or 'rear' in a general directional sense, typically external
      to an object. 「奥」(oku) refers to the 'innermost' or 'deepest part' of an interior space.
    grammar_point: 前・後ろ (front and back spatial orientation)
  - term: 中 (naka)
    meaning: inside; within
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「中」(naka) is a general term for 'inside' or 'within' an enclosed space. 「奥」(oku) specifies
      the *deepest* or *innermost* part of that interior, implying a more remote or hidden location within.
    grammar_point: 中・外 (spatial and temporal reference)
  - term: 近く (chikaku)
    meaning: near, nearby
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「近く」 is a general term for 'near' or 'close by'. 「手前」 is more specific, meaning 'just before'
      or 'on the immediate near side' of a particular point, often implying a boundary or precise location
      relative to something.
    grammar_point: 近く,遠く (proximity・distance spatial)
  - term: 寸前 (sunzen)
    meaning: just before, on the verge of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「寸前」 indicates being immediately before a critical or significant event, often implying an
      impending, momentary action or state. While 「手前」 can mean 'just before' spatially, 「寸前」 is typically
      temporal and emphasizes the very last moment before something happens.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:寸前 (just before)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「前」 is broad, while 「手前」 is precise about
  immediate proximity. Similarly, 「後ろ」 indicates a general rearward direction, whereas 「奥」 points to the
  deepest interior. 「中」 refers to any point within an enclosed space, while 「奥」 specifically pinpoints
  the furthest reaches of that interior. Furthermore, 「近く」 describes a general vicinity, unlike the precise
  'just before' of 「手前」. Finally, while 「手前」 indicates spatial proximity, 「寸前」 specifically refers to
  a critical temporal moment just before an event.

    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「崖 の 手前」 precisely indicates the point of no return, emphasizing the immediacy of the boundary
      or danger. This usage highlights the precision of 「手前」 in describing a critical stopping point.
      「引き返しました」 (turned back) is a standard polite verb choice.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 「奥」 and 「手前」 are precise spatial markers. 「奥」 goes beyond
  simply 'inside' or 'behind' to indicate the deepest, most secluded part, and can extend to abstract
  concepts like profoundness. 「手前」 refines 'front' to mean 'just before' or 'on the immediate near side',
  often implying a slight offset from a main point or a critical proximity. Understanding these nuances
  helps in conveying exact locations and even abstract concepts of depth and closeness.
