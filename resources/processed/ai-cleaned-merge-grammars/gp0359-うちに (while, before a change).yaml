    "writeup": "「うちに」 indicates that an action or event occurs within a specific time frame or before a certain condition changes. It often implies taking advantage of a limited opportunity or preventing an undesirable outcome. It can be translated as \"while,\" \"during,\" or \"before.\" Unlike 「間に」, 「うちに」 doesn't specify *when* something happens within the given period, just that it happens at some point before the period ends or the condition changes.\n\n**Key Uses:**\n\n*   **Non-past verbs:** Expresses doing something while a certain condition is still valid. Example: 「元気なうちに旅行に行きましょう」 (Let's go on a trip while we're still healthy).\n*   **ている form verbs:** Indicates that something happens during the course of an action. Example: 「運転しているうちに眠くなった」 (I got sleepy while driving).\n*   **ない form verbs:** Means \"before\" something happens or a certain state changes. Example: 「忘れ ない うち に メモ し て おこう」 (Let's make a note before we forget).\n*   **い-adjectives and な-adjectives:** While the adjective's state is still true. Example: 「高 い うち に 売っ た 方 が いい」 (You should sell it while it's still expensive).\n*   **Nouns:** During the time period indicated by the noun.",
