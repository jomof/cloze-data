formation:
  Noun + ぐるみ: Indicates that the specified noun group or entity (e.g., family, company, community) is

jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: suffix
  register: formal
  usage-context: Emphasizes the complete inclusion or involvement of a group, entity, or object in an
    action or state. Often used to convey thoroughness or collective action.
  function: To emphasize completeness, totality, or comprehensive involvement of a group or entity.
  nuance: Implies thoroughness, unity, and that no part or member is excluded. Can sometimes carry a nuance
    of collective responsibility or engagement. When used with negative actions, it highlights the full
    extent of negative involvement.
  counterpoint: This expression contrasts with situations where only a part or some members are involved.
    It stresses that the action or state applies to the 'whole' entity.
  colocation: Primarily collocates with nouns representing groups or entities (e.g., 家族 'family', 会社 'company',
    地域 'region', 組織 'organization', 町 'town', 国 'country'). Less commonly, with nouns like 体 'body' or
    命 'life' to emphasize full commitment.
  grammatical-role: Functions adverbially, modifying verbs to show that an action is done 'as a whole'
    or 'including everyone/everything'.
etymology: The suffix 「ぐるみ」 is believed to be derived from the verb 「くるむ」 (kurumu), meaning 'to wrap,'
  'to cover,' or 'to include.' This linguistic root highlights the idea of encompassing something entirely,
  thereby conveying the sense of 'the whole' or 'including everything.' Its evolution reflects the natural
  conceptual leap from physically wrapping to metaphorically including all components of a group or entity.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「ぐるみ」 is a suffix predominantly attached to nouns, signifying 'the whole of,' 'entire,' or 'including everyone/everything.' It emphasizes that an action or state involves the complete entity or group, leaving no part or member out. For instance, 「家族ぐるみ」 (kazokugurumi) refers to 'the whole family' participating in an activity, stressing collective involvement.

  While its primary usage is with nouns denoting groups such as 'family' (家族), 'company' (会社), 'community' (地域), or 'organization' (組織), it can also be used with abstract nouns like 'body' (体) or 'life' (命) to indicate full commitment or involvement. For example, 「体ぐるみで参加する」 (karadagurumi de sanka suru) means 'to participate with one's whole body/effort.'

  It is less common, and often restricted to very specific or archaic expressions, to see 「ぐるみ」 directly attached to verb stems. When it does appear with a verb-stem, it carries a nuance of comprehensive involvement in the action, implying that the entire being or group is engaged in that activity. However, such instances are exceedingly rare and generally not productive forms in modern Japanese. Students should primarily focus on its robust usage with nouns.

  「ぐるみ」 is a formal expression and carries a slightly more emphatic tone than simpler phrases like 「全部」 (zenbu) or 「皆」 (mina). It implies a deeper level of unity or thoroughness in the collective action or state.

  - term: 全部 (zenbu)
    meaning: all; entirety
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「全部」 is a general term for 'all' or 'everything,' referring to the full quantity or extent
      of something. Unlike 「ぐるみ」, it doesn't specifically emphasize the collective involvement of a group
      or entity in an action, nor does it have the same suffixial function. It's more about quantity than
      unified participation.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:全部 (all)
  - term: 皆 (mina)
    meaning: everyone; all (people)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「皆」 specifically refers to 'all people' or 'everyone.' While it denotes a complete group of
      individuals, it lacks the broader application of 「ぐるみ」 to non-human entities like 'companies' or
      'communities.' It also doesn't carry the same nuance of 'as a whole entity' performing an action.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:皆 (everyone)
  - term: 全体 (zentai)
    meaning: whole; entire (as a unit)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「全体」 refers to something as a complete unit or whole. It's often used when discussing the
      entirety of an object, system, or concept. While similar in meaning to 'whole,' 「全体」 is a noun itself
      and doesn't function as a suffix to describe collective action or unified involvement in the same
      way 「ぐるみ」 does. For example, 「全体会議」 (zentai kaigi) means 'general meeting' or 'meeting of the whole
      group,' but it doesn't convey the sense of 'the whole group acting together' as strongly as 「団体ぐるみ」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:全体 (whole・entire)
  - term: 〜を挙げて (o agete)
    meaning: with all (one's might/resources); mobilizing all of something
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜を挙げて」 also expresses the involvement of an entire entity or group, particularly in collective
      action or effort (e.g., 国を挙げて 'with the whole country'). However, it is a verb phrase construction,
      whereas 「ぐるみ」 is a suffix. 「ぐるみ」 often emphasizes an inherent state or mode of being for the group,
      while 「〜を挙げて」 focuses more on the active mobilization or dedication of the group's resources or
      members.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:〜を挙げて (mobilizing all)
post_false_friends_writeup: While expressions like 「全部」, 「皆」, 「全体」, and 「〜を挙げて」 can convey a sense of
  totality or inclusion, 「ぐるみ」 specifically functions as a suffix attached to nouns (primarily) to denote
  the comprehensive involvement or unity of a group or entity in an action or state. It highlights that
  the action is performed 'as a whole' by that defined group, often carrying a nuance of shared responsibility
  or thoroughness.

        english: The whole family, everyone, went on a trip to Hawaii.
        hint: 「家族 みんなで」 emphasizes 'all members of the family.' While similar, 「家族ぐるみ」 specifically highlights

          a cohesive unit acting as a whole.
    scene: A family is discussing their past vacation.
    register: formal
    setting: friendly

          highlights the community's collective involvement.
    scene: A news report about a local environmental initiative.

          of the organization were involved.
        hint: 「組織の全員」 means 'all members of the organization.' 「組織ぐるみ」 implies a systemic, unified corruption
          that permeated the entire organization as a single entity, often with a negative connotation
          of conspiracy or widespread complicity. We're looking for an expression that emphasizes the
          entire organization's comprehensive and perhaps negative involvement.
