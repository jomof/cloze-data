jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Primarily used in formal or rigid contexts, such as legal, academic, or traditional settings,
    when strict adherence to established rules, laws, or customs is emphasized.
  function: Expresses strict compliance, conformity, or basing an action/thing upon a predefined standard,
    rule, or tradition.
  nuance: Implies a profound and often unyielding adherence to a foundational framework, often with historical
    or authoritative significance. It suggests a high degree of precision and strictness in following
    the specified rule.
etymology: The grammar point 「に則って」 originates from the classical Japanese verb 「則る (のっとる)」, which fundamentally
  means "to take as a model," "to follow," or "to conform to." The kanji 則 (のり) itself means "rule, law,
  model." This root concept of conforming to a prescribed standard or rule is central to its modern usage.
  The particle 「に」 marks the standard or rule being conformed to, while the 「～て」 form (則って) creates an
  adverbial phrase, indicating the manner in which an action is performed. The form 「に則り」 is the ます-stem
  of 「則る」, functioning as a conjunctive form (連用形 ren'yōkei) which often carries a more formal or written
  tone, and can also precede a noun to modify it. Both forms thus directly reflect the verb's core meaning
  of strict adherence to an established norm.
writeup: '「に則って」 and its more formal variant 「に則り」 are sophisticated expressions used to convey that an
  action or a thing is carried out or structured "according to," "in accordance with," or "based on" a
  specific established rule, law, tradition, or standard. This grammar point emphasizes a **strict and
  often unyielding adherence** to the prescribed framework. The "A" in the pattern "A に則って B" (where B
  is an action or state) typically refers to something with foundational, authoritative, or historical
  significance. This can include: **Legal frameworks:** Laws (法律), ordinances (条例), regulations (規定);
  **Official procedures:** Company policies (社内規定), procedural guidelines (手順), official protocols (儀式);
  **Established traditions:** Customs (慣習), historical practices (伝統), established etiquette (作法); **Ethical
  principles:** Codes of conduct (行動規範), moral principles (倫理). While both 「に則って」 (te-form) and 「に則り」
  (masu-stem) carry this formal meaning, 「に則り」 is often perceived as slightly more formal or literary,
  frequently appearing in written documents, official statements, or legal contexts. It can function adverbially
  to connect clauses or act attributively by modifying a subsequent noun when used with no particle (e.g.,
  規則に則り 決定する - "decide according to the rules"). The attributive past plain form 「に則った」 is also very common
  to describe something that *was* made or *is* structured according to a standard (e.g., 規則に則った 行動 -
  "an action in accordance with the rules"). It is important to understand that this grammar point implies
  a level of compliance that goes beyond mere alignment or general following. It suggests a precise and
  often non-negotiable conformity to a deeply ingrained or authoritative rule.'

  - term: に沿って
    meaning: Along, In accordance with, In line with
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While similar in meaning, 「に沿って」 often implies following a general direction, a plan, a route,
      or aligning with a policy. It suggests a less rigid adherence than 「に則って」, often allowing for some
      flexibility or interpretation, and can be used with more abstract concepts or less formal guidelines.
      It does not carry the strong sense of historical or foundational authority.
    grammar_point: に沿って (along)
  - term: にしたがって
    meaning: As, Following, According to, In accordance with
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「にしたがって」 is a more general expression for "following" or "obeying." It can denote a sequence
      of events, a natural progression, or simple obedience to instructions. It lacks the emphasis on
      strict adherence to a foundational rule or tradition that 「に則って」 carries, and can be used in much
      broader contexts, including describing a natural phenomenon or a personal decision.
    grammar_point: に従って・従い (in accordance with and proportional change)
  - term: に基づいて
    meaning: Based on, On the basis of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に基づいて」 implies that something is founded upon or derived from a certain basis, reason, or
      principle. While it suggests a strong connection to its foundation, it doesn't necessarily imply
      strict conformity to a *rule* or *protocol* in the same way 「に則って」 does. It's more about the source
      of information or justification, rather than strict procedural adherence.
    grammar_point: にもとづいて (based on)
  - term: に即して
    meaning: In accordance with, based on, in line with
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「に則る」 implies strict, often unyielding adherence to a foundational rule or principle,
      「に即して」 suggests conforming to practical circumstances, facts, or established norms. It can imply
      adapting to a situation or treating something in accordance with existing realities rather than
      rigidly following a set law.
    grammar_point: に即して (in accordance with)
  - term: に照らして
    meaning: In light of, based on, according to, referencing, comparing against, in view of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に照らして」 is used when evaluating or judging something *against* a standard or fact, like holding
      it up to a light to examine it. It implies comparing or checking for consistency, rather than the
      action itself *conforming* to a rule during its execution, as with 「に則る」.
    grammar_point: に照らして・に照らすと (in light of)
  - term: に準じて
    meaning: In conformity with, according to, based on (often by analogy or for non-specific rules)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「に準じて」 means to act or process something in a manner similar to or in accordance with a standard,
      even if the specific rules don't directly apply or are less formal. It implies following a pattern
      or treating things *as if* certain rules apply, which is less rigid and absolute than 「に則る」's strict
      adherence to established, formal laws or traditions.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:に準じて (in conformity with)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing among these expressions, consider the nature of the standard
  and the degree of adherence implied. 「に則って・に則り」 signifies strict, unyielding compliance with established,
  authoritative, often formal or historical rules, laws, or traditions—think of it as following a blueprint
  precisely. 「に沿って」 suggests aligning with a general direction, plan, or policy, implying a less rigid
  adherence with some flexibility. 「にしたがって」 is a broader term for "following" or "obeying," used for sequences,
  natural progressions, or simple instructions without emphasizing strictness. 「に基づいて」 means "based on"
  or "derived from," indicating the foundation or source of information, rather than a procedural adherence.
  「に即して」 implies conforming to practical circumstances or existing realities, often with a sense of adaptation.
  「に照らして」 is used for evaluating or judging something *against* a standard or fact, like comparison. Lastly,
  「に準じて」 implies following a standard by analogy or for less formal rules, suggesting a less absolute
  conformity.

        english: The sale of this product has been prohibited by means of the new law.
        hint: 「によって」 indicates the means or cause, but not the strict, unyielding adherence to the details
          of a law. We're looking for an expression that means strict compliance with a rule.
    scene: A government official is announcing a new regulation to the public.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「法律 に則って」 emphasizes that the prohibition is a direct, legally binding consequence
      of the new law, not merely a suggestion or a general guideline. This formal tone is appropriate
      for an official announcement. 「に則り」 (ni nottori) is a more formal variant often used in written
      or official contexts. 「に則った」 (ni nottotta) emphasizes the action being a *result* of the law.
    etymology: The term 「法律」 (hōritsu) combines 法 (hō, law) and 律 (ritsu, rhythm/rule), emphasizing the
      established, structured nature of laws. 「製品」 (seihin) combines 製 (sei, made) and 品 (hin, goods),
      simply meaning manufactured product. 「禁止」 (kinshi) means prohibition, combining 禁 (kin, prohibit)
      and 止 (shi, stop).

        english: Following our company's internal regulations, all business trip expenses will be reimbursed.
        hint: 「に従って」 often means simply "following" or "in accordance with," but 「に則って」 emphasizes a more

    register: bijinesu nihongo (business)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「社内 規定 に則り」 clearly states that the reimbursement is not discretionary but a mandatory
      procedure dictated by the company's formal regulations, typical in business communication, emphasizing
      clear, non-negotiable policies. 「に則って」 (ni nottotte) is also suitable and slightly less formal,
      while 「に則った 形 で」 (ni nottotta katachi de) emphasizes that the reimbursement takes a form that strictly
      adheres to the regulations.
    etymology: 「弊社」 (heisha) is a humble term for "our company," combining 弊 (hei, humble/my poor) and
      社 (sha, company). 「社内 規定」 (shanai kitei) refers to "internal company regulations," with 規定 meaning
      rules or stipulations. 「出張 費」 (shucchōhi) means "business trip expenses," combining 出張 (shucchō,
      business trip) and 費 (hi, expense). 「支給」 (shikyū) means payment or provision, typically for benefits
      or allowances.

          - この 祭り は 古い 伝統 に 基づい て、毎年 開催 さ れ て いる。
        english: This festival is held annually, based on ancient traditions.
        hint: 「に基づいて」 suggests being "based on" or "founded on," which is about the origin or rationale.
          However, 「に則った」 implies strict adherence to the *form* or *method* of the tradition itself.
          We're looking for precise execution according to tradition.
    scene: A cultural historian explains the significance of a local festival.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: 「伝統 に則った 形」 specifies that the festival's performance strictly adheres to the established,
      historical customs, ensuring its authenticity and continuity. This conveys a sense of respect for
      the past and the precision of the ritual. 「に則り」 (ni nottori) is a literary option implying the festival
      follows traditions directly, while 「に則って」 (ni nottotte) implies the festival is held *by* strictly
      following traditions.
    etymology: 「祭り」 (matsuri) refers to a festival or celebration, often rooted in religious or historical
      traditions. 「伝統」 (dentō) means tradition, combining 伝 (den, transmit) and 統 (tō, lineage/system).

        english: His behavior was criticized as something that was contrary to sportsmanship.
        hint: 「に反する」 means "contrary to" or "against," directly opposing a principle. 「に則らない」 implies
          a failure to *conform* to the principles, rather than actively going against them. We're looking
          for behavior that didn't align with the rules.
    scene: Two friends are discussing a recent controversial event in a sports game.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)

    nuance: The phrase 「スポーツマンシップ に則らない」 directly indicates a violation of the fundamental principles
      or rules of sportsmanship, implying a strong sense of ethical breach, even in a casual conversation
      about a sports event. 「に則っていなかった」 (ni nottotte inakatta) uses the negative progressive to express
      the same idea, emphasizing the ongoing lack of adherence.
    etymology: 「行動」 (kōdō) means action or behavior, combining 行 (kō, go) and 動 (dō, move). 「批判」 (hihan)
      means criticism, combining 批 (hi, criticize) and 判 (han, judgment). 「スポーツマンシップ」 (supōtsumanshippu)
      is a loanword directly from English "sportsmanship."

    nuance: When discussing 「倫理 規定 (ethical guidelines)」, 「に則って」 conveys that protecting privacy is a

      expected in academic and research settings. 「に則り」 (ni nottori) makes the statement even more formal,
      suitable for academic contexts. 「に則った 方法 で」 (ni nottotta hōhō de) specifies the *method* of protection
      adheres to the guidelines.

    nuance: The use of 「手順 に則り」 in a safety instruction emphasizes the absolute necessity of following
      every step of the official, established procedure to ensure safety and order during an emergency.
      This is crucial for clear, authoritative directives. 「に則って」 (ni nottotte) is a very close alternative
      in meaning and formality. 「に則った 行動 を お願いします」 (ni nottotta kōdō o onegaishimasu) simulates a polite
      request for actions that adhere to the procedures.
    etymology: 「緊急 事態」 (kinkyū jitai) means emergency situation, combining 緊急 (kinkyū, urgent) and 事態
      (jitai, situation). 「発生 時」 (hassei ji) means "at the time of occurrence," combining 発生 (hassei,

      and continuity. This implies a deeply ingrained and precise mastery. 「に則って 行われる 動き」 (ni nottotte
      okonawareru ugoki) emphasizes the *performance* of movements according to the etiquette. 「に則る 動き」

post_example_writeup: The various forms of 「に則る」—namely 「に則って」, 「に則り」, and 「に則った」—all function to express
  strict conformity. 「に則って」 and 「に則り」 are adverbial phrases that modify the verb or clause that follows,
  indicating that an action is carried out in precise accordance with the preceding noun (a rule, law,
  tradition, etc.). The form 「に則った」 is attributive, modifying a subsequent noun to describe it as something
  that has been made or is structured in adherence to a particular standard. The negative form 「に則らない」
  or 「に則らなかった」 is used to indicate a failure to comply or a deviation from such established standards.
