    "etymology": "The expression 「というところ」 literally translates to 「at the point of saying」. 「と」is a particle indicating content,「言う」means 'to say,' and「ところ」refers to a point or situation. It suggests the speaker is at a point where the following statement is an accurate, albeit approximate, assessment.",
    "writeup": "「というところ」 is a grammar expression used to highlight an approximate number or degree. It combines the particle 「と」, the verb 「言う」 ('to say'), and the noun 「ところ」 ('place'), which often marks situations. Common translations include \"I would say about (A)\" or \"I guess about (A).\" A more literal translation is \"To be at the point where saying (A) is accurate.\" This structure commonly follows verbs or nouns but can occasionally follow adjectives. Typically appearing at the end of sentences, 「というところ」 will often be immediately followed by the auxiliary verb 「だ」 or 「です」. Sometimes, 「という」 is replaced by the past-tense form, 「といった」, without changing the meaning. Be cautious, as 「というところ」 is often used when the number given is the theoretical maximum, so it might sound unnatural when presenting an approximate minimum.",
