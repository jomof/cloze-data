    "etymology": "The expression 「というところ」 is derived from 「と言う」 (to say) and 「ところ」 (place, point). The literal sense is \"it's at the point where saying X is accurate.\"",
    "writeup": "「というところ」 is a grammar expression used to highlight an approximate number or degree for something. It combines the particle 「と」, the verb 「言う」 (to say), and the noun 「ところ」 (place), which often marks situations. Common translations include \"I would say about (A)\" or \"I guess about (A).\" A more literal translation would be, \"To be at the point where saying (A) is accurate\".\n\nIt most commonly appears following verbs or nouns but can occasionally follow adjectives. Typically found at the end of sentences, 「というところ」 is often immediately followed by the auxiliary verb 「だ」 or 「です」. Occasionally, 「という」 is replaced by the past-tense form, 「といった」. The meaning remains unchanged in these instances.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n*   「というところ」 tends to be used when the number given is the theoretical maximum rather than the minimum. Therefore, it may sound unnatural when presenting an approximate minimum.",

While 'でしょう' also expresses conjecture, 'というところ' emphasizes that 'about two weeks' is the specific point or range of estimation, often implying a 'best case' or a 'this is where we're at' nuance, which is suited to project updates."
