    "etymology": "「なぜなら」 is a conjunction combining 「なぜ」(why) and the hypothetical form 「なら」 of 「だ」 (to be). Literally, it translates to \"if you ask why.\" The 「から」 at the end reinforces the reason being given.",
    "writeup": "The pattern 「なぜなら〜から」 is used to emphasize the reason for a statement. 「なぜなら」 acts as a conjunction that introduces the reason, and 「から」 concludes the explanation. Think of it as highlighting the \"because\" part of your sentence.\n\nTo use it, state your main point (A), then begin the next sentence with 「なぜなら」 followed by the reason (B), ending with 「から」. This structure draws the listener's attention and indicates that an important explanation is coming.",
