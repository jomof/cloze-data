    "etymology": "The auxiliary verbs 「せる」and 「させる」originate from the classical Japanese verb 「為す(なす)」, meaning \"to do\" or \"to make\". Over time, it evolved to express the concept of causing or allowing someone to perform an action. The distinction between 「せる」and 「させる」depends on the verb group they are attached to, reflecting different phonetic changes during the language's development.",
    "writeup": "To express that someone was \"made to do\" or \"let do\" something, the auxiliary verbs せる and させる are used. This meaning is called 使役 (shieki, causative) in Japanese. It's important to remember that these are auxiliary verbs with their own meaning, similar to how たい, ない, だ, です, and other auxiliaries function.\n\n*   **る-Verbs:** Remove the る and add させる.\n*   **う-Verbs:** Change the last kana to the あ-sound kana from the same column (う becomes わ) and then add せる (e.g., る becomes ら, む becomes ま, く becomes か).\n*   **する** is replaced by させる (like できる replaces する in the potential form).\n*   **来る (kuru)** becomes 来させる (kosaseru).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   In causative sentences, the 'doer' of the action can be marked with either に or を (not が). に usually implies 'let' do something, while を implies 'make'. For example:\n    *   (A) が (B) に 楽しませる - For (A) to cause fun 'in' (B).\n    *   (A) が (B) を 楽しませる - For (A) to cause fun 'through' (B).",
