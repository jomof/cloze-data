    "etymology": "The auxiliary verbs 「せる」 and 「させる」 are derived from older forms of causative verbs in classical Japanese. 「せる」 comes from 「しむ」 (shimu), and 「させる」 comes from 「しめさす」 (shimesasu), both meaning \"to cause to do.\" Over time, these evolved into the modern forms 「せる」 and 「させる」, retaining their causative meaning.",
    "writeup": "To express that someone was \"made to do\" or \"let do\" something, the auxiliary verbs 「せる」 and 「させる」 are used. This meaning is called 使役 (shieki), meaning \"causative\" or \"employment.\" It's important to understand that 「せる」 and 「させる」 are auxiliary verbs with their own meanings, similar to how 「たい」, 「ない」, 「だ」, and 「です」 each have their own meanings.\n\n*   **Conjugation:**\n    *   る-Verbs: Remove the 「る」 and add 「させる」.\n    *   う-Verbs: Change the last kana to the corresponding あ-sound kana (except 「う」 becomes 「わ」), and then add 「せる」 (e.g., 「る」 becomes 「ら」, 「む」 becomes 「ま」, 「く」 becomes 「か」).\n    *   する: Replaced by 「させる」.\n    *   来る: Becomes 「来させる」 (kosaseru).\n\n*   **Particle Usage:** With causative verbs, either 「に」 or 「を」 can mark the doer of the action. 「に」 usually implies \"let\" someone do something, while 「を」 implies \"make\" someone do something.\n\n*   **Literal Translation:** Because the actual 'doer' in causative verb sentences will be marked with 「が」, the literal translation of 「せる」 and 「させる」 is closer to:\n    *   (A) が (B) に 楽しませる - For (A) to cause fun 'in' (B).\n    *   (A) が (B) を 楽しませる - For (A) to cause fun 'through' (B).",
