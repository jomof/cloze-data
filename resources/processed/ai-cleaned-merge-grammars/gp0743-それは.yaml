    "writeup": "「それは」is an interjection used in conversational Japanese to express strong agreement or affirmation. It conveys a sense of \"naturally,\" \"of course,\" or \"surely.\" The speaker uses 「それは」when the statement or question being responded to is something obvious or expected. It's a way to emphasize that the speaker's answer is the only logical one. This phrase is primarily used in spoken language and adds a layer of emphasis to the response.",
    "etymology": "「それ」refers to 'that,' and 「は」is the topic marker. In this context, 「それは」implies 'that is (obviously the case)' or 'that is what one would expect.'",
