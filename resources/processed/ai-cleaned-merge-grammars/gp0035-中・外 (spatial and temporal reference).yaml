details:
  part-of-speech: noun
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to denote spatial relationships (inside/outside) and temporal states (during/in
    the middle of).
  function: Functions as a noun or adverbial modifier, indicating location or ongoing action.
  nuance: 「中」 can imply either literal interior space or an ongoing process. 「外」 strictly refers to exterior
    space. The specific usage depends on context.
etymology: The kanji 中 (naka) originally depicted an arrow piercing the center of a target, symbolizing
  'middle' or 'interior.' The kanji 外 (soto) is believed to have evolved from a pictograph of a person
  standing outside a gate, representing 'outside' or 'exterior.' Their roles as spatial indicators are
  deeply rooted in these ancient visual representations.
writeup: |-
  The Japanese words **中 (naka)** and **外 (soto)** are fundamental for expressing spatial relationships. **中 (naka)** primarily means "inside" or "middle," and it can be used for both physical spaces and more abstract concepts like being "in the middle of" an action or a period of time. For example, 「箱 の 中」 means "inside the box," while 「食事 中」 means "during a meal" or "in the middle of eating."

  **外 (soto)** means "outside" or "exterior." It is generally used for physical spaces outside of something. For instance, 「家 の 外」 means "outside the house."

  It's important to pay attention to how **中** is used with verbs. When attached to the **dictionary form of a verb**, it signifies that an action is currently in progress, similar to the English "-ing" form. For example, 「走る 中」 would mean "while running" or "in the middle of running." When **中** follows a noun, it often denotes a state of being *during* a particular period or event, such as 「会議 中」 ("during the meeting").

  The usage of **中 (naka)** can be quite versatile, extending beyond simple physical location to encompass temporal states and abstract contexts. Understanding the core meaning of "middle" or "interior" helps connect these various uses.

  - term: うち (uchi)
    meaning: inside (often refers to one's own home or group)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While **中 (naka)** refers to the general interior of any space, **うち (uchi)** often implies
      the interior of one's own space, like one's home or inside one's own group/company. It has a more
      personal or belonging connotation.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:うち (one's own)
  - term: 間 (aida)
    meaning: between, during, interval
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: '**間 (aida)** denotes an interval *between* two points or actions, or a period *during* which
      something happens, emphasizing the duration. **中 (naka)** focuses on being *within* a larger context
      or *in the middle of* an ongoing state, rather than an interval between two distinct points.'

  - term: 上 (ue)
    meaning: on, above
    kind: antonym
    nuance: '**上 (ue)** indicates a position *above* or *on top of* something, directly contrasting with
      **中 (naka)** which signifies *inside* or *within*.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:上,下 (vertical spatial)
  - term: 下 (shita)
    meaning: under, below
    kind: antonym
    nuance: '**下 (shita)** indicates a position *below* or *under* something, forming another direct spatial
      contrast with **中 (naka)**.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:上,下 (vertical spatial)
  - term: 以内 (inai)
    meaning: within (a limit, range, or period)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While **中 (naka)** refers to a general interior space or being *in the middle of* something,
      **以内 (inai)** specifically denotes being *within a defined limit, boundary, or period*, often implying
      compliance or a constraint. It emphasizes the scope or range.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:以内 (within a limit)
  - term: 以外 (igai)
    meaning: other than, besides, except for
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Whereas **外 (soto)** refers to the physical exterior of something, **以外 (igai)** is used to
      mean 'other than,' 'besides,' or 'except for' a specific category or item. It functions more conceptually
      to exclude items from a set rather than indicating a physical location.
    grammar_point: 以外 (except)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between **中 (naka)** and **うち (uchi)**, remember that
  **うち (uchi)** often carries a sense of belonging or being part of one's own sphere, whereas **中 (naka)**
  is more neutral and simply refers to the interior space. For instance, you would say 「家 の 中」 for 'inside
  the house' in general, but 「うち の 中」 if you mean 'inside *my* house' with a sense of personal connection.
  As for **間 (aida)**, think of it as the space *between* things or the *duration* of an event, while
  **中 (naka)** is more about being *within* something or *in the midst* of an ongoing state. Regarding
  **以内 (inai)** and **以外 (igai)**, these particles delineate *boundaries* or *exclusions*. **以内 (inai)**
  specifies being *within a defined limit or range*, often relating to time, quantity, or scope, whereas
  **中 (naka)** denotes a more general 'inside' or 'during' an ongoing state. Conversely, **以外 (igai)**
  indicates 'everything but' a specified item or category, functioning to *exclude*, while **外 (soto)**
  simply means 'outside' a physical boundary.

post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, **中 (naka)** and **外 (soto)** are quite versatile.
  Remember that **中 (naka)** can refer to both literal interior space and an ongoing state, while **外
  (soto)** is strictly about exterior space. Paying close attention to the context will help you choose
  the correct word and nuance.
