etymology: The etymology of 「どうも」 is complex, tracing back to older Japanese where 「どう」 meant "how" or
  "in what way," and 「も」 added emphasis. Over time, it evolved to express various nuanced meanings, including
  uncertainty, difficulty, or general acknowledgement.
writeup: |-
  「どうも」 is a highly versatile Japanese adverb with multiple meanings and usages, often implying a sense of ambiguity, difficulty, or a general acknowledgment. Its precise meaning is heavily dependent on context and the surrounding words. It can be used to express:

  *   **Difficulty or inability:** When paired with a negative verb or adjective, 「どうも」 indicates that something is not going well, is difficult to achieve, or cannot be done easily, often implying a subtle, almost unexplainable, resistance. For example, 「{どうも}分からない」 implies "I just can't quite understand it, for some reason." or "I'm having trouble understanding it."
  *   **Conjecture or impression:** When followed by expressions like 「らしい」 or 「ようだ」, 「どうも」 suggests a strong impression, hunch, or conjecture based on indirect evidence. For example, 「{どうも}疲れているようだ」 means "It seems like they're tired, for some reason" or "I get the impression they're tired."

  - term: どうもありがとう
    meaning: Thank you very much

      gratitude, not implying uncertainty or an inexplicable reason.
    grammar_point: どうも (thanks・sorry・hello)
  - term: どうもすみません
    meaning: I'm very sorry
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「どうも (somehow・for some reason)」, 「どうもすみません」 is a direct and specific expression of
      apology, not implying uncertainty or an inexplicable reason.
    grammar_point: どうも (thanks・sorry・hello)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「どうも」 by itself can be a very versatile expression for gratitude, apology,
  or greeting when used alone in context (this is covered by the grammar point "どうも (thanks・sorry・hello)").
  However, when combined with 「ありがとう」 or 「すみません」, the meaning is a more specific expression of thanks
  or apology. This grammar point 「どうも (somehow・for some reason)」 focuses on its use to convey uncertainty,
  difficulty, or an inexplicable cause.

      a degree of uncertainty or an unexplainable feeling about the observation, as if saying, "I can't
      quite put my finger on it, but..."

    speaker_age: older
    nuance: When used with sensory perceptions like 「匂い が する」, 「どうも」 implies a vague or uncertain perception,

      confirmation or shared acknowledgment from the listener.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, the versatile nature of 「どうも」 allows it to express
  a range of nuances from vague uncertainty to emphasized emotion, depending heavily on the accompanying
  phrases, context, and speaker's tone. Recognizing these patterns and the situations in which 「どうも」 is
  used will greatly enhance your understanding and natural use of this common Japanese expression.
