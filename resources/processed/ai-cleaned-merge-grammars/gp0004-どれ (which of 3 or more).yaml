meaning: which one (of three or more)
pronunciation:
  katakana: ドレ
  romaji: dore
formation:
  どれ + Verb/Copula: Indicates an interrogative pronoun used independently.
  どれ + の + Noun: While grammatically possible, it is less common as 「どの Noun」 is generally preferred for
    directly modifying a noun.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The interrogative series こ・そ・あ・ど (kosoado) pronouns derive from old Japanese demonstratives.
  「ど」 stems from an older interrogative form that asked "where" or "which". 「どれ」 combines this interrogative
  stem with the general referential particle 「れ」, indicating a "thing" or "item". Thus, it evolved to
  mean "which thing" or "which one."
writeup: 「どれ」 is an interrogative pronoun used to ask "which one?" when there are three or more options
  or when the number of options is unknown but implied to be more than two. It functions similarly to
  English "which one" or "which of them." Unlike 「どちら」 which specifically refers to a choice between two
  distinct items or directions, 「どれ」 is used for selection from a larger group. It can stand alone or
  be followed by a copula like 「です」 or 「だ」. While 「どの」 is an interrogative determiner that directly modifies
  a noun (e.g., 「どの本」 - which book), 「どれ」 acts as a pronoun, substituting for the noun itself. It is a
  fundamental interrogative word and is widely used across all registers, though the politeness level
  will depend on the accompanying particles or verb conjugations.

  - term: どちら
    meaning: Which one (of two options); which way (polite)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「どちら」 is specifically used when choosing between two clearly defined options or asking for
      a direction in a polite manner. 「どれ」 is for three or more, or an unspecified large group.
    grammar_point: どちら (which way, formal)
  - term: この・その・あの・どの
    meaning: Which (modifies a noun)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どの」 is an adjectival determiner that must be followed by a noun (e.g., 「どの本」). 「どれ」 is a
      pronoun and stands alone or is followed by a particle/copula.
    grammar_point: この (this)
  - term: 何
    meaning: What
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「何」 asks "what" generally, 「どれ」 specifically asks "which one" from a given set. For
      example, if you see a row of cakes, you'd ask 「どれですか？」 (Which one is it?) not necessarily 「何ですか？」
      (What is it?), unless you don't know what kind of things they are at all.
    grammar_point: 何 (what)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the distinction between 「どれ」, 「どちら」, and 「どの」 is crucial for
  precise communication. Remember, 「どちら」 is exclusively for a choice between two, and it carries a polite
  nuance. 「どれ」 is for a selection from three or more items. 「どの」 always precedes a noun to specify "which
  Noun." 「何」 is a broader interrogative for "what," whereas 「どれ」 implies a selection from visible or implied
  options.
