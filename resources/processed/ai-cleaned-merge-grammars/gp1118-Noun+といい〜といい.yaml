        "Noun1 + といい + Noun2 + といい": "Used to list two distinct nouns or aspects that contribute to an overall evaluation or impression."

        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "function": "To present multiple aspects or perspectives that lead to an overall judgment or evaluation, whether positive or negative.",
        "nuance": "This grammar pattern emphasizes that the speaker's overall assessment of something is based on multiple, specific qualities or aspects. It implies a comprehensive evaluation rather than merely listing items. The nuance conveyed is often one of thoroughness in judgment, highlighting how different factors contribute to a single conclusion.",
        "counterpoint": "This structure is distinct from simply listing with 「〜も〜も」, as 「〜も〜も」 enumerates items without necessarily implying a comprehensive evaluation of all listed aspects contributing to an overall judgment."
    },
    "etymology": "The origin of 「〜といい〜といい」 combines the conjunctive particle 「と」 (meaning 'and' or 'with') and 「いい」, the dictionary form of the adjective 「良い (yoi)」, meaning 'good' or 'well'. Thus, literally translating to 'this is good and that is good,' the phrase evolved to express that multiple aspects contribute to a comprehensive judgment or impression, whether positive or negative. The repetition emphasizes the consideration of each element.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「Noun + といい〜といい」 is used to articulate an overall impression or judgment by highlighting two or more specific aspects or qualities. It functions to say, \"considering both X and Y,\" implying that the evaluation is thorough and takes these factors into account. This construction is typically used in more formal or reflective contexts where a comprehensive assessment is being made. While it often appears in situations where the overall judgment is positive, it can also be used for negative evaluations, as long as the listed aspects uniformly contribute to that negative conclusion.",
