    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Noun+といい〜といい」 is used to express that something is being evaluated from multiple perspectives, and it's good (or bad) from all of those viewpoints. It's a way to list characteristics or aspects to emphasize an overall impression. Think of it as saying \"in terms of both X and Y...\" or \"considering X as well as Y...\"  For example, 「味といい、香りといい、このコーヒーは最高だ」 means \"in terms of both taste and aroma, this coffee is the best.\"",
    "etymology": "The 「と」 particle here can be thought of as similar to \"and\" or \"as well as.\"  「いい」 means \"good\" or \"well.\" So, the structure essentially says \"both this *and* that are good,\" presenting multiple positive (or negative) attributes.",
