        "Noun1 + といい + Noun2 + といい": "Used to list two distinct nouns or aspects that contribute to an overall evaluation or impression."
    },
    "jlpt": "N2",
    "meaning": "In terms of both ~ and ~; in terms of ~ as well as ~; from the perspective of both ~ and ~",
    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "function": "To present multiple aspects or perspectives that lead to an overall judgment or evaluation, whether positive or negative.",
        "nuance": "This grammar pattern emphasizes that the speaker's overall assessment of something is based on multiple, specific qualities or aspects. It implies a comprehensive evaluation rather than merely listing items. The nuance conveyed is often one of thoroughness in judgment, highlighting how different factors contribute to a single conclusion.",
        "counterpoint": "This structure is distinct from simply listing with 「〜も〜も」, as 「〜も〜も」 enumerates items without necessarily implying a comprehensive evaluation of all listed aspects contributing to an overall judgment."
    },
    "etymology": "The origin of 「〜といい〜といい」 combines the conjunctive particle 「と」 (meaning 'and' or 'with') and 「いい」, the dictionary form of the adjective 「良い (yoi)」, meaning 'good' or 'well'. Thus, literally translating to 'this is good and that is good,' the phrase evolved to express that multiple aspects contribute to a comprehensive judgment or impression, whether positive or negative. The repetition emphasizes the consideration of each element.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「Noun + といい〜といい」 is used to articulate an overall impression or judgment by highlighting two or more specific aspects or qualities. It functions to say, \"considering both X and Y,\" implying that the evaluation is thorough and takes these factors into account. This construction is typically used in more formal or reflective contexts where a comprehensive assessment is being made. While it often appears in situations where the overall judgment is positive, it can also be used for negative evaluations, as long as the listed aspects uniformly contribute to that negative conclusion.",
    "examples": [
        {
            "japanese": "この レストラン は {味 といい} {サービス といい}、いつも 期待 を 裏切ら ない。",
            "english": "This restaurant, in terms of both taste and service, never disappoints.",
            "english_literally": "This restaurant, both its taste and its service, always does not betray expectations.",
            "scene": "A person enthusiastically recommending a restaurant to a friend, emphasizing its consistent quality.",
            "register": "teineigo (polite)",
            "setting": "friendly",
            "speaker_gender": "female",
            "listener_gender": "female",
            "nuance": "This sentence is suitable for any gender or age. The use of 「〜といい〜といい」 emphasizes a comprehensive positive evaluation of the restaurant, implying that multiple factors (taste and service) contribute to its consistent quality. 「期待を裏切らない」 is a common expression for reliably meeting expectations, applicable in various contexts."

        {
            "japanese": "彼女 は {話し方 といい} {笑顔 といい}、周り の 人 を 引きつける。",

            "setting": "friendly",
            "speaker_gender": "male",
            "listener_gender": "male",
            "nuance": "The informal tone created by the lack of polite endings and the direct reference to her positive attributes makes this suitable for a casual conversation between friends. 「引きつける」 (to attract) is a neutral verb often used to describe someone's captivating presence, and fits well in this context of admiration."
        },
        {
            "japanese": "今回 の プロジェクト は {計画性 といい} {実行力 といい}、まさに 文句なし でした。",

            "speaker_gender": "female",
            "listener_gender": "group",
            "nuance": "The use of 「文句なし」 (literally 'no complaints') in a business context conveys a strong, definitive approval, implying that there is absolutely nothing to criticize. The formal ending 「でした」 maintains professionalism. This reflects a thorough, well-reasoned assessment of the project's success, highlighting its strengths in planning and execution."

            "japanese": "あの チーム は {チームワーク といい} {集中力 といい}、最近 全く ダメ だ。",
            "english": "That team, in terms of both teamwork and focus, has been absolutely terrible recently.",
            "english_literally": "That team, both its teamwork and its focus, recently is completely useless.",
            "scene": "A man is complaining to his friend about the poor performance of his favorite sports team.",
            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "serious",
            "speaker_gender": "male",
            "listener_gender": "male",
            "nuance": "The phrase 「全く ダメ だ」 is a blunt, casual expression indicating complete failure, commonly used by male speakers in informal settings to express frustration or strong negative opinions. This sentence uses 「〜といい〜といい」 to explain that the team's poor performance is attributable to multiple contributing factors: their lack of teamwork and focus."

            "speaker_gender": "female",
            "listener_gender": "male",
            "nuance": "The phrase 「理解しやすかった です」 (it was easy to understand) is a polite and appropriate way to give feedback in an academic setting. The use of 「〜といい〜といい」 frames the positive evaluation of the presentation as a result of its well-structured content and logical organization, making the compliment more precise and impactful."

            "nuance": "「まさに 理想的 だ」 (truly ideal) conveys strong enthusiasm and satisfaction, fitting for someone excited about a new purchase. By using 「〜といい〜といい」, the speaker highlights that both the aesthetic (design) and practical (comfort) aspects contribute to the overall ideal quality of the shoes."

    ],
    "post_example_writeup": "The core of 「〜といい〜といい」 lies in its ability to combine two distinct (often contrasting but consistently contributing) aspects into a single, cohesive evaluation. It allows for a nuanced judgment, indicating that the overall conclusion is supported by a comprehensive consideration of the listed elements.",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「〜といい〜といい」, 「〜も〜も」 simply lists multiple items without necessarily implying an evaluation or judgment across those aspects. It focuses on inclusion rather than comprehensive assessment, and can be used in a wider variety of contexts."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「〜も〜も」 can also list multiple items (e.g., 「味もサービスも」 - both taste and service), it lacks the evaluative nuance inherent in 「〜といい〜といい」. Use 「〜といい〜といい」 when you want to convey that an overall assessment is being made *because of* (or in consideration of) the listed aspects, implying a judgment based on these specific points. Use 「〜も〜も」 when you simply want to state that multiple things are true or apply, without necessarily tying them to a singular overarching evaluation.",
