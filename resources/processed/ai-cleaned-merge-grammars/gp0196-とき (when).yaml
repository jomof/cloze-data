etymology: The word 「時 (とき)」 directly translates to "time" in Japanese. Its usage as a temporal conjunction
  evolved from its core meaning, allowing it to specify the exact moment or period during which an action
  or state takes place. It acts as a pivot, connecting a preceding clause that describes the condition
  or event (what is happening or was happening) with a following clause that describes what occurs at
  that time.
writeup: |-
  「とき」 (時 in kanji) functions as a dependent noun meaning "when" or "at the time of." It is used to describe actions or states that occur at specific times or during certain events. 「とき」 is notably versatile, applicable to both recurring events (habits, routines) and unique, single occurrences. For example, 「雨 が 降る **とき**」 (when it rains) describes a general condition, while 「あの 映画 を 見た **とき**」 (when I watched that movie) refers to a specific past event.

  To use 「とき」, you attach it to the end of a clause. The form of the word preceding 「とき」 depends on its part of speech:
  *   **Verbs**: Attach directly to the plain form (dictionary form, ta-form, or te-iru form). For instance, 「食べる **とき**」 (when eating) or 「食べた **とき**」 (when I ate).
  *   **い-adjectives**: Attach directly to the adjective. For example, 「寒い **とき**」 (when it's cold).
  *   **な-adjectives**: Add 「な」 before 「とき」. For example, 「静か な **とき**」 (when it's quiet).
  *   **Nouns**: Add 「の」 before 「とき」. For example, 「学生 の **とき**」 (when I was a student).

  The particle 「に」 can optionally follow 「とき」, especially when the following clause describes a single, specific action occurring at that time. For instance, 「駅 に 着く **とき** に 電話 し て ください。」 (Please call me when you arrive at the station.) While 「に」 is optional, its inclusion often emphasizes the specific moment of occurrence.

  - term: 際に
    meaning: When, at the time of, in case of, on the occasion of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「際に」 (sai ni) is more formal and often used in written or official contexts, whereas 「とき」
      is more general and versatile for everyday speech and writing. 「際に」 often implies a more significant
      or specific occasion than 「とき」 does, like 'on the occasion of a major event'.
    grammar_point: 際に・折に・に当たって・に際して (on the occasion of・when)
  - term: と同時に
    meaning: At the same time as, the instant, the moment, as well as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「と同時に」 (to douji ni) indicates actions happening strictly simultaneously, emphasizing the
      very moment two things occur together, whereas 「とき」 simply indicates one action happening during
      a time frame or at a specific point in time without necessarily being precisely simultaneous down
      to the instant. It can also mean 'as well as'.
    grammar_point: と同時に (at the same time as)
  - term: の間に
    meaning: While, during, between, period
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「の間に」 (no aida ni) emphasizes the duration of an action or state within a specified period,
      implying something happens *during* a continuous activity. In contrast, 「とき」 focuses on a specific
      point in time or a broader timeframe when something occurs, without necessarily implying an ongoing
      action throughout the entire period outlined by 'とき'.
    grammar_point: あいだ (between・among・while・during)
  - term: 中
    meaning: During, while, throughout, in the process of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「中」 (naka) indicates an ongoing state, process, or a duration. It typically suggests that
      an action is continuous or occurs *throughout* a specified period. 「とき」, while also indicating time,
      specifies a particular moment or event within time, or a broader period during which something generally
      happens, but not necessarily continuously 'throughout'.
    grammar_point: 中 (duration・entirety)
  - term: 最中に
    meaning: In the middle of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「最中に」 (saichuu ni) indicates that something happens abruptly in the very middle of another
      action, often implying an unexpected interruption or occurrence at the peak of an activity. 「とき」
      is a more neutral temporal indicator, simply stating 'when' something occurs without the connotation
      of interruption or being 'right in the middle' of something specific in an abrupt way.
    grammar_point: 最中に (in the middle of)
  - term: ながら
    meaning: While doing ~ing, during, as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ながら」 (nagara) implies two actions are performed simultaneously by the same subject. It specifically
      means 'while doing X, also doing Y.' 「とき」 simply indicates that one thing happens when another is
      the case, without requiring strict simultaneity or a single subject performing both actions. It
      focuses on the time frame, not the dual action.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]ながら・つつ (while doing)'
  - term: ているあいだに
    meaning: While, during the time that ~
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ているあいだに」 (te iru aida ni) indicates a period of time during which something happens, often
      implying a change or completion by the end of that period. It emphasizes the duration and that something
      new occurs within that span. 「とき」 specifies a particular moment or occasion without necessarily
      emphasizing the continuous duration or a change occurring within that duration.
    grammar_point: あいだ (between・among・while・during)
  - term: ているところだ
    meaning: In the process of doing ~ right now/at this moment
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ているところだ」 (te iru tokoro da) emphasizes the precise current action in progress, indicating
      that something is happening at this very moment or is about to begin/just finished. 「とき」 simply
      refers to the general time of an event or state, not necessarily the exact point of an action's
      initiation or completion.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-て]いるところだ (in the process of doing)'
  - term: うちに
    meaning: While, during, before (a change occurs)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「うちに」 (uchi ni) suggests taking advantage of a limited time frame or opportunity, or that
      a change occurs naturally during a period, often implying a sense of urgency or impermanence. 「とき」
      is a more neutral indicator of time without these specific connotations of limitation or internal
      change.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary・い-Adj・な-Adj・Nounの]うちに (while a state continues)'
  - term: '[Verb-dictionary]ことがある (there are times when)'
    meaning: Sometimes, occasionally, there are times when
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ことがある」 (koto ga aru) indicates an occasional occurrence or a possibility, describing something
      that happens from time to time. While 「とき」 can describe general occurrences, it focuses on the time
      itself, whereas 「ことがある」 focuses on the *frequency* or *existence* of such occurrences.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]ことがある (there are times when)'
  - term: ごろ
    meaning: Around, about
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ごろ」 (goro) indicates an approximate time for a point in time or a period. It's used for estimations
      like 'around 3 o'clock.' 「とき」, while flexible, implies a more specific moment or period relative
      to an action or state, rather than just an approximate time.
    grammar_point: ごろ (approximate time)
  - term: 折には
    meaning: On the occasion of; When the opportunity arises; When
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「折には」 (ori ni wa) is a more polite and somewhat formal expression used to indicate a specific
      occasion or opportunity. It carries a nuance of a suitable or special moment. 「とき」 is a more general
      and common term for time, without the added formality or sense of a special occasion.
    grammar_point: 際に・折に・に当たって・に際して (on the occasion of・when)
post_false_friends_writeup: When selecting among expressions that convey 'when' or 'at the time of,' it
  is crucial to consider the precise context and nuance. Factors such as the desired level of formality,
  whether actions are simultaneous or sequential, the emphasis on a specific moment versus a duration,
  and whether the event is sudden or expected, all influence the most appropriate choice. Careful attention
  to these subtle differences will lead to precise and natural Japanese.

          - 疲れ {たら} 甘い もの が 食べ たく なる
        english: If I get tired, I feel like eating something sweet.
        hint: The scene emphasizes a recurring tendency rather than a strict conditional. 'とき' here suggests
          'whenever' or 'on occasions when', which fits the habit better than '{たら}' which implies a direct
          consequence.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: While I'm tired, I feel like eating something sweet, you know?

        english: As I get tired, I start to feel like eating something sweet, you know?
        hint: 「{うちに}」 often implies a change that occurs naturally during a period, or an action taken
          before a condition changes. We're stating a recurring tendency, not a change that happens *during*
          tiredness or an action to be taken.

    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The casual ending particle 「ね」 at the end of the sentence is frequently used by female speakers
      to seek agreement or share a personal observation in a gentle manner, fitting a reflective setting.
      「〜なるね」 makes the statement sound conversational and relatable, common in casual speech among friends
      or family, regardless of gender. However, this phrasing carries a slightly more feminine tone when
      used to express a general, soft observation like this. A male speaker might use just 「〜なる」 or 「〜なるよ」
      but 「〜なるね」 can also be used by men in intimate or very casual contexts.

        hint: The scene describes a past state or period of life, which 'とき' is ideally suited for. '{だったら}'
          implies a hypothetical or a past condition, not the specific duration of being a student.

        english: On the occasion of being a student, I could use my time more freely, couldn't I?
        hint: 「{際に}」 is more formal and used for specific, often significant, occasions. Here, we're reflecting
          on a general period of life, which 「とき」 describes more naturally.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 学生 の {間 に}、もっと 自由 に 時間 を 使え た な。
        english: 「{の間に}」 emphasizes the duration of an action or state within a specified period. While
          grammatically possible, 「とき」 focuses on the period *when* one was a student, implying a state
          rather than an ongoing action throughout the entire period.
        hint: 「{の間に}」 emphasizes the duration of an action or state within a specified period. While grammatically
          possible, 「とき」 focuses on the period *when* one was a student, implying a state rather than

          is a general reflection on a period of life, making 「とき」 more appropriate.

    nuance: The particle 「な」 at the end of the sentence adds a sense of personal reflection or mild nostalgia,
      commonly used by male speakers when reminiscing. The phrasing 「〜時間を使えたな」 suggests a wistful look
      back at a time when things were different. This makes the sentence natural for an older male speaker
      sharing his past experiences with a younger person, regardless of gender, but often heard when an
      older male is talking to a younger woman.

        hint: The scene sets a specific condition for an action. 'とき' here indicates the specific time

          pinpoints this past moment, differentiating it from '{たら}', which can imply a more general sequence
          or a hypothetical outcome, although '{たら}' could also be used here depending on the subtle nuance

        english: Right in the middle of going abroad for the first time, I was really moved.
        hint: 「{最中 に}」 implies an abrupt occurrence *in the very middle* of an action, often an interruption.

          that prompts seeking advice, not just that trouble sometimes happens.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 困っ た {折 に は}、いつ で も 私 に 相談 し て ください ね。
        english: On the occasion of being troubled, please consult me anytime, okay?
        hint: 「{折には}」 is a more polite and formal expression for a specific occasion or opportunity. This
          is a general, standing offer, making 「とき」 more appropriate.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 困る {と}、いつ で も 私 に 相談 し て ください ね。
        english: When you get troubled, please consult me anytime, okay?
        hint: 「〜る{と}」 indicates a direct, often automatic, consequence that regularly follows a condition.
          We're looking for a general condition or occasion for seeking advice.
    scene: A kind senior colleague offering help to a junior colleague.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: supportive
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The use of the polite imperative 「相談してください」 combined with the soft ending particle 「ね」 shows
      both respect and concern. This phrasing is common in a workplace setting where a senior offers help
      to a junior. While gender-neutral, the supportive tone makes it appropriate for addressing a group
      of colleagues or a general audience implicitly, emphasizing an inclusive offer of assistance.
  - english: During the entrance ceremony, I was so nervous my legs were shaking.
    japanese:
      - 入学 式 の {とき}、緊張 し て 足 が 震え た よ。
      - 入学 式 の {とき}、緊張 し て 足 が 震え まし た。
      - 入学 式 の {とき}、緊張 し て 足 が 震え た ぜ。
      - 入学 式 の {とき}、緊張 し て 足 が 震え た。
    english_literally: Entrance ceremony's time, nervous became and legs shook, you know.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 入学 式 {だっ たら} 緊張 し て 足 が 震え た
        english: If it were the entrance ceremony, I would have been nervous and my legs would have shaken.
        hint: The scene refers to a specific, unique event in the past. 'とき' precisely indicates the moment
          of the entrance ceremony as the context for the nervousness, making it clear it was a past,
          real experience rather than a hypothetical 'if it were the entrance ceremony'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 入学 式 の {際 に}、緊張 し て 足 が 震え た よ。
        english: On the occasion of the entrance ceremony, I was so nervous my legs were shaking.
        hint: 「{際に}」 is more formal and typically used for specific, significant occasions. While an entrance
          ceremony is significant, 「とき」 is more commonly used for personal, casual recollections.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 入学 式 の {間 に}、緊張 し て 足 が 震え た よ。
        english: 「{の間に}」 emphasizes duration within which something occurs. While grammatically similar,
          「とき」 simply denotes the time of the event, whereas 「{の間に}」 highlights the continuous period
          during which the nervousness was felt.
        hint: 「{の間に}」 emphasizes duration within which something occurs. While grammatically similar,
          「とき」 simply denotes the time of the event, whereas 「{の間に}」 highlights the continuous period
          during which the nervousness was felt.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 入学 式 の {最中 に}、緊張 し て 足 が 震え た よ。
        english: Right in the middle of the entrance ceremony, I was so nervous my legs were shaking.
        hint: 「{最中 に}」 implies an abrupt occurrence *in the very middle* of an action, often an interruption.
          Here, the nervousness was felt throughout or when the ceremony happened, not necessarily as
          an abrupt event in the middle.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 入学 式 {ごろ}、緊張 し て 足 が 震え た よ。
        english: Around the time of the entrance ceremony, I was so nervous my legs were shaking.
        hint: 「{ごろ}」 indicates an approximate time. 「とき」 refers to the specific event itself as the temporal
          context, not just an approximate period around it.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 入学 式 の {折 に は}、緊張 し て 足 が 震え た よ。
        english: On the occasion of the entrance ceremony, I was so nervous my legs were shaking.

          is more natural for a personal, casual recollection of a past event.
    scene: A woman reminiscing about her university entrance ceremony with a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The sentence ending particle 「よ」 can be used by both male and female speakers for emphasis
      or to convey information. In this context, combined with the personal recollection of nervousness
      and physical reaction (「足が震えた」), it feels natural for a female speaker to share such a vivid personal
      experience in a casual setting. The detail about one's legs shaking due to nervousness is a very
      human and relatable detail often shared in close conversations, suitable for reflecting on past
      significant moments.

    japanese:

          - 会議 に 出席 し {たら}、資料 を 持っ て き て ください。
        english: If you attend the meeting, please bring the documents.
        hint: 「とき」 indicates the time or condition under which something happens generally or is expected
          to happen. 「{たら}」 introduces a conditional statement, implying a consequence that follows if
          the condition is met.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会議 に 出席 する {なら}、資料 を 持っ て き て ください。
        english: If you are going to attend the meeting, please bring the documents.
        hint: 「{なら}」 often implies a condition based on a known or assumed fact, or a recommendation based
          on someone's intention. 「とき」 simply states 'when' something occurs.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会議 に 出席 する {際 に}、資料 を 持っ て き て ください。
        english: On the occasion of attending the meeting, please bring the documents.

          procedures. 「とき」 is a more general and versatile term for 'when'.

    english_literally: Child's time, as for (that time), all day outside played.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 子供 の {時 に は}、一 日中 外 で 遊ん で い まし た。
        english: At the time of being a child, I used to play outside all day.
        hint: While 「{時 に は}」 is grammatically correct and similar, 「とき」 (without 「に」) is more common
          when referring to a general period like 'when I was a child', emphasizing the duration rather
          than a precise point.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 子供 の {頃 は}、一 日中 外 で 遊ん で い まし た。
        english: In my childhood, I used to play outside all day.
        hint: 「{頃} (goro)」 indicates an approximate period, often used for childhood or similar life stages.
          While similar, 「とき」 can refer to a more defined period, often linking it to a specific state
          (being a child).
      - competing_japanese:
          - 子供 だっ た {頃 に}、一 日中 外 で 遊ん で い まし た。
        english: In the period when I was a child, I used to play outside all day.
        hint: This phrase explicitly uses the past tense of 'child' and the approximate period '{頃}'.
          While grammatically fine, 「子供のとき」 is a simpler and more direct way to express 'when I was a
          child'.
    scene: A parent reminiscing with their child about their own childhood.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「〜ていました」 indicates a continuous or habitual action in the past, perfectly suited
      for describing childhood activities. 「子供のとき」 is a very common and natural way for anyone to refer
      to their childhood. The casual tone and focus on sharing a personal memory are common among parents
      speaking to their children. There is no gender-specific language in this phrasing.
  - english: When I feel stressed, I listen to classical music.
    japanese:
      - ストレス を 感じる {とき} は、クラシック 音楽 を 聴き ます。
      - ストレス を 感じる {とき} は、クラシック 音楽 を 聴く。
      - ストレス を 感じる {とき} は、クラシック 音楽 を 聴く ね。
      - ストレス を 感じる {とき} は、クラシック 音楽 を 聴く よ。
      - ストレス を 感じる {とき} は、クラシック 音楽 を 聴く わ。
    english_literally: Stress feel time, as for (that time), classical music listen.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ストレス を 感じる {と}、クラシック 音楽 を 聴き ます。
        english: When I feel stressed, I listen to classical music (as a regular outcome).
        hint: 「〜る{と}」 often implies a more direct and habitual cause-and-effect relationship or a natural
          consequence. While similar, 「とき」 is more generally 'when' a condition is met, without necessarily
          implying an automatic outcome as strongly.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ストレス を 感じ た {時 は}、クラシック 音楽 を 聴き ます。
        english: When I felt stressed, I listen to classical music.
        hint: Using the past tense 「感じた{時 は}」 would refer to a specific past instance of feeling stressed.
          Here, we are talking about a general, recurring habit that happens whenever stress is felt.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ストレス を 感じ {たら}、クラシック 音楽 を 聴き ます。
        english: If I feel stressed, I listen to classical music.
        hint: 「〜る{たら}」 sets up a conditional statement where the action follows the condition. 「とき」 indicates
          a more general 'whenever' or 'on occasions when' that specific feeling occurs.
    scene: Someone sharing their coping mechanism for stress in a casual conversation.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「〜ます」 makes the sentence polite, suitable for sharing personal habits in a semi-formal
      or friendly context. The phrase 「ストレスを感じる」 is a common and neutral way to express feeling stressed.
      While anyone might share this, a male speaker might use this direct and informative tone when explaining
      a personal routine or preference to a colleague or friend.
post_example_writeup: Observe the nuances present in each example, particularly how the chosen setting
  and speaker/listener dynamics influence the appropriate register. 「とき」 is remarkably flexible, allowing
  for specific past events, general habits, and conditional future situations depending on the preceding
  clause's tense and context.
