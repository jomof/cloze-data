    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the る-verb stem with the negative past auxiliary verb. The plain form uses 「なかった」, which is the past negative form of 「ない」. The polite form uses 「ませんでした」, which is the past negative form of 「ます」.",
    "writeup": "To create the negative past form of a る-verb (also known as a vowel-stem verb or ichidan verb), you remove the 「る」 from the dictionary form and add 「なかった」 for the plain form or 「ませんでした」 for the polite form. 「なかった」 is the past negative form of 「ない」, and 「ませんでした」 is the past negative form of 「ます」. These forms indicate that an action did not occur in the past.",
