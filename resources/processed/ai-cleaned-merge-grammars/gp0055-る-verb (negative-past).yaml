    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the る-verb stem with the negative past auxiliary verb. The plain form uses 「なかった」, which is the past negative form of 「ない」. The polite form uses 「ませんでした」, which is the past negative form of 「ます」.",
    "writeup": "To create the negative past form of a る-verb (also known as a vowel-stem verb or ichidan verb), you remove the 「る」 from the dictionary form and add 「なかった」 for the plain form or 「ませんでした」 for the polite form. 「なかった」 is the past negative form of 「ない」, and 「ませんでした」 is the past negative form of 「ます」. These forms indicate that an action did not occur in the past. Additionally, a semi-polite form exists, which is formed by adding 「です」 after the plain negative past form (e.g., 「食べなかったです」). While technically not grammatically correct according to strict traditional rules, this form is widely used and accepted in everyday conversational Japanese, and many native speakers consider it correct. This grammar point can be used across various registers, from casual conversation to formal interactions, depending on the chosen conjugation.",
