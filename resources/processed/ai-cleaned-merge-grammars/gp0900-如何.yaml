        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Primarily used in written Japanese and formal speech, often encountered in legal, academic, or official settings. It signifies a critical or precise degree of dependence.",
        "function": "Expresses that an outcome or situation is contingent upon a specific condition or factor.",
        "nuance": "Carries a rigid and formal tone, emphasizing that the result is directly influenced by the specific condition or state of the preceding noun. It implies a deeper, more critical dependency than simpler expressions.",

        "counterpoint": "Often contrasted with '次第 (shidai)' for immediacy, 'にかかっている' for direct responsibility, and 'によって' for general dependency.",

        "temporal-flow": "Implies that the decision or outcome occurs subsequent to the determination of the preceding condition"
    },
    "etymology": "「如何 (いかん)」 is originally an adverb meaning 「どのように (in what way)」. It's derived from the kanji combination 如何, which can also be read as 「いかに」, and shares its root with 「どう」, meaning 'how'. The usage shifted to express dependence, implying that the outcome varies based on the state or condition of something.",
    "writeup": "「如何 (ikan)」 is a formal expression primarily used in written Japanese and formal speech. It signifies \"depending on\" or \"depending on how.\" It's often followed by 「だ」 or 「で」 to conclude or connect clauses, respectively. While similar to 「次第 (shidai)」, 「如何」 carries a more rigid, formal tone. Pay attention to the context to determine its precise nuance, especially in legal or academic settings, where it's often encountered. The phrase 「如何によっては」 emphasizes the degree of dependence, suggesting that the outcome is heavily influenced by the preceding factor. It is also quite common to see the structure 「かどうであるによって (depending on in what way)」 used as an explanation for the meaning of 「いかん」 in various dictionaries and other teaching resources. Due to this, it may be beneficial to simply consider 「いかん」 as a less common version of 「どう」, or 「かどうである」.",

The phrase 「大きく 変わる (changes greatly)」 is a common way to express significant life changes, suitable for an inspirational context without being gender-specific or age-specific in its linguistic form itself, but its delivery and context make it so.
