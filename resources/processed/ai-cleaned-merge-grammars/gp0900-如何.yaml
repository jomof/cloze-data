    "etymology": "「如何 (いかん)」 is originally an adverb meaning 「どのように (in what way)」. It's derived from the kanji combination 如何, which can also be read as 「いかに」, and shares its root with 「どう」, meaning 'how'. The usage shifted to express dependence, implying that the outcome varies based on the state or condition of something.",
    "writeup": "「如何 (ikan)」 is a formal expression primarily used in written Japanese and formal speech. It signifies \"depending on\" or \"depending on how.\" It's often followed by 「だ」 or 「で」 to conclude or connect clauses, respectively. While similar to 「次第 (shidai)」, 「如何」 carries a more rigid, formal tone. Pay attention to the context to determine its precise nuance, especially in legal or academic settings, where it's often encountered. The phrase 「如何 に よっ て は」 emphasizes the degree of dependence, suggesting that the outcome is heavily influenced by the preceding factor. It is also quite common to see the structure 「か どう で ある に よっ て (depending on in what way)」 used as an explanation for the meaning of 「いかん」 in various dictionaries and other teaching resources. Due to this, it may be beneficial to simply consider 「いかん」 as a less common version of 「どう」, or 「か どう で ある」.",
