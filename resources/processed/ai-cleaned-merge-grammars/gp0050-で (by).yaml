    "etymology": "で is derived from the て-form of the copula だ (da), which indicates location or state. In this usage, で evolved to indicate the means or method by which something is done, essentially the 'state' or 'condition' under which the action occurs.",
    "writeup": "で is a particle that has several different uses in Japanese. This particular use of で indicates the means or method by which an action is performed. It translates to \"by\" or \"with\" in English. The noun preceding で is the instrument, method, or means used to accomplish something.\n\nで is also used when groups of people perform actions together, indicating that the group is acting with a shared objective.  The difference between と and で as 'with' is that で is used when everyone in the group has the same objective/end goal. と is used when each person is performing the action toward each other, not toward an external objective.",
