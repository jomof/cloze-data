        "usage-context": "General usage.",
        "function": "To embed a question or an uncertain element within a larger sentence, making the embedded clause function like a noun.",
        "nuance": "This usage of 「か」 highlights that the preceding phrase is an unknown or uncertain piece of information that is being inquired about or considered within the context of the main sentence. It's distinct from 「か」 used as a sentence-ending particle for direct questions.",
        "source": "Bunpro"
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「か」 has two primary functions: as a sentence-ending particle indicating a question and as an adverbial particle highlighting uncertainty. In this grammar point, 「か」 functions as an adverbial particle, similar to its use in words like 「どこか」 (somewhere) or 「誰か」 (someone). It marks the preceding question phrase as an uncertain element being inquired about within the main sentence.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「か」 serves to embed a question within a larger statement. It transforms a direct question into a clause that functions as a noun within the sentence. This is different from using 「か」 as a sentence-ending particle, which forms a direct question.\n\nWhen using 「か」 in this way, **avoid** placing 「だ」 or 「です」 immediately before it when following nouns or na-adjectives. For example, instead of 「どこだか」, use 「どこか」.\n\nThe embedded question is often followed by verbs like 「知っている」 (to know), 「分かる」 (to understand), or 「決める」 (to decide), which indicate an action or state related to the uncertain information. While the embedded question implies uncertainty, a direct question marker at the end of the main sentence is not strictly required but can be added for emphasis or clarity, especially in spoken language.",

            "nuance": "「かどうか」 is specifically used when there are only two possibilities (e.g., 'yes' or 'no', 'true' or 'false'). 「か」 with a question phrase can cover a wider range of open-ended inquiries within a sentence."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that the primary function of 「Question-phrase + か」 is to embed a question or an unknown within a larger sentence. In contrast, 「かどうか」 is used for binary choices, 「か」 (as a false friend) connects alternatives, and 「か〜ないかのうちに」 expresses a temporal relationship. Each serves a distinct purpose in Japanese grammar.",

            "etymology": "The usage of 「か」 here originates from its function as a marker of uncertainty, which is then 'known' or 'unknown' by the main verb."

            "etymology": "The use of 「か」 in embedded clauses like this traces back to its role in indicating a choice or alternative, here between 'succeed' and 'not succeed', which then becomes the subject of uncertainty."

            "nuance": "The use of 「よ」 at the end adds a sense of assertion or emphasis, common in casual speech among friends. While sometimes associated with male speech, it is also used by female speakers in a friendly, conversational context. The phrase 「誰 も 知らない よ」 (no one knows, you know) embeds the question of his whereabouts as the unknown information.",
            "etymology": "「よ」 as a sentence-final particle has evolved to convey various pragmatic meanings, from informing to asserting, often reflecting the speaker's emotional stance or desire for shared understanding."

The embedded question 「いつ 焼いて くれる か」 (when she will bake) acts as the object of anticipation for 「楽しみだ」 (I'm looking forward to it).",
            "etymology": "The particle 「な」 has roots in older forms of Japanese, often used to express strong emotion or emphasis, and it continues to be prevalent in casual, expressive speech, particularly among children and women."

            "etymology": "The imperative form 「〜て ください」 is a polite request, stemming from the verb 「くださる」 (to give), which implies the action is being 'given' to the listener as a favor or instruction."
