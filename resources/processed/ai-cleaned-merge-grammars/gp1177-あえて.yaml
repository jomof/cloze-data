    "writeup": "**あえて (aete)** is an adverb that indicates doing something despite knowing it might be difficult, dangerous, or face opposition. It expresses a deliberate choice to act in a challenging situation. Think of it as \"daring\" or \"venturing\" to do something. It often carries a nuance of defiance or determination. Note that 「あえて」 is usually written in hiragana. It is considered to be N2 level kanji, so it is commonly written without kanji.",
