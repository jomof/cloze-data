        "nuance": "Conveys a sense of conscious choice, courage, or defiance in undertaking an action that goes against expectations or personal inclination. It often implies a high degree of resolve or a willingness to face potential negative consequences.",
        "colocation": "Commonly used with verbs expressing action, opinion, or decision, such as 言う (iu, to say), する (suru, to do), 挑む (idomu, to challenge), 反対する (hantai suru, to oppose), 無視する (mushi suru, to ignore).",

    "etymology": "The etymology of 「あえて」 is linked to the classical Japanese verb 「敢える (あえる)」, which meant 'to dare', 'to venture', or 'to be able to endure'. This root signifies facing a challenge or overcoming difficulty. The adverbial form 「あえて」 maintains this core meaning of undertaking something with resolve despite obstacles or unconventionality, highlighting the speaker's conscious choice to act boldly.",
    "writeup": "**あえて (aete)** is an adverb that signifies a deliberate action taken despite the presence of difficulties, opposition, or societal expectations. It emphasizes the speaker's conscious choice and strong resolve to perform an action that might be challenging, unpopular, or against the usual course. This expression can convey various nuances, from courage and determination to a difficult, reluctant choice made out of necessity.\n\nIt is often used when the speaker goes against common sense, social pressure, or even their own initial reluctance. For example, one might \"dare to speak the truth\" even if it's uncomfortable, or \"dare not to do something\" that everyone expects. The emphasis is on the intentionality behind the action or inaction, suggesting that it required effort or conviction.\n\nWhile commonly written in hiragana, it can also be written with the kanji 「敢えて」. It is a versatile adverb found across different registers, though its deliberate nature often lends itself to more formal or reflective contexts. However, it can also appear in casual speech when expressing a strong, personal stance.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「あえて」, 「思い切って」, and 「しいて」 all relate to intentional actions, their specific nuances are distinct and crucial for precise expression. 「あえて」 signifies a deliberate and often bold choice to act despite perceived external difficulties or opposition. 「思い切って」 suggests overcoming personal hesitation or fear to make a decisive move. 「しいて」 implies acting with reluctance or under compulsion, or insisting on something against resistance. Understanding these distinctions is vital for accurate communication in Japanese.",
