    "etymology": "「なし」 comes from the classical Japanese adjective 「なし」 (無し), meaning 'not existing' or 'non-existent'. This form is the attributive form of the classical adjective 「なし」, which derived from 「なう」 (to be lacking) + 「し」 (a suffix indicating state). It is semantically related to the modern 「ない」 (nai), which is the negative form of 「ある」 (aru, to exist). Its evolution into a particle-like usage for indicating absence reflects a grammaticalization process where a word describing non-existence became a marker for 'without'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「なし」, written as 無し in kanji, functions primarily as a suffix, though it originates from a classical adjective meaning 'non-existent.' It's used to indicate the absence of something. 「なし」 is often used with the auxiliary verb 「だ」 or its conjunctive form 「で」. For example, 「なしで」 means \"without (something)\". When connecting directly to another noun, 「の」 is required, forming a phrase like 「なしの」, meaning \"(A) that is without (B)\". It can also refer to skipping or avoiding something, often paired with 「に」 to show determination, as in 「〜なしにする」 (to decide to go without ~).\n\n「なし」 tends to appear in more formal, official, literary, or fixed expressions, imparting a definitive and somewhat strong nuance of absence. It is less common in very casual, everyday conversation compared to 「ない」.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   While 「なし」 indicates absence, it's distinct from 「抜き」, which also means \"without (A)\". 「抜き」 implies the intentional removal or omission of something, derived from the verb 「抜く」 \"to remove.\" While sometimes interchangeable, 「抜き」 carries a nuance of active removal, while 「なし」 simply indicates absence or non-existence.",

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「なし」 and 「抜きで」 can translate to \"without,\" remember that 「抜きで」 and 「抜き」 have a connotation of intentional removal or omission. If you're simply stating the absence of something without implying an active removal, 「なし」 is often more appropriate. For example, a \"room with no TV\" (`テレビなしの部屋`) vs. \"coffee with sugar removed\" (`砂糖抜きコーヒー`). As for 「ない」, it is the general, everyday negative form of existence. 「なし」 conveys a more formal, definitive, or sometimes characteristic absence, often found in fixed phrases or more technical/concise descriptions.",
