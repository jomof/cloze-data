jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Used to inquire about the state, condition, manner, or method of something, or to propose
    a suggestion. While 'teineigo' is listed as the primary register for the grammar point's polite usage,
    'どう' is highly versatile and is used across all registers depending on context and accompanying particles.
  nuance: 「どう」 is a fundamental interrogative adverb in Japanese, translating broadly to 'how' or 'in
    what way'. Its precise nuance varies significantly with context. It can inquire about general states
    or conditions, seek opinions or impressions, or propose ideas. The politeness level is often determined
    by the presence or absence of particles like 「ですか」 or 「だったか」, or the broader sentence structure. In
    casual speech, it can stand alone as a direct question about someone's opinion or situation.
  colocation: Often pairs with verbs like 「する」 (to do), 「思う」 (to think), or is used with copulas like
    「です」 and 「だ」.
  grammatical-role: Interrogative adverb modifying verbs, adjectives, or entire clauses. Can also function
    as a direct inquiry in informal contexts.
  logical-flow: Initiates a question seeking information about manner, condition, or opinion, setting
    up a response that details these aspects.
  temporal-flow: Can inquire about past, present, or future states/actions, with tense being indicated
    by accompanying verbs or copulas.
  spatial-flow: Not directly related to spatial flow, but can be used in contexts involving movement or
    placement to inquire about the manner of action (e.g., how to move something).
etymology: 「どう」 originally comes from the word 「如何 (いかん)」, meaning "in what way." Over time, 「如何」 was
  shortened phonetically to 「どう」 and became a common and less formal way to ask about conditions or methods.
  This linguistic evolution reflects a natural tendency towards simplification in everyday speech.
writeup: 「どう」 is a fundamental interrogative adverb in Japanese, equivalent to "how" or "in what way"
  in English. It is incredibly versatile and can be used in a wide range of contexts to inquire about
  conditions, methods, opinions, or to make suggestions. The politeness level of 「どう」 is often determined
  by the particles and conjugations used with it. For instance, adding 「ですか」 makes it polite, while omitting
  it makes it casual. The even more polite and formal counterpart to 「どう」 is 「いかが」, which is typically
  used in more formal settings or when showing greater respect.
false_friends:
  - term: どうして
    meaning: Why? (inquiring about reason/cause)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike 「どう」, 「どうして」 inquires specifically about the reason or cause of something. It asks
      'for what reason?', whereas 「どう」 asks 'in what manner?' or 'what is the state?'.
    grammar_point: どうして (why)
  - term: どのように
    meaning: In what way? / How? (formal, specific method)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While similar in meaning, 「どのように」 is a more formal and often more precise way of asking "how"
      or "in what way" compared to 「どう」. It often implies a request for a detailed explanation of a method
      or process.
    grammar_point: どのように (in what way)
  - term: いかが
    meaning: How? / What do you think? (polite inquiry)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「いかが」 is a more polite and formal equivalent of 「どう」, often used when inquiring about opinions,
      conditions, or making suggestions, especially towards superiors or in formal situations. It conveys
      a greater sense of deference.
    grammar_point: いかが (polite how)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「どう」 is a very common and versatile word, it's essential to understand
  its distinctions from similar-sounding or related expressions. For instance, 「どうして」 specifically probes
  the *reason* behind an action or situation, demanding an explanation for *why* something happened. On
  the other hand, 「どのように」, while also meaning "how," carries a more formal tone and often seeks a detailed
  explanation of a *method* or *manner*. Think of 「どう」 as a general inquiry about state or suggestion,
  「どうして」 as an inquiry into causation, and 「どのように」 as an inquiry into process.

    japanese:
      - 新しい 仕事 は {どう}？

        english: How is the new job? (polite)
        hint: 「いかが」 is a more polite way to ask, but here we are looking for a casual inquiry among friends.
          We're looking for a casual way to ask 'how'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新しい 仕事 は どんな 感じ？
        english: How does the new job feel/seem?
        hint: 「どんな 感じ」 asks for a general impression or feeling. We're looking for a simpler, direct 'how'.
    scene: A friend asks another friend about their new job, showing interest in their experience.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: This is a very common, casual way to ask for an update or opinion on someone's current situation.
      The lack of 「ですか」 makes it suitable for close friends or family. The variation 「新しい 仕事、{どう}？」 omits
      the particle 「は」 for even greater casualness, common in close conversations. Adding 「な の？」 as in
      「新しい 仕事 は {どう} な の？」 adds a slight nuance of seeking more detailed information or a deeper insight
      into the situation.

        english: How is life in Japan for the first time? (more polite)
        hint: 「いかが」 is more polite than 「どう」, often used in formal settings. We're looking for a slightly
          less formal but still polite inquiry.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 初めて の 日本 で の 生活 は どんな 感じ です か？
        english: How does life in Japan for the first time feel/seem?
        hint: 「どんな 感じ」 asks for a general impression or feeling. We're looking for a broader inquiry about
          a state or condition.
    scene: A Japanese host asks a foreign guest about their initial experiences living in Japan.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: Using 「ですか」 makes the question polite and appropriate for conversing with someone you don't
      know intimately or for a formal setting. The inclusion of 「初めて の」 (for the first time) sets the
      context for a general inquiry about their new experience.

          the test's outcome or impression.
    scene: A student asks a classmate about a test they both took.
    register: casual
    setting: academic
    nuance: Using the past tense form 「だっ た」 makes this a casual inquiry about a past event. It expects
      a general evaluation or feeling about the test. The variation 「昨日 の テスト {どう} だっ た？」 removes the
      particle 「は」 for an even more informal tone, typical in casual conversations among classmates.

          about their thoughts.
    scene: A woman asks her close female friend for an honest opinion on her new hairstyle.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「どう だ と 思う？」 is a common way for a speaker, especially a female, to solicit an
      opinion or feedback on something personal like appearance. The question literally means 'how do
      you think it is?' and implies seeking an evaluation. The shorter form 「{どう}？」 is even more casual,
      implying the omitted 「だ と 思う」 and is very common among close friends. 「新しい ヘア スタイル 、 {どう}？」 further
      omits 「この」 as it's clear from context, making it more natural in intimate settings.
  - english: How about eating out for dinner tonight?

          but still polite proposal.

          - 今晩 の 夕食、何 か 食べ に 行き {ませ ん か}？
        english: Won't we go eat something for dinner tonight?
        hint: 「ませんか」 is a direct invitation. We're looking for a softer, more open-ended suggestion.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今晩 の 夕食、何 か 食べ に 行き {ましょう か}？
        english: Shall we go eat something for dinner tonight?
        hint: 「ましょう か」 is a direct proposal for joint action. We're looking for a gentler, more open-ended
          suggestion.
    scene: A colleague suggests going out for dinner to another colleague after work.
    register: formal
    setting: friendly
    nuance: This phrase offers a polite suggestion. The structure 「～ に どう です か？」 is a common way to propose
      an activity, subtly inviting the listener to consider the idea. It's polite but also implies a friendly
      relationship. The variant 「今晩 、 何 か 食べ に {どう} です か？」 is slightly more concise. 「今晩 の 夕食 は {どう} です
      か？」 focuses the suggestion on the dinner itself. The more explicit 「今晩 、 何 か 食べ に 行く の は {どう} です
      か？」 clarifies the action before asking for opinion.

        english: How will you approach this problem from now on? (more formal/specific)

          - これ から、この 問題 に 何 を し ます か？
        english: What will you do about this problem from now on?
        hint: This asks for a general action. We're looking for the specific method or strategy.
    scene: A team leader asks a team member about their strategy for handling a challenging task.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: In a professional setting, 「どう」 combined with a verb like 「取り組む」 (to tackle; to address) is
      used to inquire about methods or strategies. This question asks for a plan of action or a systematic
      approach to a specific issue. The shorter form 「この 問題 に {どう} 取り組み ます か？」 is still formal but omits
      「これ から」 if the 'from now on' is implied. Placing 「どう」 before the noun phrase 「この 問題 に」 as in 「これ
      から 、 {どう} この 問題 に 取り組み ます か？」 is also grammatically correct and common, shifting the emphasis slightly.

        english: Won't we go on a hot spring trip next weekend?
        hint: 「ない？」 is a direct, albeit casual, invitation using the plain negative form. We're looking
          for a softer, more open-ended suggestion.

    scene: A man suggests a weekend trip to his wife.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The simple 「{どう}？」 at the end of a suggested activity is a very casual and direct way to propose
      an idea, commonly used among close friends or family. It's a quick way to gauge interest. It's suitable
      if the context of "next weekend" is already understood, making it more natural in intimate conversations.
      This directness, coupled with a noun, is a common male way of making suggestions.
  - english: How are you feeling?

          inquiry about their current state of feeling.
    scene: A doctor asks a patient about their physical condition.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「気分 は {どう} です か？」 is a standard and polite way to inquire about someone's general health or
      mood. It's broadly applicable in various situations, from a doctor's visit to checking on a friend.
      「体調 は {どう} です か？」 specifically asks about one's physical condition, making it more precise in a
      medical context. The variant 「気分 {どう} です か？」 is slightly less formal due to the omission of the
      particle 「は」, common in spoken Japanese even in polite contexts.

      action. It shows deference to the senior colleague's experience. The use of 「～ ましょう か」 emphasizes

      manner.

    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: This informal usage of 「どう」 is common when asking for an opinion or preference between two
      or more options. It implicitly asks, "What do you think of them?" or "Which one is preferable?"
      The phrasing 「A と B、{どう}？」 is very concise and natural in casual conversation.
post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate the versatility of 「どう」 in Japanese. It can serve as a direct
  question about a state or opinion, a way to solicit feedback, or a gentle suggestion. The key is to
  pay attention to the surrounding particles and context, as these elements determine the level of formality
  and the precise nuance of the inquiry. Its adaptability makes it an essential word for conveying various
  kinds of questions in everyday Japanese.
