meaning: how; in what way; what do you think; no matter how
pronunciation:
  katakana: ドウ
  romaji: dō
formation:
  どう + Verb: Asks about the method or manner of an action.
  どう + なります/なった: Inquires about how a situation or outcome develops or turned out.
  '[Noun] は どう ですか/でしたか': Asks for an opinion or impression about a noun, or its state/condition.
  どう + Negative Verb/Adjective (e.g., どうにもならない): Emphasizes an extreme or unchangeable state, often translated
    as "no matter how/what." For example, 「どうにもならない」 (nothing can be done) indicates an unchangeable situation.
  どう (単独で/間投詞的に): Used alone or as an interjection to prompt a decision, reaction, or to express general
    inquiry.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The word 「どう」 is a contraction of the older form 「どのよう」 (dono yō) or 「いかに」 (ikani). 「どのよう」
  itself means 'what kind of way' (「どの」 - what kind of, 「よう」 - way/manner). The evolution to 「どう」 essentially
  compresses 'in what manner,' maintaining its core meaning of inquiring into method, state, or opinion.
writeup: '「どう」 is a fundamental interrogative word in Japanese, primarily used to ask "how" or "in what
  way." It seeks information about methods, states, conditions, or opinions. Its versatility makes it
  a very common word in daily conversation. **Asking about method/manner**: When inquiring "how to do
  something" or "in what way something happened," 「どう」 typically precedes the verb. For instance, 「どうしますか」(How
  will you do it? / What will you do?) asks about the intended method or course of action. **Asking about
  state/condition**: It can be used to inquire about the state of something or someone, often followed
  by a verb like 「なる」(to become) or the copula. For example, 「気分はどうですか」(How are you feeling?) directly
  asks about one''s current physical or emotional state. **Seeking opinion/impression**: When used with
  copulas like 「だ」 or 「です」 (often informally contracted to just 「どう？」), 「どう」 asks for an opinion or impression
  about something. This usage is very common, as in 「この映画はどうでしたか」(How was this movie?), where it solicits
  a subjective evaluation. **Emphasis (with negative)**: Sometimes, 「どう」 can be used to emphasize a state
  or action when paired with negative forms, such as 「どうにもならない」(There’s nothing that can be done). This
  implies that no method or effort will yield a different result.'

  - term: いかが (polite how)
    meaning: how; what; how about (polite)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「いかが」 is a more polite and formal equivalent to 「どう」, making it suitable for situations requiring
      respect or deference. While 「どう」 is general, 「いかが」 is specifically polite.
    grammar_point: いかが (polite how)
  - term: どんな (what kind of)
    meaning: what kind of; what sort of
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「どんな」 asks about the *type* or *nature* of something, focusing on classification rather than
      the method, state, or opinion. For example, 「どんな映画ですか」 asks 'What kind of movie is it?', not 'How
      was the movie?'.
    grammar_point: どんな (what kind of)
  - term: どうやって (how to do)
    meaning: how; by what means; in what way (emphasizing method)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どうやって」 specifically emphasizes the *means* or *procedure* by which an action is performed.
      While 「どう」 can imply method, 「どうやって」 explicitly asks for the 'how-to' or 'by what means.' For example,
      「どうやって 駅 へ 行きます か」 asks for detailed directions or methods.
    grammar_point: どうやって (how to do)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「どう」 covers a broad range of inquiries about methods, states, and opinions,
  it's crucial to distinguish it from related terms. 「いかが」 offers a polite alternative, essential in formal
  or respectful contexts. 「どんな」 inquires about the *nature* or *type* of something, focusing on classification
  rather than process or condition. Meanwhile, 「どうやって」 specifically probes the *means* or *procedure*
  by which an action is performed, providing a more direct query about the "how-to." Understanding these
  distinctions will allow for more precise and contextually appropriate communication.
examples:
  - english: How are you feeling?
    japanese:
      - 気分 は {どう} です か？
      - 体調 は {どう} です か？
      - 気分 は {どう}？
    english_literally: Feeling as for how is it?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{大丈夫 です か}？'
          - '{お 元気 です か}？'
        english: Are you okay? / How are you?
        hint: These phrases inquire about general well-being or if someone is alright, not explicitly
          about their specific 'feeling' or 'condition' using 'how'. We're looking for a question about
          'how' one feels.
    scene: A nurse checking on a patient's condition after surgery.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: This is a standard, polite way to ask about someone's physical or emotional state. The honorific
      prefix 「お」 is often omitted in more direct inquiries about one's state, as the focus is on the state
      itself rather than an action performed by the listener. It's a general inquiry without specific
      gender or age implications, common in healthcare settings.
  - english: How do I get to the station?
    japanese:
      - 駅 へ は {どう} 行き ます か？
      - 駅 まで は {どう} 行け ば いい です か？

        english: Where is the station?
        hint: This asks for the location of the station, not for the method or way to get there. We're
          looking for a question about 'how' to reach the station.
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{どう やっ て} 駅 へ 行き ます か？'
        english: How (by what means) do I get to the station?
        hint: While similar in meaning, this phrase emphasizes the specific means or procedure. The grammar
          point is about a more general 'how'. This uses the grammar point 「どうやって (how to do)」.
    scene: A tourist asking a passerby for directions.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: This sentence uses the polite form 「行きます」 and the particle 「へ」 to indicate direction. 「どう
      行きます か」 is a general question about the pronunciation or manner of transport or route. It's a neutral
      and polite way to ask for directions.
  - english: How was the movie?
    japanese:
      - この 映画 は {どう} でし た か？

          - この 映画 は {面白かっ た です か}？
        english: Was this movie interesting?
        hint: This asks about a specific quality (interesting), not a general opinion or impression. We're
          looking for a broad question about 'how' the movie was.
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{どんな} 映画 でし た か？'
        english: What kind of movie was it?
        hint: This asks about the type or genre of the movie, not the overall impression or evaluation.
          We're looking for an opinion on 'how' it was.
    scene: Two friends casually discussing a movie they just watched.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「どう でした か」 is a very common way to ask for an opinion or impression about something that has
      already occurred. The casual register with 「どう」 is appropriate for conversations among friends.
      It directly asks for the listener's personal feeling or review.
  - english: What do you think about that person?
    japanese:
      - あの 人 の こと {どう} 思い ます か？
      - あの 人 の こと {どう} 思う？
      - あの 方 は {どう} 思わ れ ます か？
    english_literally: That person's matter how think?

          - あの 人 は {どんな 人 です か}？
        english: What kind of person is that person?
        hint: This asks about the person's character or type, not your personal opinion or impression
          of them. We're looking for 'what' you think, not 'what kind' of person they are.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 人 の 評判 は {何 と 言わ れ て い ます か}？
        english: What is said about that person's reputation?
        hint: This inquires about public opinion or reputation, not the speaker's individual thought or
          feeling. We're looking for your personal opinion.
    scene: Two colleagues discussing a new employee at a casual lunch.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「どう 思い ます か」 is a polite but direct way to ask for someone's opinion on a person or situation.
      「こと」 (matter) is used to refer to the person or thing being discussed, making the inquiry slightly
      more indirect and thus softer than a direct 「あの 人 は どう です か？」 which might sound like an assessment
      of their well-being.
  - english: How did it turn out?
    japanese:
      - 結果 は {どう} なり まし た か？
      - 結果 は {どう} なっ た？

          - 結果 は {出 まし た か}？
        english: Did the result come out?
        hint: This asks if a result exists, not about the nature or specific outcome of that result. We're
          looking for 'how' it turned out.
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{何 が 起き まし た か}？'
        english: What happened?
        hint: This is a more general inquiry about events, not specifically about the manner or state
          of an outcome. We're looking for 'how' it turned out.
    scene: A manager asking a team member for the outcome of a complex task.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「どう なり まし た か」 specifically inquires about the process or development that led to a certain
      outcome. This form is common in professional settings when asking about the status or final state
      of a project or situation. It's less about a subjective feeling and more about objective circumstances.
  - english: What should we do about this?
    japanese:
      - これ、{どう} し ます か？
      - これ、{どう} する？
      - これ に 対し て {どう} 対処 し ます か？
    english_literally: This, how do?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ は {何 を す べき} です か？
        english: What should be done about this?
        hint: This phrasing implies a stronger sense of obligation or correct action, rather than an open
          question about a plan or decision. We're looking for a question about 'what to do' or 'how to
          proceed'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{何 を し たら いい} です か？'
        english: What should I do? (general dilemma)
        hint: This is a general question for personal advice or dilemma, not specific to a shared item

    scene: Colleagues in a meeting deciding on the next steps for a new challenge.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「どう し ます か」 is a concise and common phrase used to ask for a decision or a plan of action
      regarding a specific matter. It’s versatile for both informal and semi-formal settings, prompting
      the listener to articulate their approach or choice. This example highlights its use in a professional
      decision-making context.

          - 今夜、夕食 に {行き たい です か}？
        english: Do you want to go to dinner tonight?
        hint: This directly asks about the listener's desire, not their opinion on the proposed plan.
          We're looking for a suggestion asking 'how' they feel about it.

          - 今夜、夕食 を {食べ ましょう か}？
        english: Shall we eat dinner tonight?

          general idea. We're looking for 'how about' this idea.
    scene: Friends casually making plans for the evening.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: This is a common way to make a suggestion or proposal. By nominalizing the action (行く の は),
      the speaker is asking for the listener's opinion on the idea itself. The casual 「どう です か」 makes
      it an open, non-pushy invitation appropriate among friends.
  - english: So, how about it?
    japanese:
      - で、{どう}？
      - で、{どう} です か？

      - competing_japanese:
          - で、{意見 は}？
        english: So, what's your opinion?
        hint: This is a very blunt way to ask for an opinion, lacking the nuance of 'how about it' in
          terms of consideration. We're looking for a more open-ended 'how about it?'
    scene: A friend asking for a quick decision after presenting several options during a hangout.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「で、どう？」 is an extremely casual and direct way to prompt a decision or opinion, common among
      close friends. The particle 「で」 serves as a connective, meaning 'and so' or 'then.' It's a familiar
      expression, often used by female speakers to urge a response without being overly pushy.
  - english: How could this have happened?
    japanese:
      - 一体、{どう} なっ た の だろう？

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 一体、{何 が 起き た の だろう}？
        english: What on earth happened?
        hint: This asks about 'what' specific event occurred, not 'how' it came to be in its current state.
          We're looking for 'how' it happened.
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ は {どの よう に し て} 起き た の だろう？
        english: How did this happen (by what method)?
        hint: This phrase specifically inquires about the method or process of an occurrence, which is
          a more explicit version than the general 'how' used here. We're looking for a broader 'how could
          this have happened?'
    scene: A detective investigating a mysterious crime scene, trying to piece together the events.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: interrogative
    nuance: 「一体、どう なっ た の だろう？」 expresses strong perplexity or confusion. 「一体」 adds a sense of 'what on
      earth' or 'how in the world,' intensifying the questioning of the cause or process. The 「の だろう」
      ending conveys a sense of wondering or pondering the unknown circumstances, suitable for a reflective
      inquiry.

          - 私 の 新しい 髪型 は {似合っ て い ます か}？
        english: Does my new haircut suit me?
        hint: This asks about whether the haircut is *fitting* or *becoming*, not for a general opinion
          or impression of it. We're looking for a general opinion of 'how' it is.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の 新しい 髪型 は {どんな 感じ です か}？
        english: What kind of feeling/impression does my new haircut give?
        hint: This asks for a descriptive *kind* of impression, not a general evaluative 'how' it is.
          We're looking for 'how' you like it.
    scene: A person showing off their new haircut to a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: This is a common and versatile way to solicit opinions or impressions on something new or
      changed, whether it's an appearance, a new item, or a recent experience. The casual version 「どう？」
      is very common among close friends.
post_example_writeup: As seen in these examples, 「どう」 is incredibly versatile. It shifts meaning slightly
  depending on what it modifies and the particles it's combined with. Pay close attention to whether it's
  asking about a *method* (e.g., 「どう 行きます か」), a *state* (e.g., 「気分 は どう です か」), or an *opinion* (e.g.,
  「この 映画 は どう でし た か」). Understanding these nuances will help you use 「どう」 naturally in various contexts.
