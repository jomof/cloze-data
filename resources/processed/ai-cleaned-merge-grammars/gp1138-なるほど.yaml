        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "Can be used as a standalone interjection to express understanding, or within a sentence to affirm a fact or observation. It conveys a sense of comprehension and conviction, often marking the moment a previously unclear fact becomes clear or an ambiguous situation gains clarity. While frequently used in casual settings, its meaning of affirmation allows for use in more formal contexts when acknowledging information.",
        "function": "Indicates that the speaker/writer affirms the correctness of something they have heard, read, or observed.",
        "nuance": "Carries a nuance of 'now I understand' or 'that makes sense,' often following new information or an explanation. It implies an internal processing of information, leading to insight or confirmation of a prior expectation. It differs from a simple 'yes' in that it conveys a deeper level of comprehension and acceptance.",
        "source": "Derived from DOJG and other Japanese grammar resources.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a sentence adverb, modifying the entire clause or serving as a discourse marker."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「なるほど」 originates from the verb 「なる (naru)」, meaning \"to become,\" and 「ほど (hodo)」, meaning \"degree\" or \"extent.\" The combination implies \"to the extent that it becomes clear\" or \"to the extent that it makes sense.\" It signifies a realization or affirmation, conveying that something has reached the 'degree' of 'becoming' understandable or true.",
    "writeup": "「なるほど」 is an adverb that serves to express understanding, agreement, or affirmation. It conveys that the speaker or writer acknowledges the correctness or validity of something they have heard, read, or observed. It functions similarly to expressions such as \"I see,\" \"Indeed,\" or \"That makes sense\" in English, often signaling a moment of comprehension and conviction in response to an explanation or new information. While it can be used as a standalone interjection to show immediate understanding, it is also frequently integrated into a sentence to affirm a specific fact or conclusion.\n\nThis expression is particularly effective when conveying a sense of realization—the moment a previously unknown fact becomes clear, or an ambiguous situation gains clarity. It implies that the speaker has processed the information and found it logical or consistent with their understanding. For example, if someone explains a complex concept, replying with 「なるほど」 shows that the explanation has resonated and provided clarity.\n\nWhile commonly used in casual conversation, 「なるほど」 is versatile enough to appear in more formal contexts when acknowledging information or confirming a point. Its usage is not restricted by gender or age, making it a broadly applicable expression in various social situations.",

                    "mitigation": "The nuance of realizing something was simpler than expected, often after a clear explanation, is best conveyed by 「なるほど」. Using 「本当 に」 (really) would emphasize truth but not the 'aha!' moment that 「なるほど」 implies when a prior misconception is corrected."

The scene highlights this moment of clarity regarding the cause of the delay."
