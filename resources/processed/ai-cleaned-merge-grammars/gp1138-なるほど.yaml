        "Part of Speech": "Adverb",
        "Function": "Indicates that the speaker/writer affirms the correctness of something heard, read, or observed.",
        "Usage": "Can be used as a standalone interjection to express understanding, or within a sentence to affirm a fact or observation.",
        "Register": "Commonly used in both casual and formal conversation to show comprehension or agreement."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「なるほど」 originates from the verb 「なる (naru)」, meaning \"to become,\" and 「ほど (hodo)」, meaning \"degree\" or \"extent.\" The combination implies \"to the extent that it becomes clear\" or \"to the extent that it makes sense.\"",
    "writeup": "「なるほど」 is an adverb used to express understanding, agreement, or affirmation. It signifies that the speaker or writer acknowledges the correctness or validity of something they have heard, read, or observed. It functions similarly to expressions such as \"I see,\" \"Indeed,\" or \"That makes sense\" in English, conveying a sense of comprehension and conviction in response to an explanation or new information. This expression can be used as a standalone interjection to show immediate understanding, or integrated within a sentence to affirm a specific fact or conclusion. It is particularly effective when conveying a sense of realization—the moment a previously unknown fact becomes clear, or an ambiguous situation gains clarity.",
