    "etymology": "「各」 is derived from the pictographic representation of a foot approaching a place, signifying arrival at 'each' individual location or point.",
    "writeup": "The prefix 「各 (かく)」 is used to indicate \"each,\" \"every,\" or \"respective.\" It is generally used before nouns, especially words of Chinese origin (kanji compounds) or katakana words. While it's not typically used with units of time, 「各」 is commonly used to identify items in a sequence, such as floors in a building or houses on a street. It has a slightly more formal and precise tone compared to synonyms like 「それぞれ」. When 「各」 is combined with nouns that denote a person (e.g., 「各人」, 「各自」), it refers to \"each person\" or \"individually.\" This usage is common in instructions or formal statements where individual responsibility or action is emphasized. While 「各」 serves a similar function to 「各々 (おのおの)」, 「各々」 is predominantly used when referring to people, often with a slightly more personal nuance, whereas 「各」 is broader in application and can refer to inanimate objects or abstract concepts as well. 「各」 is frequently encountered in official documents, announcements, and business communications.",

            "nuance": "「各々 (おのおの)」 is generally used when referring to people or distinct entities, emphasizing individual action or responsibility. It often carries a slightly more personal or traditional nuance than 「各」, and can be used as a standalone noun or adverb. For example, 「皆、各々考えがある。」 (Everyone has their own thoughts, respectively)."

            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "「それぞれ」 is a very common and versatile word that can mean 'each', 'respectively', or 'individually'. It is less formal than 「各」 and can be used with a wider range of nouns, including abstract ones, and often emphasizes individual differences or separate actions. For example, 「それぞれの意見を聞く。」 (Listen to each opinion)."

            "term": "個別",
            "meaning": "Individual, separate",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「個別 (こべつ)」 is a noun meaning 'individual' or 'separate'. While it implies distinctness, it focuses on the state of being separate rather than the distribution or enumeration of each item within a group, as 「各」 does. For example, 「個別に質問する。」 (Ask a question individually)."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When distinguishing 「各」 from 「各々」, remember that 「各」 is more often a prefix indicating \"each\" within a defined group, especially with formal or Chinese-derived nouns. 「各々」, on the other hand, is a more standalone word, often referring to \"each one\" of people, emphasizing individual actions. For 「それぞれ」, consider its flexibility and less formal tone; it's a general term for 'each' that doesn't carry the same formal or systematic nuance as 「各」. Finally, 「個別」 describes things as being 'separate' or 'individual', focusing on their distinct state rather than their count within a set. Choosing the right term depends on the formality, the type of noun, and the specific emphasis desired.",

This highlights its function in systematically referring to every member of a set. When used with words like 「各人 (かくじん - each person)」 or 「各自 (かくじ - each one/person)」, the emphasis shifts to individual responsibility or action within a group, particularly in formal instructions or statements of accountability. Understanding these collocations is key to mastering the precise application of 「各」.",
