        "[Verb in て-form] + いては": "Expresses a negative outcome if an action continues."

    "details": {
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "General use",
        "function": "To express that a continuous action or state will inevitably lead to a negative outcome.",
        "nuance": "Implies a warning or a prediction of an undesirable consequence stemming from an ongoing situation or habit."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ていては」 is derived from 「ている」 (the continuous form of a verb) + 「は」 (a topic marker indicating a hypothetical or repetitive situation). Thus, it combines the idea of continuous action with a conditional \"if\" or \"when\". It signifies that an ongoing action or state, if continued, will lead to a certain outcome, almost always a negative one.",
    "writeup": "「ていては」 is used to express that if one continues with a certain action (A), a negative outcome (B) will result. It combines the 「て」-form of a verb, 「いる」 (to be) in its 「て」-form (「いて」), and 「は」. The 「ては」 part is similar to that in other patterns like 「てはいけない」, 「てはならない」, and 「てはだめ」, which express prohibition or negativity. Essentially, 「ていては」 highlights the continuous nature of an action and warns about its potential consequences. It is a blend of continuous action and hypothetical/repetitive situations, depending on the verb it attaches to, consistently pointing towards an undesirable outcome.",

            "term": "ては",
            "meaning": "If; when; since; because",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「ては」 has a broader range of meanings related to conditions and circumstances, covering general hypothetical situations or reasons. In contrast, 「ていては」 specifically focuses on the negative consequences of a *continuous* action or ongoing state. The key difference lies in the emphasis on the ongoing nature of the condition leading to the negative result in 「ていては」."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「ては」 and 「ていては」 express conditional or consequential relationships, it is important to distinguish their nuances. 「ていては」 specifically emphasizes the ongoing nature of the condition and its negative result. Use 「ては」 for general conditions or reasons, and 「ていては」 when you want to highlight that a continuous action or state is leading to an undesirable outcome.",
