    "etymology": "The adverbial particle 「ばかり」 (bakari) originally meant 'only' or 'just'. When combined with a verb and the copula 「だ」, it expresses the idea that something is continuously moving in one direction, typically emphasizing a trend or gradual change. The 「だ」 functions as a declarative copula.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ばかりだ」 (bakari da) is used to express that something continues to move in one direction, or that one action is only happening, often suggesting a negative or undesirable trend. It's similar to saying \"only continues to\" or \"keeps on -ing\" in English.\n\n*   It typically attaches to the **dictionary form** of a verb. It can also be used in the polite form 「ばかりです」.\n*   This grammar is most commonly used with verbs that describe some form of change, such as increasing or decreasing, getting better or worse, becoming faster or slower, etc.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   While often associated with negative trends, 「ばかりだ」 can also describe positive trends, though this is less common.\n*   If the speaker wishes to extend the sentence with additional information after 「ばかりだ」, the copula 「だ」 will change to its conjunctive `て-form` 「で」, becoming 「ばかりで」.",
