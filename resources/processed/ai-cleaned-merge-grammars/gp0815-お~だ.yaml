        "usage-context": "Used to show respect to the listener or a third person, especially superiors, customers, or those deserving of high regard. Commonly employed in business settings, service industries, or when speaking to someone of higher social standing.",
        "function": "To respectfully describe the state, action, or possession of the listener or a third party, without directly using honorific verbs like '～なさる' or '～いらっしゃる'.",
        "nuance": "This construction elevates the social standing of the person whose action or state is being described, creating a sense of deference and politeness on the part of the speaker. It is a more formal and respectful alternative to simple plain forms or polite forms like '～です'.",

        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a polite copula or a respectful description of a state or action."
    },
    "etymology": "The construction 'お~だ' combines the honorific prefixes 'お' or 'ご' with a verb stem or noun, followed by the copula 'だ'. 'お' and 'ご' are prefixes used to add politeness and respect to words. 'お' is traditionally used with native Japanese words (和語, wago) and verb stems, while 'ご' is used with words of Chinese origin (漢語, kango), particularly verbal nouns. The copula 'だ' is a plain form of 'です', used to assert or describe a state. The combination expresses a sense of deference, making statements more respectful, functioning as a polite alternative to the direct plain form 'だ' or even the polite 'です' in certain contexts, particularly when referring to an action or state of someone superior.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「お～だ」 is a highly versatile and respectful expression used to describe the state or actions of another person, particularly a listener or a third party of higher status. It functions as a polite copula, conveying a sense of deference and formality. While similar in function to the basic polite copula 「です」, 「お～だ」 adds an extra layer of respect, making it suitable for professional, customer service, or other formal interactions.\n\nThis construction is typically formed by combining either the honorific prefix 「お」 or 「ご」 with a verb stem or a verbal noun, followed by the copula 「だ」. The choice between 「お」 and 「ご」 is determined by the word it precedes:\n\n*   **「お」** is generally used with native Japanese verbs (和語) in their masu-stem form. For example, from the verb 急ぐ (いそぐ - to hurry), you get お急ぎだ (お いそぎ だ - 'you are in a hurry').\n*   **「ご」** is typically used with Sino-Japanese verbal nouns (漢語). For example, from the noun 研究 (けんきゅう - research), you get ご研究だ (ご けんきゅう だ - 'someone is researching').\n\nIt is important to remember that 「お～だ」, while using the plain form copula 「だ」, inherently carries a polite and honorific nuance due to the prefixes. When used in spoken Japanese, it is often followed by other polite sentence-ending particles or expressions such as 「ですか」, 「でしょうか」, or 「でございます」 to further enhance the politeness, especially in formal speech. Its primary function is to show respect towards the person whose action or state is being described, rather than the speaker's own action or state.\n\nIt is not commonly used when referring to oneself or one's own actions, as honorifics are directed outwards to show respect to others. While it appears with 「だ」, which is typically plain form, the honorific prefix transforms the entire expression into a respectful one. This nuance distinguishes it from merely using the plain form for a statement.",

Choosing the correct form depends on whether you are describing a state, an action, or simply making a polite statement about someone or something.",

    "post_example_writeup": "When using this grammar point, it is crucial to select the appropriate prefix, 「お」 or 「ご」, based on the etymological origin of the word it modifies. 「お」 is generally for native Japanese words and verb stems, while 「ご」 is for Sino-Japanese words, particularly verbal nouns. Incorrect usage can sound unnatural or even rude. While the copula 「だ」 is typically plain, its combination with honorific prefixes transforms the entire expression into a highly polite and respectful one, distinguishing it from simple casual speech.",
