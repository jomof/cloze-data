    "etymology": "The construction 'お~だ' combines the honorific prefixes 'お' or 'ご' with a verb stem or noun, followed by the copula 'だ'. 'お' and 'ご' are prefixes used to add politeness and respect to words. The copula 'だ' is a plain form of 'です', used to assert or describe a state. The combination expresses a sense of deference, making statements more respectful.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 'お~だ' is used to express politeness and respect, especially when speaking about actions, states, or items related to the listener or a third person. Think of it as a more polite and respectful version of 'です', often employed in business or formal settings. \n\nIt's formed by attaching the honorific prefixes 'お' or 'ご' to a verb stem or Sino-Japanese noun, respectively, followed by the copula 'だ'.  \n\nFor example:\n*   お + verb stem + だ: お急ぎだ (o-isogi da) - \"You are in a hurry\"\n*   ご + Sino-Japanese noun + だ: ご多忙だ (go-tabō da) - \"You are very busy\"\n\nRemember to use 'お' with native Japanese verbs and 'ご' with Sino-Japanese nouns (verbal nouns) to ensure correct usage. This form is often used in situations where you want to show deference, such as addressing customers or superiors.",
