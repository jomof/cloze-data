    "etymology": "The prefix 「お」 or 「ご」 is added to verbs or nouns to make them more polite. 「だ」 is the plain form of 「です」, but in this structure, it doesn't lose the politeness.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「お～だ」 is a polite way of speaking about someone's actions or state. It's similar to 「です」 but carries a more respectful tone, especially when referring to the listener or a respected third party. The 「お」 prefix attaches to the stem of verbs (Vます) and the 「ご」 prefix attaches to verbal nouns (VN). This grammar is versatile and used in various formal settings. Remember that the level of politeness is elevated, so use it appropriately. For instance, you might say 「お忙しいだ」 to someone you respect, indicating that they are busy.",
