    "etymology": "The verb 「くれる」 originally meant \"to give.\" Over time, it evolved to also express the nuance of someone doing something as a favor or kindness, directed towards the speaker or someone close to them. The kanji 「呉」 imparts a sense of bestowing or granting, reflecting the favor aspect. The kanji 「呉」 is not typically used in modern writing, especially since this word is learned early. It is good to know for reading older texts.",
    "writeup": "「呉れる・くれる」 is used to express that someone does something for **me** or someone close to **me** (like my family or close friends). It conveys a sense of receiving a favor or kindness. It's important to understand that 「くれる」 is always used from the **receiver's perspective**. The person doing the action is providing a benefit to the speaker or someone in their 'inner circle'.\n\nThe kanji form 「呉れる」 is more formal. Today, it is more common to see it written in hiragana as 「くれる」, especially in everyday conversation. Using 「呉れる」 can add a touch of politeness or formality.\n\nIn terms of politeness, 「くれます」is the polite form. So, 「くれる」 is the dictionary form, 「くれます」 is the polite form, 「くれない」 is the negative form, and 「くれました」 is the past form. \n\nThis differs from 「あげる」, which means to give or do something for someone *else*.",
