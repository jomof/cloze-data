    "writeup": "「ところだ」 in this context indicates the location of a place by describing how long it takes to reach it from a specific point, using a particular mode of transport. It's similar to saying \"is X minutes away by Y.\" The structure typically involves specifying the starting point (e.g., station), the means of transport (e.g., bus, car, walking), and the time required to reach the destination. For example, 「私のうちは駅から歩いて十分のところだ」 means \"My house is a 10-minute walk from the station.\"",
