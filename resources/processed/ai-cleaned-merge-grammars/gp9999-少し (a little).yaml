etymology: The word 少し (すこし) historically derives from 少なし (すくなし), an older form of the adjective 少ない
  (すくない), meaning "few" or "little." The し ending shifted its function over time to become an adverbial
  suffix, similar to how other adjectives ending in し could form adverbs. This etymological connection
  highlights its core meaning of "a small quantity" or "a slight degree."
writeup: |-
  少し (すこし) is a versatile Japanese word primarily used as an adverb to indicate a small amount, degree, or duration. It can modify verbs, adjectives, and occasionally nouns (usually with the particle の).

  One of the key distinctions of 少し lies in its nuance compared to similar expressions like ちょっと. While both can be translated as "a little," 少し generally carries a more formal, objective, or polite tone. It suggests a measurable, albeit small, quantity or a slight, noticeable difference. For instance, when asking for a small quantity of something, 少し is often preferred for politeness.

  少し can also be used to mitigate the strength of a statement, making it sound softer or less direct. For example, saying 少し難しい (sukoshi muzukashii) "a little difficult" is a common way to express that something is not overwhelmingly difficult but still presents some challenge. When used with nouns, 少し often takes the particle の (e.g., 少しの時間 - sukoshi no jikan - "a little time"). This usage turns 少し into an adjectival phrase, describing the noun that follows. Understanding 少し is fundamental as it appears frequently in daily conversations and written Japanese, covering a wide range of situations from polite requests to subtle descriptions.
false_friends:
  - term: ちょっと
    meaning: a little, a bit, a moment, a short while
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ちょっと is more casual and versatile. Besides indicating a small quantity, it can also mean "a
      moment" (e.g., ちょっと待って - "wait a moment") or express a slight inconvenience or hesitation. ちょっと
      can also be used to soften a refusal or a request, e.g., ちょっと無理です ("that's a bit difficult/impossible").
      少し is more objective and focuses solely on quantity or degree.
    grammar_point: ちょっと (adverb)
  - term: 少ない
    meaning: few, little (adjective)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 少ない is an い-adjective meaning "few" or "scarce," describing a state of having a small number
      or amount. 少し is an adverb modifying the degree of something or an action. For example, お金が少ない (okane
      ga sukunai) means "there is little money," while 少しお金がある (sukoshi okane ga aru) means "I have a
      little money." 少ない is predicative or attributive; 少し modifies verbs or adjectives.
    grammar_point: 少ない (few・little)
  - term: 少しも〜ない
    meaning: not even a little, not at all
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 少しも〜ない is a fixed negative expression meaning "not at all" or "not even a little." It is used
      with negative verbs or adjectives to emphasize a complete lack of something. 少し alone, in a positive
      context, means "a little." For example, 少しも分からない (sukoshi mo wakaranai) means "I don't understand
      at all," while 少し分かる (sukoshi wakaru) means "I understand a little."
    grammar_point: すこしも〜ない (not even a little)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 少し and ちょっと both convey the idea of "a little," 少し leans towards a more
  formal or objective tone, focusing purely on quantity or degree. ちょっと, on the other hand, is more casual
  and has broader uses, including indicating a short duration or softening a statement. 少ない is an adjective
  describing scarcity, not an adverb modifying actions or qualities like 少し. Finally, 少しも〜ない is a specific
  phrase used for emphatic negation, meaning "not at all," which contrasts with the positive meaning of
  少し by itself. Keep these distinctions in mind to use them accurately.
