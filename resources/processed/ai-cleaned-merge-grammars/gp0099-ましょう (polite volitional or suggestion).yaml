pronunciation:
  katakana: マショウ
  romaji: mashou
formation:
  Verb [ます-stem] + ましょう: Used to make suggestions or express intention in a polite manner.
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  function: Expresses polite suggestion, invitation, or speaker's volition/intention
etymology: ましょう is derived from the auxiliary verb ます (masu), indicating politeness. It is the volitional
  form of ます, expressing intent or invitation in a polite way. Historically, it evolved from earlier forms
  that also conveyed intent or recommendation.
writeup: ましょう is a versatile auxiliary verb used to express polite suggestions, invitations, or the speaker's
  own volition or intention. It attaches to the ます-stem of a verb. For instance, 食べます (tabemasu, to eat)
  becomes 食べましょう (tabemashou, let's eat or I will eat). It is commonly translated as "let's" when making
  a suggestion to others, as in "Let's go together." However, it can also convey the speaker's firm resolution
  or intention, similar to "I shall" or "We will" in English. In this latter usage, the speaker is expressing
  a deliberate and purposeful action, often to themselves or as a declaration to others, without necessarily
  inviting participation. The politeness of ましょう makes it suitable for a wide range of social contexts,
  from casual suggestions among friends to more formal declarations in a business setting.

  - term: Verb[う・よう]
    meaning: Let's, I shall (Casual volitional)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike ましょう, Verb[う・よう] is a more casual way to express volition and is typically used among
      close friends or family.
    grammar_point: Volitional Form (casual suggestion or intention)
  - term: ませんか
    meaning: Won't you, Would you not, Why don't we
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike ましょう, ませんか invites the listener to participate in an activity but also seeks their
      agreement or preference.
    grammar_point: ませんか (invitation or suggestion)
  - term: 〜ましょうか
    meaning: Shall we, Shall I
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike ましょう, 〜ましょうか is used to offer help or make a suggestion while seeking the listener's
      confirmation or desire. While it includes ましょう, the addition of か shifts its function to an inquiry
      or offer.
    grammar_point: Verb[ましょう]+か (polite offer or suggestion)
  - term: つもりだ
    meaning: Intend to, plan to (speaker's firm intention/plan)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While ましょう expresses a polite intention or a suggestion, つもりだ expresses a firm, decided plan
      or intention of the speaker and is not used for suggestions to others.
    grammar_point: つもりだ (intention or conviction)
  - term: ことにする
    meaning: Decide to do (a personal decision)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ことにする signifies a personal decision that has been made, often after consideration, and implies
      that the speaker will act according to that decision. ましょう expresses a polite intention or suggestion,
      which might not be a firm, deliberated decision in the same way.
    grammar_point: ことにする (to decide to)
post_false_friends_writeup: ましょう is suitable for suggesting an activity to someone when you are pretty
  sure they will agree, or when expressing your own polite intention. ませんか can be used when you want to
  make an invitation and are somewhat less sure of their agreement, or simply want to offer a choice.
  〜ましょうか is most suitable when you are offering to do something for someone or asking for a decision from
  the listener. While つもりだ expresses a firm personal intention and ことにする indicates a personal decision,
  ましょう can convey a polite intention or a suggestion for a shared action. These are distinct from the
  more resolute or decided nature of つもりだ and ことにする.
