  katakana: ダレカ・ドコカ・ダレモ・ドコモ
  romaji: dareka・dokoka・daremo・dokomo
formation:
  Question Word (誰・どこ) + か: Forms an indefinite positive statement, meaning 'someone' or 'somewhere,'
    typically used in questions or contexts of uncertainty.
  Question Word (誰・どこ) + も + Negative Verb: Forms an indefinite negative statement, meaning 'no one' or
    'nowhere.'
  Question Word (誰・どこ) + も + Affirmative Verb (less common): Forms an indefinite universal affirmative
    statement, meaning 'everyone' or 'everywhere,' often implying 'without exception.' This usage can
    sometimes be formal or literary, and '誰もが' or '誰でも' are more common for 'everyone.'
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  function: Expresses indefiniteness regarding people or places, or indicates a complete absence or universal
    inclusion.
  nuance: The particle か adds a sense of uncertainty or asking. The particle も, when combined with a negative
    verb, signifies a complete lack or exclusion. When combined with an affirmative verb, it implies inclusiveness
    or universality.
  grammatical-role: Indefinite noun phrase, often functioning as subject or object.
  spatial-flow: In the case of どこか or どこも, these expressions relate to movement to or location within
    unspecified places.
etymology: The origins of these expressions lie in combining interrogative pronouns (誰 'who' and どこ 'where')
  with the particles か and も. The particle か, historically an interrogative marker, evolved to also denote
  indefiniteness ('some'). The particle も, which implies inclusion or addition ('also', 'even'), when
  paired with interrogatives and negative verbs, creates the sense of 'not even one' (no one/nothing/nowhere).
  Its use with affirmative verbs to mean 'everyone/everywhere' extends its inclusive nature to all possibilities.
writeup: |-
  The indefinite pronouns 誰か・どこか・誰も・どこも are fundamental to expressing uncertainty, absence, or universality in Japanese. They are formed by combining question words (誰 'who' and どこ 'where') with the particles か and も. Understanding the role of these particles is key to mastering these expressions.

  When you use **〜か**, as in 誰か or どこか, you are expressing an indefinite positive. 誰か means "someone" or "anyone," and どこか means "somewhere" or "anywhere." These are often used in questions, or when the speaker doesn't know the specific person or place. For instance, if you hear a sound, you might ask, "誰かいますか？" ("Is someone there?") or you might say, "どこか行きたいです。" ("I want to go somewhere.")

  Conversely, when you use **〜も** with a negative verb, as in 誰も〜ない or どこも〜ない, you are expressing a complete absence or negation. 誰も〜ない means "no one" or "nobody," and どこも〜ない means "nowhere" or "not anywhere." For example, "部屋には誰もいませんでした。" ("There was no one in the room.") or "週末はどこも行きませんでした。" ("I didn't go anywhere on the weekend.") This construction emphasizes the total lack of people or places.

  While less common in everyday conversation than 皆 (みんな) or どこでも, 誰も and どこも can also be used with affirmative verbs to mean "everyone" or "everywhere," emphasizing a sense of 'without exception' or 'all-inclusively.' This usage often carries a slightly more formal or emphatic tone. For instance, one might encounter phrases like 「誰もが知っている」("everyone knows") or 「どこもかしこも」("everywhere"). However, for simply stating "everyone" or "everywhere," more direct terms like 皆 or どこでも are typically preferred.

  These patterns lay the groundwork for similar indefinite expressions involving other interrogative words, such as 何 (なに, 'what') and いつ (いつ, 'when').

  - term: なにか・なにも
    meaning: something・nothing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: These expressions function identically to 誰か・どこか・誰も・どこも, but they refer to 'things' or 'matters'
      rather than people or places.
    grammar_point: なにか・なにも (something or nothing)
post_false_friends_writeup: While the grammatical structure is the same, remembering that 誰・どこ refer to
  people and places, while 何 refers to things, will help you avoid mixing them up. The nuance of uncertainty
  (〜か) versus complete absence/inclusion (〜も) remains consistent across both sets of expressions.
examples:
  - english: Is there someone in this room?
    japanese:
      - この 部屋 に {誰 か} い ます か？
      - この 部屋 に {誰 か} いる？
    english_literally: In this room, someone exists?

      - competing_japanese:
          - この 部屋 に {誰} い ます か？
        english: Who is in this room?
        hint: Using just 誰 asks for a specific person. We're asking if any person is present, not who.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 部屋 に {皆} い ます か？
        english: Is everyone in this room?
        hint: 皆 asks if all people are present. We're asking if any person is present.

    japanese:
      - この 荷物 を {誰 か} 手伝っ て くれ ませ ん か？

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 荷物 を {誰 が} 手伝っ て くれ ませ ん か？
        english: Who will help me with this luggage?
        hint: Adding が makes it a specific 'who.' We are looking for 'someone' unspecified to help.
    scene: You are struggling with heavy luggage at the station.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: apologetic
    nuance: The use of 「誰か」 combined with the polite request 「手伝ってくれませんか」 indicates a general plea for
      assistance, not directed at a specific individual. It softens the request by implying 'is there
      anyone willing to help?'
  - english: I want to go somewhere quiet during the summer vacation.
    japanese:
      - 夏休み に {どこ か} 静か な 場所 に 行き たい です。

        english: I want to go to a quiet place during the summer vacation.
        hint: This sentence is grammatically correct but lacks the nuance of 'somewhere' unspecified.
          We're looking for 'somewhere quiet,' emphasizing the indefiniteness.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 夏休み に {どこ} に 行き たい です か？
        english: Where do you want to go during summer vacation?
        hint: Using just どこ turns it into a direct question 'where?'. We're expressing a desire to go
          'somewhere' in general.

        english: Yesterday, there were no people in the office.
        hint: This is grammatically correct but 誰も emphasizes that 'not a single person' was there, which
          is a stronger negation than just 'no people'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昨日、オフィス に は {皆} い ませ ん でし た。
        english: Yesterday, everyone was not in the office.

post_example_writeup: Pay close attention to the particles か and も. They are the core components that
  transform question words into indefinite expressions. While か introduces uncertainty, も, especially
  with negatives, creates an absolute statement. Practice recognizing these patterns in various contexts
  to solidify your understanding.
