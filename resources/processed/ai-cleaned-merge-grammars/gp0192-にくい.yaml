    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にくい」 shares its origin with the kanji 「難」 (nan), which appears in 「難しい」 (muzukashii, difficult). Thus, 「にくい」 inherently carries the nuance of something being 'difficult' in the sense of requiring skill or effort.",
    "writeup": "The い-adjective 「にくい」 is attached to the ます-stem of verbs to express that something is \"difficult to do.\" The nuance is that the difficulty arises from the required skill level or similar factors. This is different from 「づらい」, which indicates difficulty due to something being unbearable or hard to endure. Remember that 「にくい」 is related to 「難しい」 (difficult), while 「づらい」 focuses on the unpleasantness of the action.",
