    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にくい」 is derived from the い-adjective 「難(むずか)しい」 (muzukashii), meaning \"difficult.\" It shares the kanji 難, reinforcing the idea of difficulty.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「にくい」 means \"difficult to\" or \"hard to\" do something. It is attached to the ます-stem of a verb, similar to 「やすい」 (easy to do). The nuance of 「にくい」 suggests the difficulty arises from required skill, inherent properties of the object, or other factors making the action inherently challenging. In contrast, 「づらい」 implies difficulty stemming from an unpleasant or unbearable feeling.",
