    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にくい」 originates from the classical Japanese `ku`-form ending of adjectives expressing difficulty. Its root is directly connected to the adjective `難い (かたい)` (or `かたし` in classical form), meaning \"difficult\" or \"hard,\" which shares the same kanji 難. Over time, this `ku`-form combined with the `masu` stem of verbs, developing into the modern `~にくい` construction. The shared kanji 難 with `難しい (むずかしい)` (difficult) reinforces its core meaning of inherent or practical difficulty, rather than a subjective or emotional one.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「にくい」 is attached to the ます-stem of a verb to indicate that an action is **difficult to perform**. This difficulty typically stems from an inherent quality of the object, a lack of necessary skill, or an objective circumstance that makes the action challenging. It functions grammatically like an い-adjective.\n\nFor example:\n*   このペンは**書きにくい**。 (This pen is **hard to write with**.) - *The pen itself has a characteristic that makes writing difficult.*\n*   あの人は**話しかけにくい**。 (That person is **hard to talk to**.) - *The person's demeanor or circumstances make approaching them difficult.*\n\n**Key Nuance and Distinction from Similar Expressions:**\n\nWhile 「にくい」 translates to \"hard to do,\" its nuance is crucial for correct usage. It emphasizes **objective or inherent difficulty**. This contrasts with other expressions:\n\n*   **〜づらい (zurai)**: This expression also means \"hard to do,\" but it carries the nuance of **subjective difficulty** or **discomfort**. The difficulty arises from the speaker's personal feelings, physical discomfort, or a psychological burden that makes the action unpleasant or unbearable. For instance, if you are ill, you might say 「喉が痛くて、食べづらい。」 (My throat hurts, so it's **hard/uncomfortable to eat**.) Here, the difficulty is personal and stems from pain.\n\n*   **〜がたい (gatai)**: This expression implies a strong emotional or moral impossibility. It means something is \"hard to do\" because it goes against one's feelings, principles, or expectations, often suggesting an unlikelihood or incredulity. For example, 「信じがたい話」 (an **unbelievable** story) means it's hard to believe due to the shocking nature of the content.\n\nIn summary, 「にくい」 focuses on the **practical aspects of difficulty**, whether due to design, skill, or environment. 「づらい」 points to **personal discomfort**, and 「がたい」 suggests an **emotional or moral barrier** making an action difficult or impossible.",

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When choosing between 「にくい」, 「づらい」, and 「がたい」, consider the nature of the difficulty. Use 「にくい」 when the difficulty arises from an objective characteristic or external factor, such as a poorly designed object or a task requiring specific skills. Use 「づらい」 when the difficulty is personal, caused by discomfort, pain, or an emotional burden. Use 「がたい」 when the action is difficult due to a strong emotional or moral barrier, making it nearly impossible or unbelievable. For example, if a chair is uncomfortable to sit in, it is 「座りづらい」; if the chair is broken and hard to sit on, it is 「座りにくい」; if it is hard to accept someone's unkind words, it is 「受け入れがたい」.",
