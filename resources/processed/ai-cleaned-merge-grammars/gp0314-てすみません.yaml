    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てすみません」 comes from the combination of the te-form 「て」, which indicates a reason or cause, and 「すみません」, meaning \"I'm sorry\". 「すみません」 itself comes from the verb 「済む」 (sumu), meaning \"to finish\" or \"to settle\". So, literally, 「てすみません」 implies that something is not yet settled or resolved due to the preceding action, and the speaker is expressing regret for that situation.",
    "writeup": "「てすみません」 is a grammar construction used to express regret about something. It can be translated as \"I'm sorry for [doing something]\". The 「て」-form indicates the reason or cause for the apology, while 「すみません」 expresses the apology itself. Think of it as acknowledging an action that has led to an unresolved issue. While it translates to \"I'm sorry,\" understanding it as highlighting regret or lingering feelings about something may make it easier to grasp.",
