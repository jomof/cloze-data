    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てすみません」combines the 「て」-form of a verb with 「すみません」. 「すみません」 comes from the verb 「済む(すむ)」(to finish, to be completed). The 「て」-form indicates a reason or cause. Therefore, 「てすみません」literally translates to \"(A) happened, and it is not済む\", implying that the speaker feels something is unresolved or incomplete due to the action described by the 「て」-form verb.",
    "writeup": "「てすみません」expresses the speaker's apology or regret for something that has occurred. It's often translated as \"I'm sorry for (A).\" The 「て」-form indicates the reason or cause for the apology. 「すみません」itself comes from the verb 「済む(すむ)」 meaning \"to finish.\" Thus, 「てすみません」 implies that something is 'unfinished' or regrettable due to the action described by the 「て」-form verb. While directly translating to \"I'm sorry,\" it can also be understood as highlighting the speaker's regret or unfinished feelings about a situation.",
