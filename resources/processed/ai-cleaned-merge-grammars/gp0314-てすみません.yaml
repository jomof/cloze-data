        "function": "Expresses apology or regret for an action.",
        "nuance": "Specifically indicates that the preceding action (expressed in te-form) is the cause or reason for the apology. It implies a sense of responsibility for the consequence."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てすみません」 comes from the combination of the te-form 「て」, which indicates a reason or cause, and 「すみません」, meaning \"I'm sorry\". 「すみません」 itself comes from the verb 「済む」 (sumu), meaning \"to finish\" or \"to settle\". So, literally, 「てすみません」 implies that something is not yet settled or resolved due to the preceding action, and the speaker is expressing regret for that situation. This can be likened to the English idiom of 'having unfinished business' or 'things not being settled right' because of something one did.",
    "writeup": "「てすみません」 is a grammar construction used to express regret about something. It can be translated as \"I'm sorry for [doing something]\". The 「て」-form indicates the specific reason or cause for the apology, while 「すみません」 expresses the apology itself. It implies that the action or situation has led to an unresolved or uncomfortable issue for which the speaker feels responsible. While it directly translates to \"I'm sorry,\" it is more precise to understand it as highlighting the speaker's regret or lingering feelings about a particular action, conveying that sense of 'unfinished business' to the person being apologized to. This nuance makes it a more direct and action-oriented apology compared to general apologies.",
