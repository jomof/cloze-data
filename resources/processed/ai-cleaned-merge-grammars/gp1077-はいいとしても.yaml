    "formation": {
        "Noun + はいいとしても": "Indicates that while a noun is acceptable, another aspect is problematic.",
        "Verb (plain form) + のはいいとしても": "Expresses that while a verb's action or state is acceptable, another related issue is not.",
        "I-Adjective (plain form) + のはいいとしても": "Concedes that an i-adjective's quality is acceptable, but a different aspect is problematic.",
        "Na-Adjective (stem) + な のはいいとしても": "Acknowledges that a na-adjective's quality is acceptable, but a related issue is not.",
        "Noun + である のはいいとしても": "Grants that being a certain noun (status/identity) is acceptable, but a related action or consequence is problematic."

    "jlpt": "N1",
    "meaning": "Even if acceptable; granted that; might be acceptable, but; while X is fine, Y is not",
    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "nuance": "Expresses a qualified acceptance, where one aspect is conceded while another is questioned or opposed. It implies that the first point is either genuinely acceptable or tolerated for the sake of argument, but the second point is a significant drawback or problem that cannot be overlooked.",
        "source": "DOJG (Dictionary of Japanese Grammar)",
        "grammatical-role": "Conjunction-like phrase",
        "logical-flow": "Establishes a point of agreement or concession before introducing a contrasting, problematic point.",
        "temporal-flow": "Indicates a concession that holds true at the time of consideration or generally, contrasting with a present or ongoing problem.",
        "spatial-flow": "Does not inherently specify spatial flow."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「はいいとしても」 is formed by combining 「は」 (a topic marker indicating contrast or focus), 「いい」 (an i-adjective meaning 'good' or 'acceptable'), and 「としても」 (a conditional conjunction meaning 'even if' or 'even though'). Together, they construct a pattern that first acknowledges something as acceptable, then introduces a contrasting, unacceptable element. It literally translates to 'even if [topic] is good/acceptable'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「はいいとしても」 is used to articulate that while one thing is acceptable or granted, another aspect is not. It conveys a sense of qualified acceptance, where the speaker acknowledges one point but raises an issue with another. This structure is often employed to express a complaint or dissatisfaction, where the speaker is willing to concede on one minor point to highlight a more significant problem. It is similar to saying \"even if...still...\" or \"granted that..., but...\". This grammar point is versatile and can be used in various contexts, from casual conversations to more formal discussions. The nuance it adds implies that something is 'fine' or 'acceptable', but not fully satisfactory due to the contrasting element.",

        {
            "japanese": "遅刻 は {いい としても}、無断欠席 は 許されない。",
            "english": "Being late is one thing, but unexcused absence is unforgivable.",
            "english_literally": "Lateness, even if it is good/acceptable, unexcused absence is unforgivable.",
            "scene": "A strict manager explaining workplace rules to a new employee. The employee has a history of tardiness but has now started not showing up at all without warning.",
            "scene_rationale": [
                {
                    "competing_grammar": "遅刻 は 大丈夫 だ けど、無断欠席 は 許されない。",
                    "mitigation": "「大丈夫だけど」 is too casual and simply states a fact, lacking the formal concession and implicit criticism found in 「はいいとしても」. The scene emphasizes a formal workplace setting where precise language is expected."
                }
            ],
            "register": "formal",
            "setting": "serious",
            "nuance": "The phrase 「許されない」 emphasizes the severe and unforgivable nature of the unexcused absence, making it clear that while lateness might be tolerated to some extent, absence without notice is completely unacceptable in a professional setting. This use of a strong negative conveys the manager's firm stance."
        },
        {
            "japanese": "料理 の 腕 は {いい としても}、後片付け を しない のは 困る。",
            "english": "Even if your cooking skills are good, it's troublesome that you don't clean up afterwards.",
            "english_literally": "Cooking skill, even if it is good/acceptable, not doing cleanup is troublesome.",

                    "competing_grammar": "料理 の 腕 は いい けど、後片付け を しない のは 困る。",
                    "mitigation": "「いいけど」 offers a simple contrast but doesn't convey the sense of 'conceding a point' as effectively as 「はいいとしても」. The scene focuses on a mild but persistent grievance, where the speaker reluctantly accepts the good but points out the bad."
                }
            ],
            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "friendly",
            "nuance": "The use of 「困る」 expresses a difficulty or nuisance rather than severe anger, indicating a common domestic complaint. This phrasing is typical when expressing mild dissatisfaction in an ongoing relationship, where one wants to address an issue without being overly confrontational."

                    "competing_grammar": "部屋 が 狭い けど、窓 が ない のは 耐えられない。",
                    "mitigation": "「狭いけど」 is a straightforward conjunction, but 「狭いのはいいとしても」 specifically implies that the small size is *conceded* as acceptable under certain conditions. The scene highlights a crucial deal-breaker, where the first point is accepted but the second is not."
                }
            ],
            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "cautious",
            "nuance": "「耐えられない」 signifies an absolute limit of endurance or tolerance. This strong negative expression highlights that while a small room is a minor inconvenience that can be accepted, the lack of a window is a fundamental issue that makes the living space unbearable for the speaker."

                    "mitigation": "「構わないけど」 can imply indifference or a lack of concern, whereas 「いいとしても」 implies a more formal acknowledgment or allowance. The scene emphasizes a professional context where communication is key, and the leader is explicitly stating a rule violation."

            "nuance": "The term 「無責任だ」 (irresponsible) is a strong accusation, reflecting the speaker's frustration and the violation of an implied duty. This kind of direct, evaluative language is common in a team or professional setting where individuals are expected to uphold certain responsibilities."

                    "mitigation": "「気まぐれだけど」 is a simple contrasting conjunction. 「気まぐれなのはいいとしても」 implies that the speaker has made a conscious decision to tolerate the 'whimsical' trait, setting up a stronger contrast with the 'problematic' behavior. The scene implies a deeper level of acceptance of the first trait."

This phrase accurately captures the sentiment of tolerating a personality quirk but finding a breach of trust unacceptable. The use of 「問題だ」 reinforces the seriousness of the latter point."
