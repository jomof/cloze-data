    "writeup": "The grammar point 「はいいとしても」 is used to express that while one thing is acceptable or granted, another aspect is not. It conveys a sense of qualified acceptance, where the speaker acknowledges one point but raises an issue with another. It's similar to saying \"even if...still...\" or \"granted that..., but...\". This grammar point is versatile and can be used in various contexts, from casual conversations to more formal discussions.  The nuance it adds can often be translated to something being \"fine\" or \"acceptable\", but still not fully satisfactory.",
    "etymology": "「は」 is a topic marker. 「いい」 means \"good\" or \"acceptable\". 「としても」 means \"even if\" or \"even though\". Combined, they create a structure where something is acknowledged as acceptable, but a condition or reservation is introduced.",
