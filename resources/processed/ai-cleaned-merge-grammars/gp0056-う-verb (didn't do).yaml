meaning: Indicates that an action or state did not occur in the past.

  instead.

jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  usage-context: general use
etymology: The negative past tense is derived from the negative auxiliary verb ない, which itself originates
  from older forms like ぬ or ん. By attaching the past tense auxiliary た (which becomes かった when preceded
  by い, as ない ends in い), the construction なかった emerged. The polite form ませんでした developed from the negative
  polite form ません combined with the past auxiliary でした. This structure effectively combines the negation
  of an action with its completion in the past.
writeup: |-
  The negative past form of Godan verbs (also known as u-verbs) is used to express that an action or state did not occur in the past. There are three primary forms:

  *   **Casual (～なかった)**: To form this, change the final kana of the Godan verb to its corresponding あ-sound kana (e.g., 飲む (nomu) becomes 飲ま (noma), 立つ (tatsu) becomes 立た (tata)). If the verb ends in う, it changes to わ (e.g., 買う (kau) becomes 買わ (kawa)). Then, attach なかった. For example, 飲む (nomu) becomes 飲まなかった (nomanakatta - didn't drink).

  *   **Semi-polite (～なかった です)**: This form builds upon the casual negative past by simply adding です. For instance, 飲まなかった です (nomanakatta desu). While not strictly grammatically standard in classical Japanese, it is widely used and accepted in modern colloquial Japanese, especially when speaking to someone you respect but with whom you have a somewhat close relationship.

  *   **Polite (～ませんでした)**: For the polite form, change the final kana of the Godan verb to its corresponding い-sound kana (e.g., 飲む (nomu) becomes 飲み (nomi), 立つ (tatsu) becomes 立ち (tachi)). Then, attach ませんでした. For example, 飲む (nomu) becomes 飲みませんでした (nomimasendeshita - didn't drink).

  An important exception to note is the verb ある (aru), which means "to exist" or "to be" for inanimate objects. Its casual past-negative form is simply なかった (nakatta), not あらなかった (aranakatta). However, its polite past-negative form follows the regular pattern: ありませんでした (arimasendeshita).
false_friends:
  - term: 〜ていません
    meaning: have not done
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike the negative past tense for Godan verbs, 「～ていません」 implies a state that began in the
      past and continues to the present, or an action that has not yet been completed. It focuses on the
      current state resulting from a past action, not merely the non-occurrence of an action in the past.
    grammar_point: まだ～ていません (still haven't done)
  - term: 〜ませんでしたか
    meaning: Didn't you...?
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike the negative past tense for Godan verbs which makes a statement, 「～ませんでしたか」 is a question
      asking if someone didn't do something. It implies seeking confirmation or expressing mild surprise.
    grammar_point: か (question)
  - term: い-Adjective (past negative)
    meaning: was not (i-adjective)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While structurally similar by ending in 「なかった」, this applies to i-adjectives to describe a
      past state of non-existence of that quality, not a past non-occurrence of an action performed by
      a verb.
    grammar_point: い-Adjective (past negative)
  - term: じゃなかった
    meaning: was not (noun/na-adjective)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This form is used to negate nouns or な-adjectives in the past tense. It describes a past state
      of being 'not something' or 'not a certain quality', rather than a past action that did not occur.
    grammar_point: じゃなかった (was not)
post_false_friends_writeup: The form 「～ていません」 indicates a continuous state resulting from a past action,
  whereas this grammar point simply describes an action that did not occur in the past. Also, take care
  to distinguish statements using this grammar point from interrogative sentences using the form 「～ませんでしたか」.
  Furthermore, while 「なかった」 is part of the negative past form for verbs, it is also used for the negative
  past of い-adjectives (e.g., 寒くなかった - wasn't cold) and as 「じゃなかった」 for nouns and な-adjectives (e.g.,
  学生じゃなかった - wasn't a student; 静かじゃなかった - wasn't quiet). Ensure you understand the part of speech being
  modified to use the correct grammatical structure.

    setting: informative
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    nuance: The use of 「全然」 (zenzen - entirely, completely) paired with the negative form strengthens
      the statement, indicating a complete absence of barking. This is a common casual observation style.
post_example_writeup: As illustrated in the examples, the choice of negative past form largely depends
  on the level of politeness required by the social context and relationship between speakers. Remember
  the irregular form of 「ある」 when negating its past existence.
