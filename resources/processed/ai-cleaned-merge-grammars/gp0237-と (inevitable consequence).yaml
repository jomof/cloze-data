details:
  part-of-speech: conjunction
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Used to describe situations where a specific action or state always leads to a predictable
    and inevitable outcome. It implies a cause-and-effect relationship that is objective and undeniable.
  function: Connects two clauses, where the first clause states a condition and the second clause describes
    the automatic or certain result of that condition.
  nuance: Stronger than other conditionals (ば, たら, なら) in implying certainty. It indicates a direct, immediate,
    and unavoidable consequence. Often used for universal truths, natural phenomena, directions, or habitual
    actions with consistent results. It cannot be used for hypothetical situations or where the speaker
    wants to express a command, request, or personal will in the result clause (B clause).
  grammatical-role: Subordinating conjunction, connecting a conditional clause to a main clause.
  logical-flow: 'Implies a fixed, logical sequence: ''If A, then always B.'''
  temporal-flow: The event in the first clause (A) is immediately followed by the event in the second
    clause (B), or B is a constant state resulting from A.
etymology: The particle 「と」 originally indicated a co-occurrence or simultaneity. Its use as a conditional
  evolved from this, implying that when one thing happens, another invariably follows. This connection
  to simultaneity underlies its strong sense of inevitability in conditional contexts.
writeup: "The 「と」 conditional expresses a natural, predictable, or inevitable consequence. Think of it\
  \ as \"when A happens, B *always* happens.\" It is stronger than other conditional forms like 「ば」, 「たら」,\
  \ or 「なら」 because it highlights a result that is considered a given. \n\nIt is primarily used for:\n\
  \n*   **General truths or natural phenomena:** Things that are universally true or always occur under\
  \ certain conditions (e.g., \"When spring comes, flowers bloom.\").\n*   **Directions or instructions:**\
  \ Describing a sequence of actions with guaranteed, automatic outcomes (e.g., \"If you turn the key,\
  \ the engine starts.\").\n*   **Habitual actions:** Describing actions that consistently lead to the\
  \ same outcome (e.g., \"When I get home, I always take a bath.\").\n*   **Discoveries:** Describing\
  \ what one finds upon doing something, implying an immediate and expected result (e.g., \"When I opened\
  \ the box, there was a cat inside.\").\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The 「と」 conditional describes\
  \ something inevitable or natural. It **cannot** be used for hypothetical situations, expressing personal\
  \ will, commands, requests, or suggestions in the result clause. For these, other conditional forms\
  \ are necessary. For example, you cannot say 「ボタン を 押す と、座り な さい。」 ('If you press the button, sit down.').\n\
  *   The verb in the 「と」 clause is always in the non-past form, even if referring to a past event whose\
  \ consequence was immediately observed. The tense of the overall action is indicated in the result clause.\n\
  *   Its inherent meaning of an automatic, certain consequence sets it apart from other conditional forms,\
  \ making it suitable for scientific explanations, instruction manuals, or describing fixed routines."
false_friends:
  - term: ば (conditional)
    meaning: If (conditional)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ば」 expresses a more general conditional; the result is not necessarily guaranteed to be automatic
      or immediate. It can imply the speaker's judgment or a stronger logical deduction rather than an
      an automatic consequence.
    grammar_point: ば (conditional)
  - term: たら (if・when・after)
    meaning: If; when; after
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たら」 implies that the result is discovered after the action in the first clause is completed,
      or a past conditional. It can be used for hypothetical situations and allows for expressions of
      speaker's will or command in the result clause.
    grammar_point: たら (if・when・after)
  - term: なら (conditional)
    meaning: If; if it's the case that; as for
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「なら」 is used when the condition is based on information the speaker has just learned or assumed,
      often implying 'if that's the case, then...'. It typically refers to specific circumstances rather
      than general truths.
    grammar_point: なら (conditional)
  - term: もしも (strong hypothetical if)
    meaning: If (for emphasis)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「もし」 is an adverb used to emphasize a conditional, usually preceding 「ば」, 「たら」, or 「なら」. It
      is not used with 「と」 because 「と」 already implies certainty.
    grammar_point: もしも (strong hypothetical if)
  - term: すると (and then・as a result)
    meaning: And then; upon doing that
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「すると」 describes a sequence of events, often implying an immediate and perhaps surprising follow-up
      action or discovery, similar to 「と」 in some contexts. However, it can also function as a discourse
      marker and does not always imply the same strict cause-and-effect as the conditional 「と」.
    grammar_point: すると (and then・as a result)
  - term: ごとに (each・every)
    meaning: Each time; every time; whenever
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「と」 describes an automatic, inevitable consequence, 「ごとに」 emphasizes the repetition
      or regularity of an event, implying "every time X happens, Y also happens." It focuses on the frequency
      rather than the logical necessity.
    grammar_point: ごとに (each・every)
  - term: てから (after and since)
    meaning: After doing; once...is done; since
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「てから」 indicates a sequential action where the second action occurs *after* the first one is
      completed. Unlike 「と」, it does not necessarily imply an immediate or inevitable consequence, nor
      does it typically describe universal truths or natural phenomena. It simply states a chronological
      order.
    grammar_point: てから (after and since)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「ば」, 「たら」, and 「なら」 can all translate to "if," they carry different
  nuances than 「と」. Choose 「と」 when the outcome is predictable and almost certain, often describing universal
  truths, natural phenomena, or habitual actions. For hypothetical or uncertain situations, or when expressing
  personal will, then opt for one of the other conditionals. 「もし」 is an adverb that precedes other conditionals
  for emphasis and is not used with 「と」. Furthermore, 「ごとに」 emphasizes repetition rather than inevitability,
  and 「てから」 simply denotes chronological sequence, not automatic consequence like 「と」 does.
examples:
  - english: When you press this button, the light turns on.
    japanese:
      - この ボタン を 押す と、明かり が つき ます。
      - この ボタン を 押す と、明かり が つく。
    english_literally: This button pressing, the light turns on.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この ボタン を 押し たら、明かり が つき ます。
        english: When you press this button, the light turns on.
        hint: 「たら」 describes a consequence that follows an action, but it doesn't necessarily imply the
          same universal, automatic cause-and-effect relationship that 「と」 does. We're looking for a general
          rule.
    scene: Explaining to someone how a common household appliance works.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The first sentence, using 「つきます」, maintains a polite tone appropriate for instructing someone.
      The second, using 「つく」, is casual. The use of 「と」 emphasizes the reliable, automatic result when
      the button is pressed, regardless of formality. The scenario suggests an older male instructing
      a younger female.
    etymology: 「明かり」 means 'light' or 'illumination'. 「つきます」 is the polite form of 「つく」 (to turn on/be
      lit).
  - english: When I wake up in the morning, I first drink coffee.
    japanese:
      - 朝 起きる と、まず コーヒー を 飲み ます。

          - 朝 起き たら、まず コーヒー を 飲み ます。
          - 朝 起きれ ば、まず コーヒー を 飲み ます。
        english: When I wake up in the morning, I first drink coffee.
        hint: 「たら」 or 「ば」 could indicate a general conditional, but they don't strongly convey the fixed,
          habitual routine implied by 「と」. We're looking for an automatic, consistent sequence of actions.
    scene: A man describing his consistent daily routine to a friend.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker describes a fixed, habitual action. The first sentence, with 「飲みます」, is polite,
      suitable for a general observation. The second, with 「飲む」, is casual, appropriate for speaking to
      a close friend. 「と」 emphasizes the consistent, almost involuntary nature of this action.
    etymology: 「まず」 means 'first' or 'to begin with'.
  - english: When I opened the door, there was a cat.
    japanese:
      - ドア を 開ける と、猫 が い た。
      - ドア を 開ける と、猫 が い まし た。
    english_literally: Door opening, cat was there.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ドア を 開け たら、猫 が い た。
        english: When I opened the door, there was a cat.
        hint: 「たら」 is also used for discoveries after an action, but 「と」 emphasizes the immediate and
          direct nature of the consequence, often implying a 'sudden' or 'automatic' occurrence upon the
          action. We're looking for a quick and direct realization.
    scene: A woman telling a surprising story about what she found immediately upon entering her apartment.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「と」 conveys an immediate, direct consequence or discovery upon performing the action.
      The first sentence, ending with the casual 「いた」, is typical for storytelling among close acquaintances.
      The second, ending with the polite 「いました」, is suitable for a slightly more formal recounting. This
      expresses an unmediated, direct observation.
    etymology: 「開ける」 (あける) means 'to open'. 「猫」 (ねこ) means 'cat'.
  - english: If it's hot, you sweat.
    japanese:
      - 暑い と、汗 が 出 ます。
      - 暑い と、汗 が 出る。
    english_literally: Hot, sweat comes out.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 暑かっ たら、汗 が 出 ます。
          - 暑けれ ば、汗 が 出 ます。
        english: If it's hot, you sweat.
        hint: While 「たら」 or 「ば」 could be used for a general conditional, 「と」 is specifically chosen for
          universal truths or natural phenomena where the outcome is always guaranteed. We're looking
          for a natural law.
    scene: A doctor explaining a normal physiological response to a patient.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: This sentence describes a universal truth. The version using 「出ます」 maintains a polite and
      informative tone, suitable for formal settings. The version using 「出る」 is a casual way to state
      the same fact. 「と」 is used to convey a scientific or general fact about the body's reaction to heat.
    etymology: 「汗」 (あせ) means 'sweat'. 「出ます」 (でます) is the polite form of 「出る」 (でる), meaning 'to come out'
      or 'to appear'.
  - english: If the traffic light is red, cars stop.
    japanese:
      - 信号 が 赤い と、車 は 止まり ます。
      - 信号 が 赤い と、車 は 止まる。
      - 信号 が 赤い と、車 が 止まり ます。
      - 信号 が 赤い と、車 が 止まる。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 信号 が 赤けれ ば、車 は 止まり ます。
          - 信号 が 赤い なら、車 は 止まり ます。
        english: If the traffic light is red, cars stop.
        hint: 「ば」 or 「なら」 can set a condition, but 「と」 is preferred for fixed rules and automatic outcomes,
          like traffic laws, where the consequence is always the same. We're looking for a rule that always
          applies.
    scene: An instructor explaining basic traffic rules to a new driver.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    nuance: This sentence describes a fixed rule or natural law. Both 「車 は 止まります」 and 「車 が 止まります」 are
      polite forms; the former topicalizes 'cars' while the latter simply states the action. Their casual
      counterparts are also included. 「と」 conveys the automatic response required by law, making it suitable
      for instructional settings.
    etymology: 「信号」 (しんごう) means 'traffic light' or 'signal'. 「止まります」 (とまります) is the polite form of 「止まる」
      (とまる), 'to stop'.
  - english: If you are honest, people will trust you.
    japanese:
      - 正直 だ と、人 は 信用 し て くれ ます。
      - 正直 だ と、人 は 信用 し て くれる。
      - 正直 だ と、みんな が 信用 し て くれ ます。
      - 正直 だ と、みんな が 信用 し て くれる。
    english_literally: Honest, people trust you.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 正直 だっ たら、人 は 信用 し て くれ ます。
          - 正直 で あれ ば、人 は 信用 し て くれ ます。
        english: If you are honest, people will trust you.
        hint: 「たら」 or 「ば」 can express a general condition for trust, but 「と」 emphasizes this as a universal,
          almost axiomatic truth about human nature. We're looking for a general principle.
    scene: A teacher giving life advice to their students.
    register: formal
    setting: inspirational
    nuance: This sentence expresses a universal truth about human behavior. Both polite (ending in 「信用してくれます」)
      and casual (ending in 「信用してくれる」) forms are provided, and both 「人 は」 and 「みんな が」 are natural ways
      to refer to 'people' in this context. The use of 「と」 emphasizes the unfailing consequence of honesty,
      making it suitable for an inspirational or didactic context.
    etymology: 「正直」 (しょうじき) means 'honest'. 「信用」 (しんよう) means 'trust' or 'credit'.
  - english: If it's noisy, I can't concentrate.
    japanese:
      - うるさい と、集中 でき ませ ん。
      - うるさい と、集中 でき ない。
    english_literally: Noisy, concentration cannot do.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - うるさかっ たら、集中 でき ませ ん。
          - うるさけれ ば、集中 でき ませ ん。
        english: If it's noisy, I can't concentrate.
        hint: 「たら」 or 「ば」 could express this condition, but 「と」 highlights a consistent, automatic inability
          to concentrate whenever it's noisy. We're looking for a habitual, unavoidable reaction.
    scene: A student explaining why they need a quiet study environment.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: reflective
    nuance: This expresses a personal but consistent consequence of noise. The version using 「できません」 is
      polite, suitable for explaining a personal difficulty to someone you are not very close to. The
      version using 「できない」 is casual, more for close friends or internal thought. 「と」 describes a reliable
      pattern in the speaker's ability to concentrate.
    etymology: 「うるさい」 means 'noisy' or 'annoying'. 「集中」 (しゅうちゅう) means 'concentration'.
  - english: If you are a student, you get a discount.
    japanese:
      - 学生 だ と、割引 が あり ます。
      - 学生 だ と、割引 が ある。
    english_literally: Student, discount exists.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 学生 なら、割引 が あり ます。
        english: If you are a student, you get a discount.
        hint: 「なら」 is suitable for conditions based on a stated fact, but 「と」 specifically states a general
          rule or policy where the discount is an automatic outcome of being a student. We're looking
          for a fixed policy.
    scene: A shop assistant informing a customer about a special offer.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: This is a direct, factual statement about a condition and its guaranteed outcome. The version
      with 「あります」 is polite, standard for customer service or informing others. The version with 「ある」
      is casual. 「と」 emphasizes the automatic nature of the discount given the student status, common
      in informational contexts.
    etymology: 「学生」 (がくせい) means 'student'. 「割引」 (わりびき) means 'discount'.
  - english: When it is spring, cherry blossoms bloom.
    japanese:
      - 春 だ と、桜 が 咲き ます。
      - 春 だ と、桜 が 咲く。
      - 春 だ と、桜 は 咲き ます。
      - 春 だ と、桜 は 咲く。
    english_literally: Spring, cherry blossoms bloom.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 春 なら、桜 が 咲き ます。
          - 春 に なっ たら、桜 が 咲き ます。
        english: When it is spring, cherry blossoms bloom.
        hint: While 「たら」 or 「なら」 might imply a general conditional, 「と」 specifically describes a natural,
          annual occurrence where the blooming is an inevitable result of spring's arrival. We're looking
          for a natural, seasonal certainty.
    scene: A tourist guide pointing out a natural seasonal phenomenon.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: This describes a natural, annual event. The polite forms 「桜 が 咲きます」 and 「桜 は 咲きます」 are suitable
      for general informational contexts, with the former focusing on the blooming itself and the latter
      topicalizing 'cherry blossoms'. Their casual counterparts are also included. 「と」 highlights the
      undeniable link between spring and the blooming of cherry blossoms.
    etymology: 「桜」 (さくら) means 'cherry blossom'. 「咲きます」 (さきます) is the polite form of 「咲く」 (さく), 'to bloom'.
  - english: When the sun sets, it gets dark.
    japanese:
      - 日 が 暮れる と、暗く なり ます。
      - 日 が 暮れる と、暗く なる。
    english_literally: Sun sets, dark becomes.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 日 が 暮れ たら、暗く なり ます。
          - 日 が 暮れれ ば、暗く なり ます。
        english: When the sun sets, it gets dark.
        hint: 「たら」 or 「ば」 could describe a general conditional, but 「と」 emphasizes this as an automatic,
          universal natural phenomenon that always occurs. We're looking for an absolute natural occurrence.
    scene: A parent explaining natural daily phenomena to a young child.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    nuance: This sentence conveys a universal, natural phenomenon. The version using 「なります」 is polite,
      appropriate for teaching basic facts or general statements. The version using 「なる」 is casual. The
      use of 「と」 stresses the inevitability of darkness following sunset.
    etymology: 「日 が 暮れる」 (ひ が くれる) means 'the sun sets' or 'it gets dark'. 「暗く なる」 (くらく なる) means 'to
      become dark'.
post_example_writeup: Remember that 「と」 is used when the result is almost guaranteed and automatic, often
  describing universal truths, natural phenomena, or habitual actions. For hypothetical or uncertain situations,
  or when expressing personal will, other conditional forms like 「ば」 or 「たら」 are more appropriate.
