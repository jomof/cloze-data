    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にかかわる」 is derived from the verb 「関わる(かかわる)」, meaning \"to be involved with, to be related to\". The addition of 「に」 before 「かかわる」 creates a set phrase that emphasizes the connection or relationship between the preceding noun and the subsequent statement.",
    "writeup": "When grouped with に, the う-Verb 関わる \"to be concerned with\" is frequently used to show a relation between (A) and (B). This grammar pattern may be translated as \"relating to (A), (B)\", \"concerning (A), (B)\", or \"(B) that has to do with (A)\". This structure appears after nouns and is occasionally followed directly to a second noun to modify its meaning. It is most common to see this pattern in its non-kanji form.\n\nThis grammar pattern may also highlight that (A) is something the speaker should be cautious about due to a potential negative outcome.\n\n**Important Consideration**: Despite being similar to に関する, 「にかかわる」 implies a deeper, more important relationship between (A) and (B), so they are not completely interchangeable.",
