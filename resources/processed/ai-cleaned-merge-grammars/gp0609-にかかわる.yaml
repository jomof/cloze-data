    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にかかわる」 comes from the verb 「関わる(かかわる)」, which means \"to be involved,\" \"to be related to,\" or \"to concern.\" The addition of 「に」 adds a nuance of direction or purpose, indicating that something is related to or has an impact on the preceding noun.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「にかかわる」, often written in hiragana, indicates a relationship between two things, A and B. It can be translated as \"relating to A, B,\" \"concerning A, B,\" or \"B that has to do with A.\" It is used after nouns and can directly modify another noun. It's **important** to note that 「にかかわる」 implies a deeper and more significant connection than 「に関する」. It can also imply that A is something to be cautious about due to potential negative outcomes.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene emphasizes the internal, existential stress a student feels about the exam, pushing towards the deeper \"life depends on it\" nuance of `にかかわる` rather than a general \"important for my life.\""
