    "etymology": "「中 (naka)」 meaning \"inside\" or \"middle,\" combined with the particle 「を (o)」 which marks the object of a verb or, in this case, the space or path through which an action occurs. Together, they indicate performing an action within, on, or through a specified location, situation, or time.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「中を」 (naka o) combines the noun 「中」, meaning \"inside,\" \"middle,\" or \"amidst,\" with the particle 「を」. This particle marks the space, path, or area through which an action takes place, or the situation or period in which an action is performed. Therefore, 「中を」 expresses the idea of performing an an action **within**, **on**, **into**, **through**, or **amidst** a specified context. It is important to note that while 「中を」 often implies motion or presence *inside* something, the action itself, or the actor, may not be entirely contained. For instance, with verbs like 「覗く」 (nozoku, \"to peek\"), 「中を」 indicates peeking *into* an enclosure, rather than physically entering it. This grammar point can be used with various parts of speech to indicate the encompassing environment for an action, whether physical or abstract.",

In contrast, 「ところを」 points to an action happening *at a specific point* or *critical juncture* within a situation, often implying an particular timing or an interruption. 「のに」, on the other hand, is a simple conjunction meaning 'despite' or 'although', and does not carry the same spatial or temporal nuance of being 'within' or 'through' a condition. When considering static location, 「で」 marks the place where an action occurs, while 「に」 indicates a destination or location of existence. Neither conveys the sense of traversal or being encompassed *through* something like 「中を」. Similarly, 「の中」 describes the *static* internal location, whereas 「中を」 implies an action that interacts with or moves through that internal space.",
