    "etymology": "「中 (naka)」 meaning \"inside\" or \"middle,\" combined with the particle 「を (o)」 which marks the object of a verb or, in this case, the space or path through which an action occurs. Together, they indicate performing an action within, on, or through a specified location, situation, or time.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「中を」 (naka o) combines the noun 「中」, meaning \"inside,\" \"middle,\" or \"amidst,\" with the particle 「を」. This particle marks the space, path, or area through which an action takes place, or the situation or period in which an action is performed. Therefore, 「中を」 expresses the idea of performing an action **within**, **on**, **into**, **through**, or **amidst** a specified context. It is important to note that while 「中を」 often implies motion or presence *inside* something, the action itself, or the actor, may not be entirely contained. For instance, with verbs like 「覗く」 (nozoku, \"to peek\"), 「中を」 indicates peeking *into* an enclosure, rather than physically entering it.",
