    "etymology": "The grammar point 「中を」 is derived from the noun 「中」 (naka), meaning \"inside,\" combined with the particle 「を」 (o), which typically marks the direct object but in this case, indicates the place through which an action occurs.",
    "writeup": "「中を」 is used to indicate the place *in*, *on*, *into*, or *inside of* where an action is taking place. 「中」 itself means \"inside.\" The particle 「を」 usually marks a direct object, but here it specifies the location where the action occurs. The action is described by the verb, while the location is indicated by the noun marked with 「中を」. It can express doing something *in* a certain space, *on* a certain surface, *into* a specific area, or *inside* an enclosed object. The subject performing the action might not always be physically located within the noun marked by 「中を」; for instance, peering *into* something.",
