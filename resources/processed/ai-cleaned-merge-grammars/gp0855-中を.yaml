        "part-of-speech": "phrase",

        "usage-context": "Used to describe an action occurring within, through, or amidst a specified location, situation, or time. Often implies movement or progression through that space or state.",
        "function": "Specifies the spatial or temporal domain in which an action takes place.",
        "nuance": "While often implying physical movement inside or through something, it can also refer to being amidst a state or period. It emphasizes the encompassing environment or duration of the action.",
        "source": "Derived from the noun 「中 (naka)」 (inside, middle) and the particle 「を (o)」 (marking path or object of action).",
        "colocation": "Commonly used with verbs of movement (e.g., 歩く, 走る, 潜る) or verbs implying observation into an enclosed space (e.g., 覗く). Can also be used with nouns describing a general situation or time (e.g., 雨の中, 忙しい中)."
    },
    "etymology": "「中 (naka)」 meaning \"inside\" or \"middle,\" combined with the particle 「を (o)」 which marks the object of a verb or, in this case, the space or path through which an action occurs. Together, they indicate performing an action within, on, or through a specified location, situation, or time.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「中を」 (naka o) combines the noun 「中」, meaning \"inside,\" \"middle,\" or \"amidst,\" with the particle 「を」. This particle marks the space, path, or area through which an action takes place, or the situation or period in which an action is performed. Therefore, 「中を」 expresses the idea of performing an action **within**, **on**, **into**, **through**, or **amidst** a specified context. It is important to note that while 「中を」 often implies motion or presence *inside* something, the action itself, or the actor, may not be entirely contained. For instance, with verbs like 「覗く」 (nozoku, \"to peek\"), 「中を」 indicates peeking *into* an enclosure, rather than physically entering it. This grammar point can be used with various parts of speech to indicate the encompassing environment for an action, whether physical or abstract.",

            "nuance": "While 「中を」 emphasizes performing an action *within* or *through* a state/period (e.g., busy, rainy), 「ところを」 specifies performing an action *at the precise moment* of another event or state. For example, 「忙しいところを」 implies interrupting someone *just as* they are busy, whereas 「忙しい中を」 implies doing something *despite* or *through* a period of being busy."

            "nuance": "「中を」 focuses on the physical or temporal environment an action occurs *within* or *through*. 「のに」 functions as a concessive particle, expressing that something happens *despite* a preceding condition, often with a sense of dissatisfaction or surprise. While both can express a state that accompanies an action, 「中を」 highlights the encompassing nature of that state, whereas 「のに」 highlights the unexpected outcome given the state."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "Both 「中を」 and 「ところを」 can denote conditions or situations. However, 「中を」 describes an action occurring *throughout* or *amidst* a duration or space, suggesting continuity or an encompassing environment. In contrast, 「ところを」 points to an action happening *at a specific point* or *critical juncture* within a situation, often implying an particular timing or an interruption. 「のに」, on the other hand, is a simple conjunction meaning 'despite' or 'although', and does not carry the same spatial or temporal nuance of being 'within' or 'through' a condition.",
