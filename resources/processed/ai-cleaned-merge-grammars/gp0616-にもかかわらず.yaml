    "etymology": "にもかかわらず is derived from the verb 拘わる (kakawaru), meaning \"to be involved with, to be affected by.\" The ず (zu) is an archaic negative auxiliary verb. Thus, the literal meaning is closer to \"without being affected by.\" It is similar in meaning to のに (noni).",
    "writeup": "**にもかかわらず** is a formal grammar structure used to convey that something is \"in spite of (A)\" or \"despite (A).\" It is similar in meaning to のに. It combines に, も, the verb 拘わる (kakawaru) \"to be fixated on\", or \"to stick to\", and the literary auxiliary verb ず (zu), which carries the same meaning as ない (nai). This structure connects to verbs, い-adjectives, and nouns in their plain forms. In most cases, this pattern appears without kanji. **Important:** Do not confuse **にもかかわらず** with に関わらず (ni kakawarazu). The former expresses \"despite\", while the latter is used more often for \"regardless of\" or \"no matter if.\"",
