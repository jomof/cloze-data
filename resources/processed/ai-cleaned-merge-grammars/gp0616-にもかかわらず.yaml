    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にもかかわらず」 is derived from 「に」 (particle), 「も」 (particle), the verb 「拘わる(かかわる)」 (to be involved, to be affected by), and 「ず」 (archaic negative auxiliary verb). Literally, it means \"without being affected by...\"",
    "writeup": "「にもかかわらず」 is a formal Japanese grammar structure used to convey that something happens \"despite\" or \"in spite of\" a certain condition or situation. It indicates that an unexpected outcome occurs, irrespective of a preceding circumstance. This pattern is a combination of the particle 「に」, the particle 「も」, the verb 「拘わる(かかわる)」, meaning \"to be involved\" or \"to be affected by,\" and the archaic negative auxiliary verb 「ず」, which functions similarly to 「ない」. Literally, this phrase expresses \"without being affected by (A), (B)\" or \"without fixating on (A), (B)\". While it is often interchangeable with 「のに」, 「にもかかわらず」 carries a more formal tone and is suitable for more professional or objective discourse. It typically connects to verbs, い-adjectives, and nouns in their standard forms. It is important to note that 「にもかかわらず」 most frequently appears without kanji. Be careful not to confuse it with 「にかかわらず」; 「にもかかわらず」 means \"despite,\" whereas 「にかかわらず」 typically means \"regardless of\" or \"no matter if.\"",
