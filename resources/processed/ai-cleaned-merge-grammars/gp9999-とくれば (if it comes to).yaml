jlpt: N1
etymology: The と particle here likely derives from its function of introducing a condition or a quoted
  statement, leading to an expected result. 来れば (くれば) is the ば-form of 来る (くる, to come), literally meaning
  'if it comes.' So, 'if it comes to (X)' or 'when (X) comes into consideration,' implying a natural progression
  to the expected outcome. It expresses that if a certain situation or topic 'comes' to be discussed,
  then a particular outcome or characteristic naturally follows.
writeup: |-
  `とくれば` is a versatile grammar pattern used to introduce a topic or condition and state an expected or typical consequence that follows. It carries the nuance of 'when it comes to X, then naturally Y' or 'given X, it's expected that Y.' This pattern implies a strong, often inherent, connection between the preceding clause and the succeeding statement. It can be used in both positive and negative contexts, often leading to a logical or typical conclusion. For instance, when talking about a certain person, `とくれば` can introduce an action or trait that is characteristic of them. When discussing a situation, it can indicate a predictable result.

  While often translated as 'if it comes to,' the `と` here functions more like a conditional or quotative marker, and `くれば` is the conditional form of `来る` (to come), literally 'if it comes.' The combination creates a sense of 'when the topic/situation arrives, then...'

  It is generally used in speech and writing that leans towards a semi-formal or formal register, but it is not overly stiff. It's a useful expression for making observations about inherent qualities or predictable patterns.
false_friends:
  - term: 〜となると
    meaning: When it comes to X, then Y (implying a change in situation or focus).
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`〜となると` often implies a shift in context or a consequence that arises *because* a certain
      situation is realized. It can introduce a new perspective or a logical conclusion that follows from
      the preceding information. While `とくれば` emphasizes a predictable, inherent characteristic or outcome,
      `〜となると` focuses on a consequence that *arises* when a specific condition is met, sometimes with
      a sense of inevitability or critical juncture.'
    grammar_point: となると (when it comes to)
  - term: なら
    meaning: If A (then B); As for A.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`なら` is a general conditional, often used when responding to a previous statement or setting
      a hypothetical condition. It''s broader and less specific than `とくれば`. `とくれば` suggests a *typical*
      or *expected* outcome tied to the specific subject, whereas `なら` simply states a condition.'
    grammar_point: なら (conditional, if it's the case that A)
  - term: について・〜に関して
    meaning: About; regarding.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: These simply introduce a topic for discussion without implying a specific consequence or expectation,
      which `とくれば` always does.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:について・〜に関して (about・regarding)
post_false_friends_writeup: While `とくれば`, `〜となると`, and `なら` all deal with conditionals or establishing
  context, their nuances differ significantly. `とくれば` is used to highlight an **expected, inherent outcome**
  based on a particular topic or individual. It often implies a 'given X, then naturally Y' scenario.
  `〜となると` suggests a **logical consequence or change of situation** when a certain condition is met, often
  implying a critical juncture or a new focus. `なら` is a more general conditional, often used for **hypothetical
  statements or responding to a previous comment**. Finally, `について・〜に関して` simply **states the topic**
  of discussion without implying any expected outcome or consequence. Pay attention to the underlying
  sense of expectation and inherent typicality when choosing `とくれば`.
