jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: General
etymology: This grammar point combines the quotative particle 「と」 with 「聞いた」, the past tense of 「聞く」 (kiku),
  meaning "to hear." This literally forms the phrase "I heard that." The use of 「と」 here functions to
  introduce the quoted or reported content, much like quotation marks, making the entire phrase a direct
  statement about having received information.
writeup: 「ときいた」 is a versatile expression used to convey information that the speaker has learned from
  an external source. It implies that the speaker is relaying information they received, rather than stating
  a personal observation or an undisputed fact. This makes it particularly useful for attributing information
  or discussing hearsay.While typically used in formal or semi-formal contexts, 「ときいた」 can also appear
  in casual conversation. A common stylistic feature in informal speech is the omission of the copula
  「だ」 (da) when it follows nouns and な-adjectives immediately before 「ときいた」. Although widely accepted
  and natural-sounding in casual settings, this omission is not considered strictly grammatically correct
  in more formal writing or speech. This grammar point primarily functions to report information that
  has been heard by the speaker, emphasizing the act of reception.

  - term: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems・I hear)'
    meaning: Seems like, Apparently, I heard
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「らしい」 often implies an inference or general belief based on observation or indirect evidence,
      whereas 「ときいた」 is a more neutral statement indicating direct reception of information.
    grammar_point: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems・I hear)'
  - term: そうだ (hear that)
    meaning: I heard that, It is said that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「そうだ」 can also mean "I heard that," but it often implies a more direct or immediate source
      of information, or a general report. 「ときいた」 focuses on the speaker's personal act of hearing.
    grammar_point: そうだ (hear that)
  - term: ようだ
    meaning: It seems that, It appears that, It looks like
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ようだ」 expresses the speaker's judgment based on observation or conjecture, focusing on appearance.
      In contrast, 「ときいた」 is solely based on information received from someone else, without requiring
      direct observation.
    grammar_point: ようだ (it seems)
  - term: んだって
    meaning: I heard that, He or She said that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「んだって」 is a more casual and colloquial way of saying "I heard that," often used among close
      friends or in informal settings. 「ときいた」 is generally more versatile and can be used in both casual
      and formal contexts.
    grammar_point: んだって・だって (I heard)
  - term: だって (even, too)
    meaning: I heard/was said, Because, But, Even or also, Even if or even though
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「だって」 has various meanings, including "I heard," but it frequently carries connotations of
      justification or excuse. 「ときいた」 is a straightforward statement of having received information, without
      such additional implications.
    grammar_point: だって (even・too)
post_false_friends_writeup: These expressions all convey information that has been heard, but their nuances
  and appropriate usage contexts differ. When choosing among them, consider the speaker's relationship
  with the listener, the formality of the situation, and the nature of the information's source. 「ときいた」
  is generally a safe and neutral option for simply stating information you've heard. For casual conversation,
  「んだって」 offers a more colloquial feel, while 「らしい」 and 「そうだ」 imply varying degrees of inference or general
  reporting. 「だって」 often introduces a reason or counter-argument, making it less suitable for a neutral
  report of information.

    register: formal
    setting: supportive

      more approachable and less demanding, characteristic of polite, considerate speech.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, 「ときいた」 is quite versatile. It can be used in
  a range of registers, from casual to formal, and in various settings. The key is its emphasis on the
  speaker having received the information directly, rather than inferring it or presenting it as widely
  known. This directness makes it a valuable phrase for attributing information or sharing news that has
  come to your attention.
