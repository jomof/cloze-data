jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used to convey information that the speaker obtained by hearing it from someone else,
    or from a specific source. It implies a direct report of the information.
  function: Reports information acquired through hearing, often implying a specific or identifiable source.
  nuance: This expression indicates that the speaker has directly 'heard' the information. It is often
    used when the source is known or implied, giving a sense of factual reporting. It's less about speculation
    and more about relaying communicated information.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a predicate indicating reported speech.
etymology: The expression combines the quotation particle 「と」 (to), which marks the preceding clause as
  a direct or indirect quote, and the past tense of the verb 「聞く」 (kiku), meaning 'to hear' or 'to ask'.
  Thus, 「と聞いた」 literally translates to 'heard that [clause]', directly reflecting its function of reporting
  information acquired aurally.
writeup: |-
  「と聞いた」 is a fundamental expression used to report information that the speaker has heard. It is a straightforward way to attribute a piece of information to a source, whether it be a specific person or a general rumor. Unlike some other hearsay expressions, 「と聞いた」 often implies a more direct acquisition of the information, as if you personally heard it from someone or read it in a specific report.

  This phrase is versatile and can follow various plain forms of verbs, adjectives, and nouns. It directly states that 'I heard (that)...' and is useful in both casual and more formal settings, depending on the politeness level of the verb 聞く (e.g., 聞きました for polite, 聞いた for casual). In highly formal or humble contexts, the humble form 「伺いました」 (ukagaimashita) can be used.

  - term: '[Sentence]そうだ (i heard・it is said)'
    meaning: I heard that / It is said that (general hearsay)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そうだ」 is used for general hearsay, often implying that the information is widely known or
      reported, such as in news or weather forecasts, without specifying a direct source. It can also
      indicate appearance.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Sentence]そうだ (I heard・it is said)
  - term: 〜らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)
    meaning: It seems that / I hear that (based on evidence or impression)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「らしい」 suggests that the speaker is conveying information based on indirect evidence, strong
      inference, or a general impression, rather than a direct statement heard from someone. It carries
      a nuance of 'it appears to be the case.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:〜らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)
  - term: って (quotation marker, casual)
    meaning: I heard that (casual quotation)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「って」 is a very casual equivalent of 「と」, often used in spoken Japanese to relay information
      that was heard. It doesn't imply a formal or specific source, and can also be used for direct quotes.
    grammar_point: って (quotation marker, casual)
  - term: んだって (I heard, casual)
    meaning: I heard that (casual, often seeking confirmation)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「んだって」 is an even more casual form, often used when relaying something recently heard, and
      can carry a nuance of surprise or seeking confirmation, like 'Oh, I heard that, is that true?'
    grammar_point: んだって (I heard, casual)
post_false_friends_writeup: While all these expressions relate to conveying information that has been
  heard, 「と聞いた」 is unique in its directness, often implying a personal act of hearing or receiving information
  from a specific, albeit sometimes unnamed, source. 「そうだ」 (for hearsay) and 「らしい」 are more about general
  reports or impressions. 「って」 and 「んだって」 are casual spoken forms, with 「んだって」 often conveying a sense
  of fresh information or a request for confirmation.

post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, the politeness of 「と聞いた」 can be adjusted by conjugating
  「聞く」 to 「聞きました」 for polite speech, or even using the humble form 「伺いました」 when speaking to a superior
  or in more formal situations. The core meaning of relaying heard information remains consistent across
  these variations.
