    "etymology": "The word 「すると」 is derived from the verb 「する」 (to do) and the conjunction particle 「と」, and is considered an abbreviation of 「そうすると」 (if you do that).",
    "writeup": "「すると」, combining 「する」 and the conjunction particle 「と」, is generally an abbreviation of 「そうすると」 and means \"once (A) is done, (B),\" or \"upon (A), (B).\" 「すると」 usually starts a new sentence, highlighting an occurrence due to the circumstances in the previous sentence. As a standalone statement, 「すると」 is a conjunction.\n\nThe \"result\" 「すると」 conveys should be one of two things:\n\n*   Something the speaker has no control over.\n*   A conclusion/determination the speaker wants to confirm is correct, based on their understanding of the previous statement.\n\nWhen 「すると」 draws a conclusion about another person's statement, it's closer to \"so you mean to say (A)\" or \"if so, then (A).\"",
