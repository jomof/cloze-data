    "etymology": "すると is derived from the verb する (to do) and the conjunction particle と. The と indicates a condition or a moment when something happens. Therefore, すると literally means \"if/when (something) is done\" but it functions as a conjunction to connect related events or inferences.",
    "writeup": "すると is a conjunction used to connect two sentences where the second sentence describes an event that happens immediately after the event in the first sentence, often unexpectedly. It can also express a logical guess or conclusion based on the first sentence. Think of it as \"and then,\" \"thereupon,\" or \"if so.\" It often implies a cause-and-effect relationship, though not always a direct or intended one. It is generally considered an abbreviation of そうすると.",
