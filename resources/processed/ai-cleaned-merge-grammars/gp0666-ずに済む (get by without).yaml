formation:
  Verb, negative plain form without 'ない' + ずに + 済む: To get by without doing something, To get away with
    not doing something
jlpt: N2
etymology: The grammar point 「ずに済む」 is composed of 「ず」, an old-fashioned literary negative auxiliary verb
  similar to 「ない」, 「に」, a particle, and 「済む(すむ)」, a verb meaning "to finish," "to be completed," or "to
  get by". So, 「ずに済む」 literally means "to finish without doing something." The core meaning revolves around
  'sumu' (済む) signifying completion or resolution, which, when combined with the negative 'zu' (ず), implies
  that a certain action did not need to be performed for the situation to resolve favorably.
writeup: |-
  「ずに済む」 is a grammatical construction used to express that one was able to "get by without doing (A)" or that "it's no problem without (A)." This structure signifies that a potentially undesirable or burdensome action was successfully avoided, often resulting in a sense of relief for the speaker.

  The construction comprises 「ず」, a classical auxiliary verb that functions similarly to 「ない」, followed by the particle 「に」, and finally the verb 「済む (すむ)」, meaning "to be finished," "to be completed," or "to get by."

  Literally, the phrase can be understood as "it will resolve or work out without (A) being done." The 「ず」 component attaches to verbs in the same manner as 「ない」, indicating the action that is being negated or avoided.

  While 「ずに済む」 is a common and versatile expression, variations such as 「ないで済む」 or 「なしで済む」 are also encountered. 「ないで済む」 is a more colloquial and direct equivalent using the modern negative form 「ない」. 「なしで済む」 is particularly useful when referring to the absence of a noun rather than a verb, as 「無し (なし)」 functions as a suffix meaning "without" and can attach directly to nouns.

  In most applications, the action (A) that is avoided is typically something considered unpleasant, troublesome, or a burden, which underscores the speaker's relief or satisfaction in its successful circumvention.

  - term: ずに
    meaning: without doing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ずに」 simply indicates performing an action 'without' another, 「ずに済む」 specifies that
      a particular action was successfully avoided, resulting in a favorable outcome or relief. 「ずに」 alone
      doesn't carry the implication of an avoided burden.
    grammar_point: ずに・ないで・ことなく (without doing)
  - term: ないで済む
    meaning: to get by without doing (colloquial)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ないで済む」 is a direct and more colloquial counterpart to 「ずに済む」, using the modern negative form
      「ない」. While often interchangeable in daily conversation, 「ずに済む」 can feel slightly more formal or
      established.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ないで済む (get by without doing)
  - term: なしで済む
    meaning: to get by without (something)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「なしで済む」 specifically applies when the avoided element is a noun, indicating the absence of
      an item or condition. It cannot be used with verb forms in the same way as 「ずに済む」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:なしで済む (get by without something)
  - term: なくてもいい
    meaning: don't have to do; it's okay not to do
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「なくてもいい」 (or 「なく て いい」 colloquially) simply states that an action is not required or is permissible
      to omit. It lacks the implication of successful avoidance of an undesirable task or the sense of
      relief often associated with 「ずに済む」.
    grammar_point: なくてもいい (no need to)
  - term: 必要がない
    meaning: there is no need to do
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「必要 が ない」 expresses a neutral lack of necessity or requirement. It does not carry the implication
      of avoiding an inconvenience or the feeling of relief that 「ずに済む」 does. It's a factual statement,
      not an expression of fortunate avoidance.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:必要がない (there is no need to)
  - term: ずにはいられない
    meaning: cannot help but do
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「ずに済む」 implies successfully *avoiding* an action, 「ずにはいられない」 expresses an unavoidable
      compulsion to do something, often due to strong emotion or a situation. They both use the 「ずに」 form,
      but with opposite outcomes and implications regarding control over the action.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-ない form]ずにはいられない・ないではいられない (cannot help but do)'
post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  While 「ずに」 simply means "without doing," 「ずに済む」 adds the nuance of successfully avoiding something, often implying a sense of relief. For instance, 「朝ご飯 を 食べ ず に 学校 へ 行った」 (I went to school without eating breakfast) is a neutral statement of fact. In contrast, 「朝ご飯 を 食べ ず に 済んだ」 (I got by without eating breakfast) implies that skipping breakfast was not a problem or was even a good thing in that situation.

  「ないで済む」 is a more colloquial and common variant of 「ずに済む」, carrying essentially the same meaning. 「なしで済む」 is specifically used when avoiding a noun (e.g., 「エアコン なし で 済む」 - 'get by without air conditioning'), whereas 「ずに済む」 is for avoiding an action.

  Finally, 「なくてもいい」 and 「必要 が ない」 both indicate a lack of necessity. However, they are more neutral and do not convey the same sense of relief or successful avoidance of an undesirable task that is central to 「ずに済む」. 「ずに済む」 suggests a fortunate outcome where an action that might have been expected or troublesome was averted.

      the goal *without* performing the action, highlighting a personal commitment or realization. The
      formal polite form 「済み ませ ん」 makes it more deferential, while 「済む わけ に は いか ない」 is another way to
