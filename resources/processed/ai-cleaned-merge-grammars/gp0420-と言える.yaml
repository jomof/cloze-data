    "etymology": "The grammar point 「と言える」 is a combination of the particle 「と」 (to), which here indicates a quote or content, and 「言える」(ieru), which is the potential form of the verb 「言う」(iu, to say). The potential form indicates ability, possibility, or capability. Thus, 「と言える」 literally means 'can say that' or 'it can be said that.'",
    "writeup": "「と言える」 is a common expression derived from the potential form of the verb 「言う」, meaning \"to say.\" It conveys the idea that something *can* be said, implying that it's a reasonable or justifiable statement. It often expresses a general idea or belief held by the speaker.\n\nThe particle 「と」 functions in its citation use, allowing 「と言える」 to follow a direct phrase or statement. It is commonly paired with grammar patterns like 「だろう」 or 「でしょう」, softening the tone by acknowledging the listener's perspective. For example, 「と言えるだろう」 can be translated as \"Can we not say (A)?\" or \"(A) can be said, right?\"\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   While the speaker generally holds confidence in their statement when using 「と言える」, the use of a conjecture form suggests openness to being wrong, softening the overall tone.\n*   Using the auxiliary verb 「よう」 with the potential form of 「言う」 creates a stronger phrase, similar to \"Let it be said that (A).\"",
