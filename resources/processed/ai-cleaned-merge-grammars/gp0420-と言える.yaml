    "writeup": "「と言える」is a common expression using the potential form of the verb 「言う」 \"to say\", highlighting that something can be said. This phrase expresses a general idea the speaker believes to be correct. 「と言える」 translates as \"it is fair to say (A)\", or \"one could say (A)\". As the case marking particle 「と」 is used in its citation use, 「と言える」 may follow any direct phrase/statement.\n\n「と言える」 is often paired with grammar patterns like 「だろう」 or 「でしょう」. This makes the statement more friendly by considering the listener's thoughts. 「と言えるだろう」 can be translated as \"can we not say (A)?\", or \"(A) can be said, right?\".\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nWhen the potential form of 「言う」 is linked with the auxiliary verb 「よう」, it creates a stronger phrase similar to \"let it be said that (A)\".\n\nThe speaker is usually relatively confident about their statement when using 「と言える」, but the use of a form that expresses conjecture shows they are open to being wrong, softening the tone.",
    "etymology": "「と言える」is derived from the verb 「言う」(iu, to say) and the potential form 「言える」(ieru, can say). The 「と」particle indicates the content that is being said.",
