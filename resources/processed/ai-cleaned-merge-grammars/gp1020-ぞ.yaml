    "writeup": "**ぞ** is a sentence-ending particle primarily used by men to add strong emphasis to a statement, functioning similarly to an exclamation point. While **よ** gently asserts a point, **ぞ** is more forceful and direct. It's frequently used to encourage oneself or to strongly assert something to others. Although less common, **ぞ** can also act as an adverbial particle to highlight a topic, even question words, adding emphasis. Its primary use is by men, and overuse can sound overly assertive. It's not generally appropriate for women to use.",
    "etymology": "The etymology of ぞ is not definitively known, but it's believed to have evolved from older Japanese particles used to express assertion or emphasis. Over time, it has become associated with masculine speech patterns.",
