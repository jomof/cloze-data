        "usage-context": "Used to add strong emphasis, assertion, or a sense of resolve. Primarily used by male speakers. Can also highlight a preceding noun or question word.",
        "function": "Emphasizes the preceding statement or word, conveying a strong sense of conviction, declaration, or urgency.",
        "nuance": "Stronger and more direct than よ. Can sound forceful or confrontational if overused or used inappropriately. Often conveys a personal resolution or a strong, direct assertion to others.",
        "grammatical-role": "Sentence-ending particle or adverbial particle."
    },
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「ぞ」 is believed to stem from older Japanese particles used for assertion and emphasis. In classical Japanese, similar emphatic particles like 「こそ」 and 「なむ」 existed, and 「ぞ」 shares some historical connections, evolving into a direct assertive particle. Its strong association with masculine speech in modern Japanese is a relatively recent development, reflecting shifts in social language use where more direct and forceful expressions became gender-specific.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「ぞ」 is used at the end of sentences to add strong emphasis or assertion. It is primarily used by men and conveys a sense of conviction, determination, or urgency. While 「よ」 offers a softer, more informative emphasis, 「ぞ」 is more direct and forceful, akin to adding multiple exclamation points in English. It can be used for self-encouragement, a strong declaration to others, or even to express strong emotion like triumph or exasperation.\n\nBeyond sentence-ending use, 「ぞ」 can also function as an adverbial particle, similar to 「は」, to highlight a preceding noun or question word. In this usage, it strongly emphasizes the word it follows, making the statement or question more intense.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **Gendered Usage:** 「ぞ」 is strongly associated with male speech. Its use by women is very rare and generally considered unnatural or highly aggressive.\n*   **Formality:** It almost exclusively attaches to plain forms of verbs and adjectives. It is not typically used with polite forms (～ます, ～です).\n*   **Tone:** Overuse of 「ぞ」 can make a speaker sound overly assertive, confrontational, or aggressive. Its use should be carefully considered based on context and relationship with the listener.",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「ぞ」, 「よ」 is less forceful and can be used by both men and women to indicate emphasis or draw attention to a point. 「よ」 is more about informing or confirming, whereas 「ぞ」 is about asserting or declaring.",

While both 「ぞ」 and 「ぜ」 are masculine, 「ぞ」 can feel more like a declaration of one's own state or intent, whereas 「ぜ」 is often more about delivering a strong point to someone else.",
