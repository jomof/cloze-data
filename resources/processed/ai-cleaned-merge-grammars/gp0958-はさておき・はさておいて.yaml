        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "semi-formal",
        "usage-context": "General usage",
        "nuance": "Used to explicitly dismiss a topic or set it aside to focus on something deemed more important or relevant. It implies a conscious decision to shift the conversation or focus.",
        "colocation": "Often precedes a statement that introduces the main point or topic the speaker wishes to discuss.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions adverbially, modifying the entire subsequent clause by indicating a shift in focus or exclusion of a preceding topic."
    },
    "etymology": "The expression 「はさておき」 is composed of 「は」 (the topic particle), 「さて」 (meaning \"well then\" or \"now\"), and 「おき」 which is the conjunctive form of the verb 「置く」 (oku) meaning \"to put\" or \"to place\". Literally, it suggests \"putting (something) aside for now.\" The original meaning of 「さて」 as a discourse marker for changing topics, combined with 「置く」 for physically setting something down, naturally evolved into its current function of mentally setting a topic aside.",
    "writeup": "「はさておき」 is an expression frequently translated as \"leaving aside (A)\" or \"apart from (A).\" This phrase functions to signal a speaker's intention to dismiss a current topic or issue in favor of addressing something more pressing or relevant. It's a deliberate rhetorical device to redirect the conversation.\n\nThe structure is a combination of the topic particle 「は」, the conjunction 「さて」, and the conjunctive form 「置き」 of the verb 「置く」 (おく, to place or to leave). While 「さて」 can occasionally be seen in kanji forms like 扨 or 扠, this is quite rare. Similarly, 「置く」 might sometimes be replaced with 「措く」 (おく, to set aside, arrange), particularly in more formal or classical contexts, though 「置く」 is standard.\n\nThis grammar point is primarily used to transition away from a topic that the speaker considers less important, irrelevant, or perhaps too sensitive, towards a discussion of what truly matters. It can directly follow nouns, such as in 「冗談はさておき」, a common set expression meaning \"jokes aside\" or \"moving on to serious business.\" \n\nAnother frequent usage involves following a phrase that ends with 「かどうか」. In this context, 「〜かどうかはさておき」 can be translated as \"regardless of whether it is (A) or not,\" implying that the subsequent statement (B) is a more appropriate or crucial point to address, thereby encouraging the listener to move past the initial consideration (A).",

            "nuance": "This example uses 「細かい問題」 (minor issues) with 「はさておき」 to emphasize prioritizing the 「全体の計画」 (overall plan), indicating a practical and task-oriented approach. The polite volitional 「立てましょう」 suggests a collaborative effort."

                    "mitigation": "While 'にかかわらず' also means 'regardless of,' 'はさておき' implies a more active, deliberate setting aside of the appearance to focus on something else, which is conveyed by the speaker's shift in focus in the scene."
