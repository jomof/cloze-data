    "etymology": "The grammar point 「はさておき」 is derived from 「さて」, meaning \"now\" or \"well then,\" indicating a transition to a new topic, and 「置く(おく)」, meaning \"to put\" or \"to place.\" The 「はさておいて」 variation uses the te-form of 「置く」.",
    "writeup": "「はさておき」 is used to set aside a previous topic in order to move on to something more important. It combines the topic marker particle 「は」, the adverb 「さて」 (meaning \"now,\" indicating a shift in focus), and the conjunctive form (置き/おいて) of the verb 「置く」 (to put, place, or leave). This structure is used when the speaker wants to shift away from topic A to discuss topic B, which they consider more relevant or pressing. It often directly follows nouns. It can also follow a phrase ending in 「かどうか」, meaning \"regardless of whether it is A or not, B,\" implying that B is the more appropriate topic. 「冗談はさておき」 is a set phrase meaning \"jokes aside\" or \"moving on to serious business.\"",
