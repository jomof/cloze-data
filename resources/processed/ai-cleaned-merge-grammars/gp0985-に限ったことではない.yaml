        "usage-context": "Used to indicate that something is not exclusive to a particular thing or situation."
    },
    "etymology": "The core of this grammar point lies in the verb 「限る」 (kagir-u), meaning 'to limit' or 'to restrict'. Historically, this verb has been used to define boundaries or scope. The formation 「に限ったことではない」 combines this concept of limitation with a negation: 「に」 indicates the scope of the limitation, 「限った」 is the past tense (implying a completed action of limiting), 「こと」 literally means 'thing' or 'matter' but here functions as a nominalizer for the preceding clause, and 「ではない」 negates the entire proposition. Thus, it literally means 'it is not a matter that is limited to [X]', evolving to express that 'X is not the only case' or 'it extends beyond X'. This construction emphasizes that a given situation or characteristic is not unique or exclusive to the mentioned subject, implying a broader applicability.",
    "writeup": "「に限ったことではない」 is a phrase used to express that something is not exclusively true for a particular person, thing, or situation. It conveys that the condition, problem, or observation extends beyond the initially mentioned subject, implying a broader or more widespread applicability. While its literal translation is 'it is not a thing/matter that is limited to (A)', its practical meaning is closer to 'not limited to (A)', 'not only (A)', or 'not restricted to (A)'. This grammar point is commonly used when discussing observations, trends, or issues that might seem specific to one case but are, in fact, more universal or frequent. It adds an emphatic nuance, suggesting that the listener should consider the broader context. Although often encountered in formal or semi-formal settings, such as academic discussions or news reports, it can also appear in casual conversation to emphasize a shared experience or commonality, as demonstrated in some of the examples. It typically follows a noun or a noun phrase. It is crucial to understand that the phrase implies the mentioned item (A) is not an isolated or exceptional case; rather, it is part of a larger pattern.",

        {
            "term": "だけではない",
            "meaning": "not only, not just",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「だけではない」 is a more direct and often simpler way to say 'not only'. Unlike 「に限ったことではない」, it does not carry the nuance of a wider, more general truth or that the specific instance is not special or should not be treated as such. It merely states that something else is also true."

        {
            "term": "のみならず",
            "meaning": "not only, but also; in addition to",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「のみならず」 is a more formal and literary expression, often used in written Japanese or formal speeches. It emphasizes the addition of another element, conveying 'not only A, but also B'. While similar in meaning to 「に限ったことではない」, it lacks the specific nuance of 'not being restricted to' a particular case, implying a broader, less exceptional situation."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To distinguish between these expressions, consider the emphasis. While 「だけではない」 simply states that something is not exclusive, 「に限ったことではない」 implies that the given situation is not unique or special, suggesting it is a more common or widespread phenomenon. 「のみならず」, on the other hand, is a more formal way to add another element, indicating 'in addition to' or 'moreover'.",
