    "etymology": "The grammar point is derived from the verb 「限る(かぎる)」 (to limit), combined with the particle 「に」, the past tense form 「限った」, the noun 「こと」 (thing, matter), the particle 「は」, and the negative form of the copula 「ない」. Literally, it means \"it is not a thing limited to...\".",
    "writeup": "「に限ったことではない」 is a fairly emphatic expression indicating that something is not limited or unique to a particular case. It's a combination of 「に」, the past tense of 「限る」 (to limit), 「限った」, the noun 「こと」 (thing), the adverbial particle 「は」, and the adjective 「ない」. The literal translation is \"it is not something that is limited to (A),\" but common interpretations include \"not only (A), but also (B),\" or \"not restricted to (A), (B) too.\" This structure follows nouns and is typically used in formal situations. It suggests that (A) isn't especially rare and shouldn't be treated as such.",
