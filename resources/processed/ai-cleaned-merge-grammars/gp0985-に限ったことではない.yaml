        "[Noun] + に限ったことではない": "Indicates that something is not limited to a specific thing or situation."

        "Register": "Formal",
        "Usage": "Used to indicate that something is not exclusive to a particular thing or situation."
    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the verb 「限る(かぎる)」 (to limit), combined with the particle 「に」, the past form 「限った」, the noun 「こと」, the particle 「は」, and the negative form of the adjective 「ない」. It literally means \"it is not something that is limited to (A)\".",
    "writeup": "「に限ったことではない」 is a fairly emphatic expression indicating that something is not limited or exclusive to a particular case. It uses the verb 「限る (かぎる)」, meaning \"to limit\". The expression translates to \"it is not something that is limited to (A)\", suggesting that (B) is also true or applicable. This grammar point often suggests that (A) is not rare or shouldn't be treated specially. It's used following nouns and is more common in formal situations, indicating that something isn't unique to a specific case.",
