    "etymology": "The particle 「の」 originally indicated possession or belonging, but it evolved to also function as a nominalizer, turning adjectives into nouns. The 「は」 part is the topic marker particle.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「の」 can act as a pronoun, replacing a noun that has already been mentioned or one that is understood from context. It's similar to \"the one that is (A)\" in English. When a な-adjective precedes 「の」, use 「な」 before 「の」. This 「の」 is often followed by 「は」, 「が」, or 「も」, depending on what the speaker wants to emphasize. Note that 「の」 may appear multiple times in the same sentence referring to the same noun.",
