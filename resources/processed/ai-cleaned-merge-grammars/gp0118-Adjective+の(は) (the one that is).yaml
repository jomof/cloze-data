        "usage-context": "Used to nominalize an adjective, referring to an implicit noun or thing that possesses the described quality. It functions like 'the one that is...' in English.",
        "function": "Nominalization of adjectives, allowing them to function as nouns or noun phrases.",
        "nuance": "This construction avoids repetition of nouns, allowing for a more concise and natural expression when referring to a specific item or concept based on its attribute. The implied noun is understood from context or previous mention.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a noun phrase in the sentence."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「の」 acts as a nominalizer, turning the preceding word or phrase into a noun. In this grammatical structure, it specifically nominalizes an adjective. The particle 「は」 is the topic marker, indicating what the speaker is focusing on. Other particles like 「が」 (subject marker) or 「も」 (also/too) can follow 「の」, depending on the desired grammatical role or nuance.",
    "writeup": "The grammatical pattern 「Adjective + の(は/が/も)」 is used to refer to a person or thing that possesses a particular adjectival quality, without explicitly stating the noun. The 「の」 acts as a nominalizer, effectively replacing a noun that has already been mentioned or is clearly understood from context.\n\nFor **い-adjectives**, you simply attach 「の」 directly to the adjective (e.g., 「高い の」, 「安い の」). For **な-adjectives**, you must insert 「な」 before 「の」 (e.g., 「きれい な の」, 「元気 な の」).\n\nFollowing 「の」, various particles can be used, with 「は」, 「が」, and 「も」 being the most common:\n*   **は**: Marks the nominalized adjective as the topic of the sentence.\n*   **が**: Marks the nominalized adjective as the subject of the sentence (often indicating new information or emphasis).\n*   **も**: Indicates 'also' or 'too', applying the statement to the nominalized adjective in addition to something else.\n\nThis construction is highly versatile and frequently used in everyday Japanese conversations to avoid redundancy and make sentences more fluid.",
