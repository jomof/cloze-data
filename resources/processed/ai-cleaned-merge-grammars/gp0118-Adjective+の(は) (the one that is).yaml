    "writeup": "The grammatical pattern 「Adjective + の(は/が/も)」 is used to refer to a person or thing that possesses a particular adjectival quality, without explicitly stating the noun.\n\nFor **い-adjectives**, you simply attach 「の」 directly to the adjective (e.g., 「高い の」, 「安い の」). For **な-adjectives**, you must insert 「な」 before 「の」 (e.g., 「きれい な の」, 「元気 な の」).\n\nFollowing 「の」, various particles can be used, with 「は」, 「が」, and 「も」 being the most common:\n\n*   **は**: Marks the nominalized adjective as the topic of the sentence.\n*   **が**: Marks the nominalized adjective as the subject of the sentence (often indicating new information or emphasis).\n*   **も**: Indicates 'also' or 'too', applying the statement to the nominalized adjective in addition to something else.\n\nThis construction is highly versatile and frequently used in everyday Japanese conversations to avoid redundancy and make sentences more fluid.",
