    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とは比べものにならない」 is composed of the particle 「と」, the adverbial particle 「は」, the established expression 「比べもの」 (kurabemono - 'a comparable thing'), the particle 「に」, and the negative form of the verb 「なる」 ('to become'), 「ならない」. Literally, this construction implies that 'X will not become a comparable thing to Y', thereby indicating a vast qualitative or quantitative difference. The term 「比べもの」 itself is a combination of the conjunctive form of the verb 「比べる」 ('to compare') and the noun 「もの」 ('thing'), suggesting 'something for comparison'.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「とは比べものにならない」 is used to emphatically express that something is vastly superior or inferior to another, to the extent that a meaningful comparison is impossible. It signifies that there is **no comparison** or that one item is **far greater/lesser than** another.\n\nThis phrase is typically used when you want to highlight a significant difference in quality, quantity, or some other measurable attribute. The item being compared to (the superior or inferior benchmark) is marked by the particle 「と」. The subject that is deemed incomparable to this benchmark often precedes the phrase, marked by 「は」 or implied.\n\nFor example, in the structure 「[劣るもの] は [優れるもの] とは比べものにならない」, the inferior item is explicitly stated to be nothing compared to the superior one.\n\nOccasionally, you may encounter an additional 「は」 before 「ならない」 (i.e., 「とは比べものにはならない」). This repetition of 「は」 serves to add further emphasis or highlight a sharper contrast, underscoring the impossibility of comparison.",
