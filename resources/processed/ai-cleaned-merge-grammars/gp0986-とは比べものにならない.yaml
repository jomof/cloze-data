    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とは比べものにならない」 is composed of 「と」 (a particle), 「は」 (a particle), 「比べもの」 (kurabemono - something comparable), 「に」 (a particle), and 「ならない」 (naranai - the negative form of 「なる」 - to become). Literally, it means something like \"(A) will not become a comparable thing,\" indicating that there is no basis for comparison due to a vast difference.",
    "writeup": "This grammar point, 「とは比べものにならない」, is used to emphatically express that something is incomparable to something else, highlighting a significant difference in quality, quantity, or degree. It's a strong way to say that \"there's no comparison\" between two things. The structure is used before a noun (B) that is being presented as superior to something else (A). The degree of difference is usually quite large, making any direct comparison meaningless. For even greater emphasis, the particle 「は」 can be used a second time before 「ならない」.",
