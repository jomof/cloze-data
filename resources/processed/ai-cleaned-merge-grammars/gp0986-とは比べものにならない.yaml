    "etymology": "This grammar point comes from 「比べる」(kuraberu, to compare) and 「物」(mono, thing). 「比べものにならない」 literally means 'cannot become a thing to be compared,' indicating that one thing is so much better or different that it's beyond comparison.",
    "writeup": "「とは比べものにならない」 is used to emphasize that something is **far beyond** what could possibly be compared to something else. It indicates a significant difference, often suggesting that one thing is much better or greater than the other. It combines the particle 「と」, the contrastive particle 「は」, the noun 「比べもの」 (a comparable thing), the particle 「に」, and the negative form of the verb 「なる」 (to become), resulting in a structure that means 'cannot become a comparable thing.' This pattern is typically used before nouns to emphasize that the noun is incomparable in quality, quantity, or some other measurable feature.",
