    "etymology": "っけ is derived from the question particle か. The added っ suggests a sense of remembering something not quite clear in one's memory.",
    "writeup": "っけ is a sentence-ending particle used in casual Japanese to express uncertainty or to seek confirmation. It's like saying \"wasn't it?\" or \"didn't we?\" in English. It's often used when you're trying to recall something or confirm information you're not entirely sure about.\n\nGenerally, it follows the past form of the auxiliary verbs だ or た (resulting in だっけ or たっけ). It can also be used with のだ or んだ to create verb phrases, though it's becoming more common among younger speakers to omit the んだ part, especially with verbs, though this is not considered grammatically correct in formal settings.\n\nYou can use っけ when asking yourself a rhetorical question or directly asking someone else.",
