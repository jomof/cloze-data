    "etymology": "The particle 「っけ」 is believed to have originated from 「か」, a question marker, combined with a preceding particle or auxiliary verb that softened the inquiry, suggesting a seeking of confirmation rather than a direct question.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「っけ」 is used in casual speech to confirm information you're unsure about or to recall something you've forgotten. It's similar to asking \"right?\" or \"wasn't it?\" in English. 「っけ」 often follows the past form of auxiliary verbs like 「だ」 or 「た」, appearing as 「だっけ」 or 「たっけ」. You'll also see it used with 「のだ」 or 「んだ」, allowing for a wider range of verb tenses. It's commonly used when speaking to oneself or directly asking someone else for confirmation. It is primarily used in casual conversation.",
