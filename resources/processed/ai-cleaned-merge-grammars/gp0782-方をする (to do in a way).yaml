jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: teineigo (polite)
  function: To express the manner, method, or characteristic style of an action, behavior, or a way of
    dealing with something.
  nuance: Emphasizes the *how* of an action rather than just the action itself. It can describe a person's
    inherent characteristic in how they perform tasks, or how they handle situations. It often implies
    a subjective evaluation or observation of that manner.
  colocation: Commonly collocates with adverbs such as 丁寧 (teinei - polite), 悪い (warui - bad), 早い (hayai
    - fast), 遅い (osoi - slow), or nouns like 話し方 (hanashikata - way of speaking), 食べ方 (tabekata - way
    of eating).
  grammatical-role: Functions as a verbal phrase modifying the verb する.
  temporal-flow: Can describe habitual actions (ongoing) or specific instances.
etymology: The phrase 「方をする」 combines 方 (かた), meaning 'way' or 'method', with the verb する (to do). Essentially,
  it means 'to do the way (of something)'. The noun 方 indicates the manner, and する acts upon it, making
  the manner itself the object of the verb. This highlights the focus on *how* an action is carried out
  or *what kind* of behavior is exhibited, rather than simply stating the action itself.
writeup: |-
  The grammar pattern 「方をする」 is used to describe the manner or characteristic way in which an action is performed, a situation is handled, or a quality is exhibited. It places emphasis on the *style* or *method* rather than just the action itself. It can be applied to describe how a person typically behaves, or how a specific task is carried out. This pattern allows for a nuanced description of an action by focusing on its qualitative aspects.

  This pattern is highly versatile. It can be used with verb stems (e.g., 話し方をする - to have a way of speaking), with nouns that describe methods or styles (e.g., 丁寧な方をする - to be polite in one's manner), or with nouns derived from adjectives describing qualities (e.g., 悲しそうな方をする - to act sorrowfully).

  When used with verb stems, the verb stem (連用形 - ren'yōkei) attaches directly to 方, forming a noun that means 'the way of [verb]ing'. For example, 読む (yomu - to read) becomes 読み方 (yomikata - way of reading). When you then add をする, it describes *doing* something in that specific 'way of reading'.

  When used with nouns, especially those indicating a characteristic or quality, the noun is connected with の, followed by 方をする. This construction often describes one's approach or style, such as the way someone talks or thinks.

  For adjectives, you typically convert the adjective into a noun using suffixes like 〜さ (for い-adjectives) or by directly using a noun that represents the quality, and then apply the 'Noun + の + 方をする' pattern. This allows describing the *manner* in which an emotional state or characteristic is displayed.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb-stem + 方
    meaning: the way of doing something (noun)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「Verb-stem + 方」 is a noun describing the *method* or *way* of doing something. 「Verb-stem
      + 方をする」 describes the *action* of behaving or doing something in that specific way. The latter focuses
      on the active performance of the manner.
    grammar_point: かた (way of doing)
  - term: Verb[volitional-よう]とする
    meaning: to try to do; to be about to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜ようとする」 expresses intention or an attempt to perform an action. It focuses on the will or
      immediacy of the action. 「方をする」 describes the *manner* of an action that is already being performed
      or is habitual, without necessarily implying an effort or intention.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[volitional-よう]とする (to try to・to not try to)
  - term: Verb[volitional-よう]にする
    meaning: to make an effort to; to try to ensure that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜ようにする」 implies a conscious effort or decision to establish a habit or ensure a certain outcome.
      It focuses on a continuous effort. 「方をする」 simply describes the observed or characteristic manner
      of an action, regardless of conscious effort.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-よう]にする (to make an effort to establish a habit)'
  - term: 仕方がない
    meaning: it can't be helped; there's no other way
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While sharing the character 方 (しかた), 「仕方がない」 is an idiom expressing resignation or inevitability.
      It has no direct relation to the *manner* of doing something. 「方をする」 is about the 'how' of an action,
      not its inevitability.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:仕方がない (it can't be helped)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'While 「方」 appears in several expressions, it''s crucial to distinguish 「方をする」
  which describes the *manner* of an action, from others. For instance, 「話し方」 (way of speaking) is a noun,
  but 「話し方をする」 means ''to speak in a certain way.'' Contrast this with 「〜ようとする」, which expresses an HINT:
  attempt, or 「〜ようにする」, which denotes a sustained effort. 「仕方がない」 uses the same kanji but means ''it can''t
  be helped,'' completely unrelated in meaning.'
