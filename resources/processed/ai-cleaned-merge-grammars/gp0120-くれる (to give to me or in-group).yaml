jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  register: semi-formal
  function: Indicates an action of giving towards the speaker or someone in their in-group.
  nuance: Highlights the benefit received by the speaker or their in-group, focusing on the giver's action.
etymology: The verb 「くれる」 originally comes from the verb 「呉る(くれる)」 which meant "to give" or "to grant".
  Over time, its meaning became specialized to indicate giving something specifically to the speaker or
  someone close to them. This historical development shows how the concept of 'granting a favor' evolved
  into the specific directional sense we see today.
writeup: |-
  「くれる」 is a fundamental verb in Japanese used to describe the act of giving. It is part of a crucial trio of verbs—「くれる」, 「あげる」, and 「もらう」—that define the direction of giving and receiving. Specifically, 「くれる」 is used when the action of giving is directed **towards the speaker** or **someone within the speaker's 'in-group'**. This 'in-group' typically includes family members, close friends, or colleagues within the same company or social circle. The perspective is always from the recipient's side, emphasizing the benefit received by the speaker or their group.

  In sentences using 「くれる」:
  *   The **giver** is marked with the particle 「が」 (ga).
  *   The **recipient** (which is usually the speaker or someone in their in-group) is marked with the particle 「に」 (ni).
  *   The **object** being given is marked with the particle 「を」 (o).

  Often, the giver or recipient may be omitted if they are clear from context. This grammatical structure highlights the action of giving and the benefit conferred upon the speaker or their close associates.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *   **In-Group vs. Out-Group:** The distinction between an 'in-group' and an 'out-group' is culturally significant in Japanese. 「くれる」 is reserved for actions benefiting your in-group. If you are giving something to someone outside your in-group, you would typically use 「あげる」 instead.
  *   **Perspective:** Unlike 「もらう」 (to receive), which focuses on the act of receiving, 「くれる」 emphasizes the giver's action. It implies that the giver performed a favor or act of kindness by giving.
  *   **Nuance of Gratitude:** While not explicitly stated, the use of 「くれる」 often carries an underlying nuance of gratitude, as it describes a beneficial action performed by someone else.
false_friends:
  - term: もらう
    meaning: To receive, To get, To obtain
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「もらう」 means "to receive" from someone, 「くれる」 describes the act of someone giving *to*
      the speaker or their in-group, focusing on the giver's action rather than the recipient's act of
      taking.
    grammar_point: もらう (to receive)
  - term: あげる
    meaning: To give (away), To present, To provide
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「あげる」 is used when giving to someone outside the speaker's in-group, or when the giving is
      not directly to the speaker. In contrast, 「くれる」 specifically indicates giving *to* the speaker or
      their in-group, emphasizing the benefit received.
    grammar_point: あげる (give away)
  - term: てくれる
    meaning: To do something for someone (usually you)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「てくれる」 is a grammatical pattern indicating that someone performs an action *for* the speaker's
      benefit. While it uses the verb 「くれる」, its meaning is broader, referring to a favor or service,
      whereas 「くれる」 alone typically refers to the act of giving an object.
    grammar_point: てくれる (receiving benefaction)
  - term: てくれてありがとう
    meaning: Thank you for ~ing (for me/us)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This phrase expresses gratitude for an action someone did for one's benefit, directly incorporating
      the 「てくれる」 form. It is a set expression of thanks, distinct from the verb 「くれる」 merely indicating
      a transfer of possession.
    grammar_point: てくれてありがとう (thank you for doing for me)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between 「くれる」, 「あげる」, and 「もらう」, the key is to consider
  the **direction of the action** and the **perspective**. 「くれる」 means someone gives *to me* or my in-group.
  「あげる」 means I give *to someone else*. 「もらう」 means I receive *from someone else*. Always pay attention
  to who is giving and who is receiving, and whether the recipient is part of the speaker's 'in-group'.
  The verb choice subtly conveys these social relationships.

          We're looking for the giver's action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 が 友達 に プレゼント を あげ た。
        english: I gave a present to my friend.
        hint: This sentence means 'I gave it to my friend,' which reverses the action. We're looking for

        english: I cannot receive money from my older brother, so I'm in trouble.

          - 兄 は 私 に お 金 を あげ ませ ん。
        english: My older brother does not give money to me (to someone else).

      feeling frustrated.

    nuance: The use of 「くれない」 here emphasizes the speaker's unmet expectation of their older brother,
      implying a slight resentment or disappointment. While 「もらえない」 would focus on the speaker's inability
      to receive, 「くれない」 directly attributes the problem to the brother's lack of giving, which can be
      seen as his failure to fulfill a familial role, especially from a younger sibling's perspective.

    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The plain imperative 「くれ」 is very direct and can sound harsh or demanding. It is often used

      on the listener's part, highlighting a dependency on their consideration.

        english: I gave freshly picked vegetables to my neighbor.
        hint: This sentence reverses the direction of the action, stating that the speaker gave something
          to the neighbor. We're looking for the neighbor giving to the speaker.
    scene: Someone recounting a pleasant interaction with their neighbor, highlighting the neighbor's
      generosity.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    nuance: The use of 「くれました」 emphasizes the neighbor's kind act of giving and the benefit derived by
      the speaker. It subtly conveys gratitude and appreciation for the neighbor's generosity, highlighting
      the positive impact of their action on the speaker.
post_example_writeup: Understanding the core concept of 「くれる」 as 'giving to me/my in-group' is crucial.
  While all examples use the specified formation, the nuance can shift significantly with different conjugations
  and contexts, from expressing simple facts to conveying subtle requests or disappointments. Pay close
  attention to the particles 「が」, 「に」, and 「を」 as they consistently mark the giver, recipient, and object,
  respectively.
