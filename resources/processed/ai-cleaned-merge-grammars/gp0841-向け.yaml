    "etymology": "「向け」 is derived from the transitive verb 「向ける (むける)」, meaning \"to turn towards\" or \"to aim at\". It has evolved into a suffix to indicate the target or intended recipient of something.",
    "writeup": "「向け」 is a suffix that indicates something is \"intended for,\" \"aimed at,\" or \"oriented toward\" a specific group or purpose. It's often used with nouns to describe products, services, or content designed for a particular audience. For example, 「子供向け (こどもむけ)」 means \"for children,\" and 「海外向け (かいがいむけ)」 means \"for overseas.\" While 「向け」 highlights the intended audience, it doesn't always mean that the item is *exclusively* for that audience.",
