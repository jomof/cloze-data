    "etymology": "向け is derived from the transitive verb 向ける (mukeru), meaning \"to turn towards, to aim at.\" It functions as a suffix attached to nouns to indicate the target or intended recipient.",
    "writeup": "向け (muke) is a suffix that attaches to nouns to express that something is \"intended for,\" \"aimed at,\" or \"oriented toward\" that noun. It indicates a specific target or purpose. While 向け highlights the intended audience, it doesn't necessarily restrict the use of the product or service only to that group. 向け comes from the transitive verb 向ける (mukeru, \"to turn towards, to aim at\"), and it is often used to describe products or services specifically designed for a certain demographic.  Be careful not to confuse it with 向き (muki), which comes from the intransitive verb 向く (muku, \"to face\"), indicating directionality rather than intent.",
