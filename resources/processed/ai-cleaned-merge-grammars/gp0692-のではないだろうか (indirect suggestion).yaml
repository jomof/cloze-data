  usage-context: General
etymology: This grammatical construction is a combination of several fundamental Japanese elements. 「の」
  (no) functions as a nominalizer, turning the preceding clause into a noun phrase, expressing a matter
  or a fact. 「では」 (de wa) is a combination of the particle で (indicating a state or condition) and the
  topic particle は. It forms the negative of the copula だ when followed by ない, meaning “is not.” 「だろう」
  (darō) is the plain form of the presumptive or conjectural auxiliary verb, indicating probability or
  conjecture, equivalent to “probably,” “might,” or “will likely.” Finally, 「か」 (ka) is the interrogative
  particle, turning the statement into a question. Literally, the phrase breaks down to “is it not probably
  the case that...?” This layered construction naturally creates an indirect, rhetorical question, softening
  the speaker's assertion and inviting agreement rather than making a direct statement. Its evolution
  reflects a linguistic tendency to use indirectness for politeness and nuance.
writeup: |-
  「のではないだろうか」 is a complex yet highly nuanced grammatical pattern in Japanese used to express one's opinion or conjecture indirectly, often in the form of a rhetorical question. It allows the speaker to propose an idea or belief gently, inviting the listener to consider it or agree, without making a definitive statement. This indirectness serves to convey modesty, politeness, or a desire to avoid confrontation.

  The construction literally means "Is it probably not the case that...?" and is composed of:
  *   「の」 (no): A nominalizer, transforming the preceding clause into a concept or a fact.
  *   「ではない」 (de wa nai): The negative form of the copula だ, meaning "is not."
  *   「だろう」 (darō): The plain presumptive auxiliary verb, indicating "probably" or "might."
  *   「か」 (ka): The interrogative particle.

  Common English translations include "I think... isn't it?", "It might be that...", or "Don't you agree?". The elongation and rhetorical nature of the phrase inherently soften the assertion, similar to how a speaker in English might say, "I wonder if it isn't the case that..." or "Wouldn't you say that...?"

  **Formation**:
  This pattern attaches to the plain form of verbs and い-adjectives. For な-adjectives and nouns, 「な」 must precede 「の」.
  *   Verbs (plain form) + 「のではないだろうか」
  *   い-Adjectives (plain form) + 「のではないだろうか」
  *   な-Adjectives (stem) + 「なのではないだろうか」
  *   Nouns + 「なのではないだろうか」

  **Variations**:
  The 「だろう」 part can be replaced with its polite equivalent, 「でしょう」, forming 「のではないでしょうか」. This makes the expression more formal and suitable for polite contexts, such as addressing superiors or strangers.

  **Usage Contexts**:
  *   **Indirect Opinion**: Expressing a personal thought or conclusion without sounding assertive.
  *   **Seeking Agreement**: Posing a question that subtly guides the listener towards the speaker's viewpoint.
  *   **Suggestion/Hypothesis**: Offering a possibility or theory in a gentle manner.

  This pattern is particularly common in discussions, debates, or any situation where one wishes to present an idea thoughtfully and collaboratively rather than dogmatically. Its indirectness is a hallmark of Japanese communication, emphasizing harmony and consideration for the listener.
false_friends:
  - term: でしょう
    meaning: Right? Probably, Isn't it?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「でしょう」 is a more direct and polite way to express conjecture or seek agreement compared to
      「のではないだろうか」. It asserts a higher degree of certainty or confidence in the speaker's assumption.
    grammar_point: だろう・でしょう (probably・right?)
  - term: だろう
    meaning: Right? Probably, Isn't it?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だろう」 is the plain, less formal version of 「でしょう」. While it also expresses conjecture, it
      lacks the indirectness and nuanced invitation for agreement found in 「のではないだろうか」. It's a more straightforward,
      often more casual, statement of probability.
    grammar_point: だろう・でしょう (probably・right?)
  - term: じゃないか
    meaning: Isn't it? Is it not?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「じゃないか」 is a more assertive and sometimes rhetorical expression, often used to confirm a shared
      understanding or to challenge a different viewpoint. It implies a stronger expectation of agreement
      or can even convey a slight sense of surprise or realization, unlike the softer, more inviting tone
      of 「のではないだろうか」.
    grammar_point: じゃないか (isn't it?)
  - term: に違いない
    meaning: There is no doubt that; I'm sure that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「のではないだろうか」 which is an indirect suggestion inviting agreement with an uncertain or
      tentative nuance, 「に違いない」 expresses strong conviction and certainty that something is definitely
      the case. It does not invite debate but states a firm conclusion.
    grammar_point: に違いない (no doubt)
  - term: はずだ
    meaning: Bound to be, Expected to be, Should be (able)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「はずだ」 indicates a logical expectation or certainty based on known facts or reasoning. While
      it expresses likelihood, it's more about logical consequence rather than an indirect, softer suggestion
      or query like 「のではないだろうか」.
    grammar_point: はずだ (is expected to be)
  - term: かもしれない
    meaning: Might, maybe, probably
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「かもしれない」 expresses a possibility or uncertainty, similar to the conjectural aspect of 「のではないだろうか」.
      However, 「かもしれない」 is a direct statement of possibility without the rhetorical question format or
      the implicit invitation for agreement that 「のではないだろうか」 carries. It's simply stating "it might be."
    grammar_point: かもしれない (might・maybe)
post_false_friends_writeup: While expressions like 「でしょう」, 「だろう」, and 「じゃないか」 also relate to conjecture
  or seeking agreement, and 「かもしれない」 expresses possibility, 「のではないだろうか」 offers a unique level of indirectness
  and politeness. In contrast, 「に違いない」 and 「はずだ」 convey a higher degree of certainty or logical expectation,
  differing from the gentle, inviting query of 「のではないだろうか」. Use 「のではないだろうか」 when you wish to present an
  opinion or suggestion humbly, subtly inviting consideration or agreement, especially in formal or sensitive
  contexts. The other expressions are more direct in their assertion or questioning.
examples:
  - english: I think he probably doesn't know anything about this matter, don't you agree?
    japanese:
      - 彼 は この 件 に つい て、何 も 知ら ない {の で は ない だろう か}。
      - 彼 は この 件 に つい て、何 も 知ら ない {の で は ない でしょう か}。
    english_literally: As for him, regarding this matter, he knows nothing, isn't it the case?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 何 も 知ら ない と {思う}。
        english: I think he knows nothing.
        hint: This is a direct statement of opinion, which might sound too strong or assertive in a workplace
          context. We're looking for a suggestion that invites agreement by implying it is not the case
          that he knows anything about this matter, inviting agreement that he probably doesn't know anything
          about this matter (which you agree is not the case that he knows anything).
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 何 も 知ら ない {だろう}。
        english: He probably knows nothing.
        hint: This is a casual conjecture, but it lacks the nuance of inviting agreement or subtle persuasion.
          We're looking for a more considerate way to express conjecture.
    scene: Two colleagues are discussing a project, and one is speculating about another colleague's involvement
      or knowledge, subtly inviting the other's agreement.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker uses 「のではないだろうか」 to express a tentative opinion about a colleague's knowledge,
      making it sound less accusatory and more like a shared observation. The use of the plain form verb
      「知らない」 before the grammar point is standard. The literal translation reveals the double negative
      of the Japanese that becomes a positive statement in English, expressing that it is not the case
      that he knows nothing, which means that he does indeed know nothing. The rhetorical question at
      the end means that you invite the other to agree with you about this fact. Therefore, it is literally,
      “Isn't it the case that he doesn't know anything?
  - english: Don't you think we won't make the deadline for this project?
    japanese:
      - この プロジェクト、締切り に 間に合わ ない {の で は ない でしょう か}。
      - この プロジェクト、締切り に 間に合わ ない {の で は ない だろう か}。
    english_literally: Regarding this project, will not meet the deadline, isn't it the case?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この プロジェクト、締切り に 間に合わ ない と {思う}。
        english: I think this project won't make the deadline.
        hint: This is too direct and pessimistic, potentially demoralizing for a junior member. We're
          looking for a softer way to express concern, by saying it isn't the case that we will meet the
          deadline, in a rhetorical question that seeks agreement that we won't meet the deadline.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この プロジェクト、締切り に 間に合わ ない {だろう}。
        english: This project probably won't make the deadline.
        hint: While conveying conjecture, this is less polite and might sound like a flat assertion rather
          than an invitation to discuss. We're looking for a more polite and indirect question.
    scene: A team leader is talking to a junior team member about a tight project schedule, gently hinting
      at a potential problem.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The speaker uses 「のではないでしょうか」 (the polite form) to gently suggest a potential problem (missing
      the deadline) to a team member, inviting their input or agreement without directly stating it as
      a fact. This approach fosters a collaborative problem-solving environment. The verb 「間に合わない」 (will
      not make it in time) is a plain negative verb, directly preceding the grammar point.
  - english: I wonder if the reason she's been a bit down lately is because she has some worries.
    japanese:
      - 最近、彼女 の 元気 が ない の は、何 か 悩み が ある {の で は ない だろう か}。
      - 最近、彼女 の 元気 が ない の は、何 か 悩み が ある {の で は ない でしょう か}。
    english_literally: Recently, her not having energy is, having some worries, isn't it the case?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 何 か 悩み が ある と {思う}。
        english: I think she has some worries.
        hint: This is a direct conclusion, potentially intrusive, especially when discussing a third party's
          personal feelings. We're looking for a gentle hypothesis, by saying it isn't the case that she
          does not have any worries, in a rhetorical question that seeks agreement that she has some worries.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 何 か 悩み が ある {だろう}。
        english: She probably has some worries.
        hint: This is less formal, and a direct conjecture without the inviting nuance. We're looking
          for a more empathetic way to speculate about someone's feelings.
    scene: Two friends are noticing a mutual friend's change in behavior and speculating about the cause,
      with one friend expressing a sensitive hypothesis.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker uses 「のではないだろうか」 to express a sensitive hypothesis about a friend's emotional
      state, making the observation feel gentle and empathetic rather than an intrusive judgment. The
      informal 「元気がない」 (not energetic/down) fits the casual register. The phrase 「悩みがある」 (has worries)
      precedes the grammar point, expressing the state of having worries.
  - english: Don't you think that new employee should probably study more honorifics?
    japanese:
      - あの 新入 社員 は、もう 少し 敬語 を 勉強 する べき {な の で は ない でしょう か}。
      - あの 新入 社員 は、もう 少し 敬語 を 勉強 する べき {な の で は ない だろう か}。
    english_literally: That new employee, should study honorifics a little more, isn't it the case?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 新入 社員 は、もう 少し 敬語 を 勉強 する {べき} だ。
        english: That new employee should study more honorifics.
        hint: This is a direct criticism, which might sound harsh or overly critical in a professional
          setting. We're looking for a more indirect and polite way to suggest improvement, by saying
          it isn't the case that he shouldn't study more honorifics, in a rhetorical question that seeks
          agreement that he should study more honorifics.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 新入 社員 は、もう 少し 敬語 を 勉強 する べき {だろう}。
        english: That new employee should probably study more honorifics.
        hint: While conveying conjecture, this is still quite direct for a criticism and less deferential
          than the polite form of the grammar point. We're looking for a more formal and indirect suggestion.
    scene: Two senior employees are discussing a new recruit's performance in a formal setting, giving
      indirect feedback.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: An older male speaker uses 「のではないでしょうか」 to politely suggest an area for improvement for a
      new employee. The use of 「敬語」 (honorifics) is a common point of discussion in Japanese business,
      and this phrasing allows for a gentle, indirect critique while maintaining a formal tone suitable
      for discussing colleagues. The phrase 「勉強するべき」 (should study) ends with a noun-like construction,
      requiring the 「な」 before 「の」 for the grammar point.
  - english: Perhaps, at that time, there might have been another option, don't you think?
    japanese:
      - もし か し たら、あの 時、別 の 選択 肢 が あっ た {の で は ない だろう か}。
      - もし か し たら、あの 時、別 の 選択 肢 が あっ た {の で は ない でしょう か}。
    english_literally: Perhaps, at that time, another option existed, isn't it the case?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 時、別 の 選択 肢 が あっ た と {思う}。
        english: I think there was another option at that time.
        hint: This is a more direct statement of regret or realization, lacking the nuance of pondering
          or deep self-reflection. We're looking for a more contemplative expression, by saying it isn't
          the case that there was no other option at that time, in a rhetorical question that seeks agreement
          that there was another option.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 時、別 の 選択 肢 が あっ た {だろう}。
        english: There was probably another option at that time.
        hint: While conjectural, this might sound too casual for a deep, reflective thought, suggesting
          a more superficial assumption. We're looking for a more nuanced and introspective expression.
    scene: Someone is reflecting on a past decision, perhaps after a negative outcome, pondering alternative
      paths.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The speaker uses 「のではないだろうか」 to express a tentative, retrospective thought about a past alternative,
      emphasizing an introspective and slightly regretful tone. The added 「もしかしたら」 (perhaps) further softens
      the speculation, highlighting uncertainty and contemplation. The plain past verb 「あった」 (existed)
      precedes the grammar point.
  - english: I think he's probably just a liar, don't you think?
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 単なる 嘘つき {な の で は ない だろう か}。
      - 彼 は 単なる 嘘つき {な の で は ない でしょう か}。
    english_literally: He is simply a liar, isn't it the case?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 単なる 嘘つき だ と {思う}。
        english: I think he's simply a liar.
        hint: This is a very blunt and direct accusation, which might sound overly aggressive or confrontational.
          We're looking for a softer way to express a strong suspicion, by saying it isn't the case that
          he is not a liar, in a rhetorical question that seeks agreement that he is a liar.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 単なる 嘘つき {だろう}。
        english: He's probably just a liar.
        hint: Still quite direct, even if a conjecture. The grammar point adds a layer of shared speculation,
          making the statement less personal and more like a shared observation. We're looking for a more
          inviting expression for agreement.
    scene: Two friends are discussing a dishonest acquaintance, and one is expressing a strong suspicion
      about their character.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker uses 「のではないだろうか」 to express a strong suspicion or negative opinion about someone's
      character (「嘘つき」 - liar) in a way that invites the listener to consider the idea or agree, making
      the statement less confrontational than a direct accusation. The casual 「単なる」 (simply) reinforces
      the tone, implying a straightforward conclusion reached by observation. As 「嘘つき」 is a noun, it takes
      「な」 before 「の」.
  - english: It seems like this exam was quite difficult, don't you think?
    japanese:
      - この 試験 は かなり 難しかっ た {の で は ない だろう か}。
      - この 試験 は かなり 難しかっ た {の で は ない でしょう か}。
    english_literally: This exam, was quite difficult, isn't it the case?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 試験 は かなり 難しかっ た {だろう}。
        english: This exam was probably quite difficult.
        hint: This is a direct conjecture. We're looking for a softer, more inviting expression of opinion,
          by saying it isn't the case that it wasn't difficult, in a rhetorical question that seeks agreement
          that it was difficult.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 試験 は かなり 難しかっ た と {思う}。
        english: I think this exam was quite difficult.
        hint: This is a direct statement of personal opinion. We're looking for a rhetorical question
          that seeks agreement.
    scene: Two students are leaving the exam hall, one of them exhausted.
    register: casual
    setting: academic
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The male speaker uses the plain form of the grammar point, 「のではないだろうか」, to share his impression
      of the exam's difficulty with a peer. The use of 「難しかった」 (was difficult), the past tense of an i-adjective,
      leads into the grammar point naturally. This casual tone is appropriate for conversation between
      classmates.
  - english: Don't you think that project was unnecessarily complicated?
    japanese:
      - あの プロジェクト は 必要 以上 に 複雑 {だっ た の で は ない でしょう か}。

    english_literally: That project, was unnecessarily complicated, isn't it the case?
    competing_grammar:

          - あの プロジェクト は 必要 以上 に 複雑 だっ た と {思う}。
        english: I think that project was unnecessarily complicated.
        hint: This is a direct expression of criticism. We're looking for a more tactful way to suggest
          an issue, by saying it isn't the case that it wasn't complicated, in a rhetorical question that
          seeks agreement that it was complicated.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの プロジェクト は 必要 以上 に 複雑 だっ た {じゃ ない か}。
        english: That project was unnecessarily complicated, wasn't it?!
        hint: This has a more assertive, almost confrontational tone. We're seeking a gentle, inviting
          query.
    scene: Senior managers are conducting a post-mortem meeting on a large-scale project.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The speaker uses the polite 「のではないでしょうか」 form to cautiously raise a point about the project's
      excessive complexity. The phrase 「必要以上に複雑」 (unnecessarily complicated) is attached to the past tense
      of the copula 「だった」, making it an observation about a past state. This formulation allows the speaker
      to present a critical observation in a constructive, non-confrontational manner, which is crucial
      in formal business settings. As 「複雑」 is a na-adjective, it requires the 「な」 before 「の」 when forming
      the plain form before the grammar point (e.g. 複雑だった).
  - english: I think it might be a misunderstanding, don't you agree?
    japanese:
      - それ は 誤解 {な の で は ない だろう か}。
      - それ は 誤解 {な の で は ない でしょう か}。
    english_literally: That is a misunderstanding, isn't it the case?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - それ は 誤解 だ と {思う}。
        english: I think that's a misunderstanding.
        hint: This is a direct statement, which might sound accusatory. We're looking for a gentle suggestion
          of a possibility, by saying it isn't the case that it isn't a misunderstanding, in a rhetorical
          question that seeks agreement that it is a misunderstanding.
      - competing_japanese:
          - それ は 誤解 {だろう}。
        english: While conjectural, this is more direct and less inviting of the listener's perspective.
          We're looking for a softer, shared inquiry.
        hint: While conjectural, this is more direct and less inviting of the listener's perspective.
          We're looking for a softer, shared inquiry.
    scene: Two friends are discussing a tense situation involving a third party, and one is offering a
      possible explanation.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The female speaker uses 「なのではないだろうか」 to softly suggest that the cause of tension is a 「誤解」
      (misunderstanding). The inclusion of 「な」 before 「の」 is essential for nouns like 誤解 when used with
      this grammar pattern. This phrasing allows for empathy and avoids sounding judgmental while proposing
      a solution.
  - english: Don't you think there's still a possibility that we can resolve this problem?
    japanese:
      - まだ この 問題 を 解決 できる {の で は ない だろう か}。
      - まだ この 問題 を 解決 できる {の で は ない でしょう か}。
    english_literally: Still this problem can be resolved, isn't it the case?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - まだ この 問題 を 解決 できる と {思う}。
        english: I think we can still resolve this problem.
        hint: This is a direct assertion of belief. We're looking for a more collaborative and encouraging
          question, by saying it isn't the case that we cannot resolve this problem, in a rhetorical question
          that seeks agreement that we can resolve this problem.
      - competing_japanese:
          - まだ この 問題 を 解決 できる {だろう}。
        english: We can probably still resolve this problem.
        hint: This is a direct conjecture. We're looking for an expression that seeks shared hope or confirmation.
    scene: A project team is facing a significant roadblock, and one team member tries to instill a sense
      of optimism and possibility.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: potential (～られる/～える)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The male speaker uses 「のではないでしょうか」 to express a hopeful possibility while seeking validation
      from the group. The verb 「解決できる」 (can resolve), which is a potential form, naturally precedes this
      construction. This phrasing is effective in a team setting to foster discussion and collective problem-solving
      rather than simply dictating a solution or expressing personal confidence.
post_example_writeup: While both 「だろう」 and 「でしょう」 convey conjecture, the choice between them is crucial
  for politeness. 「でしょう」 is the polite form and is generally appropriate for conversations with strangers
  or superiors. 「だろう」 is the plain form and is best reserved for casual conversation among close friends
  or family.
