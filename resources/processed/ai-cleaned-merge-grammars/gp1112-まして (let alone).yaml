    },
    "etymology": "The term 「まして」 comes from the verb 「増す (ます)」, meaning \"to increase\" or \"to add.\" The optional 「や」 particle adds emphasis, functioning to highlight a stronger degree or extent. Therefore, 「ましてや」 implies that something is even more so than what was previously stated, emphasizing the increased degree or certainty of the second statement.",
    "writeup": "「まして(や)」 is an adverb used to emphasize that if one thing is true, another is even more so. Conversely, it can also imply that if one thing is not true, another is even less likely to be true. This expression is frequently employed to highlight a contrast or a natural consequence, translating to phrases like \"let alone,\" \"not to mention,\" \"much less,\" or \"still more.\" The inclusion of the particle 「や」 is optional, but its presence significantly amplifies the sense of emphasis and the logical implication, making the connection between the two statements feel more undeniable.\n\nThis grammar point functions to establish a strong logical progression, where the second statement is presented as an even more extreme or evident outcome based on the first. It often appears in formal contexts, but its emphatic nature allows for usage in more casual speech when a strong point needs to be made. Its core utility lies in escalating a situation to an obvious conclusion, making it a powerful tool for argument or persuasion.",
