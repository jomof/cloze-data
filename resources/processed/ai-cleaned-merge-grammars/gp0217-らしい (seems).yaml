    "etymology": "The origin of 「らしい」 is not definitively known, but it's believed to be related to the verb 「等し(ひとし)」 (hitoshi), meaning \"equal\" or \"similar.\" Over time, 「等し」 evolved to express a sense of resemblance or approximation, eventually leading to the development of 「らしい」 as a way to convey that something appears to be a certain way based on available information.",
    "writeup": "「らしい」 is an auxiliary adjective used to express that something \"seems like,\" \"apparently is,\" or \"I heard that\" something is the case. It conveys that the speaker is making a judgment or assumption based on information they have received, but they are not entirely certain. It's similar to saying \"it seems that...\" or \"I heard that...\" in English.\n\nIt is essential to understand that 「らしい」 implies that the speaker has some reason to believe something is true, whether they heard it, saw it, or read it. However, there's still a degree of uncertainty involved. So, while it's a presumption, 「らしい」 often sounds relatively confident.\n\n「らしい」 attaches to the plain form of verbs, i-adjectives, and nouns without any particles.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Compared to 「そうだ」 and 「ようだ」:** While all three express presumption, 「らしい」 emphasizes information received from an external source, whereas 「そうだ」 often describes a direct observation or very direct hearsay. 「ようだ」 suggests a subjective judgment based on observation, implying a visible resemblance or similarity.\n*   **Other meaning:** Be aware that 「らしい」 also has another meaning, where it functions as an auxiliary adjective describing something as \"typical of\" or \"becoming of\" something else (e.g., 「男らしい」 - manly). This grammar point focuses solely on the conjectural meaning. The other meaning will be covered in a separate lesson.",
