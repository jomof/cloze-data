    "writeup": "The grammar point 「なし」, written as 無し in kanji, functions primarily as a suffix, though it originates from the noun meaning 「ないこと」, \"thing without\". It's used to indicate the absence of something. 「なし」is often used with the auxiliary verb 「だ」or its conjunctive form 「で」. For example, 「なしで」 means \"without (something)\". When connecting directly to another noun, 「の」 is required, forming a phrase like 「なしの」, meaning \"(A) that is without (B)\".  It can also refer to skipping or avoiding something, often paired with 「に」 to show determination.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「なし」is distinct from 「抜き」, which also means \"without (A)\". 「抜き」implies the intentional removal of something, derived from the verb 「抜く」 \"to remove\". While sometimes interchangeable, 「抜き」carries a nuance of active removal, while 「なし」simply indicates absence.",
    "etymology": "「なし」 comes from the noun 「無(な)い」 (nai) which means 'nothing' or 'not existing.' It's related to the verb 「無(な)くなる」 (nakunaru) meaning 'to disappear' or 'to be lost.'",
