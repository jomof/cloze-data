    "etymology": "「なし」 comes from the noun 「無(な)い」 (nai) which means 'nothing' or 'not existing.' It's related to the verb 「無(な)くなる」 (nakunaru) meaning 'to disappear' or 'to be lost.'",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「なし」, written as 無し in kanji, functions primarily as a suffix, though it originates from the noun meaning 「ないこと」, \"thing without\". It's used to indicate the absence of something. 「なし」 is often used with the auxiliary verb 「だ」 or its conjunctive form 「で」. For example, 「なしで」 means \"without (something)\". When connecting directly to another noun, 「の」 is required, forming a phrase like 「なしの」, meaning \"(A) that is without (B)\". It can also refer to skipping or avoiding something, often paired with 「に」 to show determination.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「なし」 is distinct from 「抜き」, which also means \"without (A)\". 「抜き」 implies the intentional removal of something, derived from the verb 「抜く」 \"to remove\". While sometimes interchangeable, 「抜き」 carries a nuance of active removal, while 「なし」 simply indicates absence.",

            "term": "抜きで",
            "meaning": "Without, unless",
            "kind": "often confused with",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「なし」, 「抜きで」 implies the active removal or omission of something. Use 「抜きで」 when you want to emphasize that something was intentionally left out."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「なし」 and 「抜きで」 can translate to \"without,\" remember that 「抜きで」 has a connotation of intentional removal. If you're simply stating the absence of something, 「なし」 is more appropriate. If you're highlighting that something was deliberately excluded, choose 「抜きで」.",
