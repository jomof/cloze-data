formation:
  Verb[て] + みせる: Expresses the speaker's strong determination to do something, often to show someone else.
jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  usage-context: General usage
  function: Used to express the speaker's strong determination to do something, often with the intention
    of demonstrating the result to others.
  nuance: Implies a demonstration of skill, resolve, or the fulfillment of a promise to an audience, whether
    directly present or implicitly addressed. It goes beyond a mere statement of intent.
  colocation: Often follows verbs indicating effort, achievement, or action, such as やり遂げる (to accomplish)・合格する
    (to pass)・応える (to meet expectations)・成功させる (to make successful)・走る (to run)・作る (to make)・乗り越える (to
    overcome).
  grammatical-role: Functions as an auxiliary verb, attaching to the te-form of a preceding verb to add
    nuance of demonstrative determination.
etymology: 「みせる」 (miseru) as an auxiliary verb traces its origin to the verb 「見る」 (miru・to see) or 「見せる」
  (miseru・to show). When appended in the 「て」 (te) form, it signifies the speaker's resolve to perform
  an action to such an extent that the result becomes apparent to others. This emphasizes the speaker's
  determination and confidence, akin to saying "I will do it and show you the outcome," thereby implying
  a strong promise or boast.
writeup: The grammar point 「Verb[て]+みせる」 expresses the speaker's strong determination to do something,
  often with the intention of demonstrating the result to others. It carries a nuance of confidence and
  resolve, suggesting that the speaker wants to prove something or fulfill a promise. To form it, simply
  conjugate the verb into its て-form and then add 「みせる」. The level of emphasis can vary based on context;
  it can range from a simple declaration of intent to a strong, almost boastful, promise. This pattern
  inherently implies an audience, whether directly present or implicitly addressed. If the person being
  shown is not explicitly stated, it often implies a general audience, such as "I'll show everyone." It
  is not merely a strong statement of intent, but rather a commitment to achieve something in a way that
  its success will be evident to others. This emphasis on 'showing' distinguishes it from simpler declarations
  of intent.
false_friends:
  - term: 見せる (literal verb)
    meaning: To show, to let someone see
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「見せる」 as a standalone verb literally means "to show" or "to display." In 「Verb[て]+みせる」, it
      functions as an auxiliary verb, adding a strong nuance of determination and a promise to demonstrate
      the result of the action, going beyond mere display.
    grammar_point: '<suggest>: 見せる (literal verb)'
  - term: Verb[volitional-よう]+思う
    meaning: I think I will; I'm thinking of; I intend to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「Verb[volitional-よう]+思う」 expresses a personal intention or decision. It lacks the strong sense
      of showing or proving something to others that 「Verb[て]+みせる」 carries. There's no inherent implication
      of an audience or a demonstrative outcome.
    grammar_point: Verb[volitional-よう]+思う (intend to or think I will)
  - term: つもりだ
    meaning: To plan to, to intend to; to think that, to believe that.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「つもりだ」 states one's intention or belief. While it conveys personal resolve, it does not carry
      the connotation of demonstrating or proving something to others, which is central to the meaning
      of 「Verb[て]+みせる」.
    grammar_point: つもりだ (intention or conviction)
  - term: Verb[て]+やる (strong personal resolve)
    meaning: To do (with strong, often personal or slightly aggressive resolve)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「Verb[て]+やる」 can also express strong determination, it often carries a more personal,
      sometimes defiant, or even slightly aggressive nuance, without the explicit intention of 'showing'
      or 'proving' to an audience as strongly as 「Verb[て]+みせる」. It's more about "I'll do it, for my own
      sake or to spite you."
    grammar_point: '<suggest>: Verb[て]+やる (strong personal resolve)'
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「Verb[て]+みせる」・「Verb[volitional-よう]+思う」・「つもりだ」・and 「Verb[て]+やる」 all involve
  some degree of intention or resolve, it's crucial to distinguish their nuances. 「Verb[て]+みせる」 uniquely
  emphasizes the act of demonstrating the outcome to an audience, implicitly or explicitly, often as a
  show of capability or fulfillment of a challenge. In contrast, 「Verb[volitional-よう]+思う」 and 「つもりだ」 are
  primarily about personal internal plans or convictions. 「Verb[て]+やる」, while indicating strong resolve,
  often carries a more self-directed or even defiant tone, rather than one of proving something to others.

post_example_writeup: The examples showcase the versatility of 「Verb[て]+みせる」 across various contexts,
  from professional commitments and personal resolves to inspirational declarations. Notice how it consistently
  emphasizes a demonstration of the action's outcome, often with an underlying intent to prove something
  to oneself or others. This is a key distinction from simple statements of intent. The choice between
  plain and polite forms, and gendered speech, further refines the nuance, reflecting the speaker's relationship
  with the listener and the formality of the situation.
