Often used with the particle 「が」 to indicate the subject being understood. Unlike 知る (shiru), which means 'to know' a fact, 分かる emphasizes comprehension of meaning or details.

Over time, 「分ける」 evolved to imply the ability to discern and comprehend, leading to the development of 「分かる」 as a verb for understanding.",
    "writeup": "The verb 「分かる (wakaru)」 means \"to understand,\" \"to comprehend,\" or \"to know.\" It describes a state of knowing or understanding rather than the action of learning. It is an intransitive verb, meaning it does not take a direct object. It is often used with the particle 「が」 to indicate the subject that is understood. The person who understands usually takes the particle 「に」 or 「は」. In the negative form, 「分からない (wakaranai)」, it expresses not understanding or not knowing. The polite forms are 「分かります (wakarimasu)」 and 「分かりません (wakarisemasen)」.It is **important** to note the difference between 「分かる」 and 「知る (shiru)」. 「知る」 means \"to know\" in the sense of being aware of something, while 「分かる」 means \"to understand\" or \"comprehend\" the meaning or details of something. While 「理解する (rikai suru)」 also means \"to comprehend,\" 「分かる」 often conveys a more spontaneous or natural understanding, whereas 「理解する」 suggests a more deliberate or intellectual effort to grasp a concept.",
