  part-of-speech: verb
  register: casual
  function: Denotes the state of comprehending, discerning, or being able to perceive. It often implies
    an internal realization or insight.
  nuance: 「分かる」 describes the state of something becoming clear to one's mind or senses. It's often passive
    in nature, implying that the understanding 'comes to' the person. This contrasts with active acquisition
    of knowledge. It can also mean 'to be understood' or 'to be intelligible'.
etymology: The verb 「分かる」 (wakaru) originally comes from 「分く」 (waku), meaning 'to divide' or 'to separate.'
  From this root, it evolved to mean 'to distinguish' or 'to discern,' leading to its current meaning
  of 'to understand' or 'to comprehend.' This etymology highlights the idea of separating out, or distinguishing,
  different elements to gain clarity and grasp the whole. It's not about actively putting knowledge into
  your head, but rather about things becoming clear or distinguishable on their own.
writeup: |-
  「分かる」 (wakaru) is a fundamental verb in Japanese that signifies 'to understand,' 'to know,' or 'to comprehend.' Unlike actively acquiring knowledge or being familiar with something, 「分かる」 often implies a state where something becomes clear or intelligible to you. It's less about the effort you put into learning and more about the result of information sinking in or being perceived.

  This verb is typically used with the particle 「が」 to mark the thing that is understood or known. For example, 「日本語が分かります」 (Nihongo ga wakarimasu) means 'I understand Japanese.' This construction emphasizes that Japanese 'is understandable' to you.

  It can also be used in more nuanced ways:
  *   **Perception or Discernment**: It can refer to discerning something through sensory perception or logical deduction, such as 「音が分かる」 (Oto ga wakaru - 'I can hear/understand the sound') or 「意味が分かる」 (Imi ga wakaru - 'I understand the meaning').
  *   **Discovery or Realization**: 「分かった！」 (Wakatta!) is a common exclamation meaning 'I got it!' or 'I understand now!' indicating a sudden realization.
  *   **Intelligibility**: It can describe whether something itself is comprehensible to others, as in 「私の話は分かりますか」 (Watashi no hanashi wa wakarimasu ka - 'Is my story understandable?').

  When expressing that *you* understand something, it's common to use 「私には分かります」 (watashi ni wa wakarimasu). The particle 「には」 can add a nuance of 'as far as I am concerned' or 'for me,' often implying a personal understanding or even a subtle distinction from others' understanding.

  「分かる」 is an intransitive verb, meaning it does not take a direct object marked by 「を」. Instead, the thing understood is marked by 「が」. This is a key point to remember for its usage.

  - term: 知る
    meaning: to know, to be aware of
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「知る」 implies having acquired information or being acquainted with facts. It's about having
      knowledge or awareness. In contrast, 「分かる」 implies comprehension, discernment, or a state of understanding.
      You might 「知る」 (know) a fact, but not necessarily 「分かる」 (understand) its implications.
    grammar_point: 知る (to know or find out)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'While both 「分かる」 and 「知る」 relate to knowledge, their fundamental difference
  lies in their focus. 「知る」 is about possessing information or being acquainted with something—it''s about
  "knowing *of*." For instance, 「私は彼の名前を{知っています}」 (Watashi wa kare no namae o shitte imasu - "I know his
  name") means you possess the information of his name. On the other hand, 「分かる」 is about processing and
  comprehending that information—it''s about "understanding." 「彼の言っていることが{分かる}」 (Kare no itte iru koto
  ga wakaru - "I understand what he''s saying") implies not just hearing the words, but grasping their
  meaning. Think of it this way: you can 「知る」 (know) that a certain math formula exists, but you need
  to 「分かる」 (understand) how to apply it.'
