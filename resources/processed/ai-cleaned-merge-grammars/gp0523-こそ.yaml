        "grammatical-role": "Functions as an adverbial particle that intensifies the word or clause it follows."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「こそ」 evolved from the archaic adverb 「強し (こわし)」, meaning 'strong' or 'intense.' Over time, its use broadened from simply indicating intensity to highlighting specific elements within a sentence as being particularly significant or decisive. This transition reflects its role in linguistic evolution as a marker of strong emphasis.",
    "writeup": "「こそ」 is an adverbial particle in Japanese used to intensely emphasize the preceding noun, verb (in て-form or plain form), or clause. Its primary function is to draw strong attention to the element it follows, suggesting it is *the* precise, definite, or most crucial piece of information in the context. This can be likened to bolding or underlining text in English for emphasis.\n\nWhen 「こそ」 follows a noun, it often replaces the particles 「を」 or 「が」. This is because 「こそ」 takes on the role of marking the emphasized noun, making the explicit subject or object particles redundant. For instance, while 「が」 points to specific information, 「こそ」 elevates that specificity to a decisive declaration.\n\n**Common Applications:**\n*   **Strong Assertion:** Used to declare something with conviction, such as \"This is *the* one!\" or \"*Now* is the time!\"\n*   **Mutual Obligation/Humility:** Often seen in polite exchanges, like 「こちらこそ」 (literally, \"It is I who should be...\"), to express that the speaker feels equally or more indebted/grateful than the other person. This is a common way to respond to thanks or apologies.\n*   **Conditional/Causal Emphasis:** When following the て-form of a verb (～てこそ) or a plain form clause (～からこそ), it emphasizes a prerequisite or a precise reason, indicating that something is true *only when* or *precisely because* of the preceding condition or reason.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「こそ」 functions differently from 「は」 and 「が」. While 「は」 marks a general topic and 「が」 identifies specific subjects/objects, 「こそ」 *decisively* highlights the preceding element, often in contrast to other possibilities.\n*   It conveys a sense of finality or strong determination, making the statement more impactful.",
