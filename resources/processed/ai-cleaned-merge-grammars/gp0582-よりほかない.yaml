    "writeup": "「よりほかない」 is used when there is no other choice or option. It is a formal expression similar to 「しかない」, emphasizing that only one course of action is possible. It’s a combination of 「より」 (than), 「ほか」 (other), and 「ない」 (not), literally meaning \"there is nothing other than.\" Common interpretations include \"to have no choice but to (A)\", \"there is no other way than (A)\", or simply \"have to (A)\".\n\nOccasionally, the particles 「に」, 「は」, or a combination of both as 「には」 may come between 「他」 and 「ない」. While this does not change the meaning, it does further emphasize the point that there is no choice but (A). This grammatical pattern is primarily used in formal or somewhat rigid contexts, conveying a strong sense of inevitability.",
