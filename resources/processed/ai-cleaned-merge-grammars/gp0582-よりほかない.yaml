    "etymology": "The grammar point 「よりほかない」is derived from 「より」 (than), 「他」 (hoka, other), and 「ない」 (nai, not). Literally, it means \"there is nothing other than (A),\" emphasizing the impossibility of any alternative.",
    "writeup": "「よりほかない」is used to express that there is no other choice or option but to do something. It's similar to 「しかない」but conveys a stronger sense of inevitability or lack of alternatives. The structure emphasizes that only one course of action is possible in a given situation. It is a formal expression.",
