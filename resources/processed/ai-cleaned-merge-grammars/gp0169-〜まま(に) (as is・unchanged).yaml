details:
  part-of-speech: noun
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: general
  function: Expresses a state or condition that continues without change, or an action performed while
    a previous state is maintained.
  nuance: Implies that a certain state is being maintained, often with a nuance of either acceptance,
    neglect, or continuation of a previous action. The 'unchanged' state can be viewed neutrally or negatively,
    depending on context. The particle 「に」 can be added for emphasis on the following verb or to specify
    the state more clearly.
etymology: The term 「まま」 originates from the kanji 「儘」, meaning "as it is" or "in its natural state."
  This core concept reflects its use in describing situations where a state or condition persists without
  alteration. Its evolution signifies a continuity or inaction, allowing for the expression of both neutral
  observation and, at times, a nuanced sense of neglect or acceptance of an unchanging situation.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point **〜まま(に)** indicates that a certain state or action continues without alteration. It is used to express that something remains "as is" or that an action is performed while maintaining a previous condition. This can convey a sense of **acceptance**, **neglect**, or simply the **continuation** of a state. For instance, in 「ドア を 開けた まま」, it implies the door remains open. This construction connects two actions or states, where the second occurs while the first is maintained.

  **まま** can be used neutrally, but it often carries a nuance, particularly when describing situations that *should* have been changed but were not, implying **carelessness** or **negligence**. It is widely used across various registers, from casual conversation to more formal writing, depending on the context and the preceding word.

  While **まま** is a noun and can stand alone, it can also be followed by the case-marking particle **に**. The presence of **に** places extra emphasis on the following verb in the sentence, clearly indicating the manner or state in which the action is performed. For example, 「そのままにする」 (to leave it as it is) implies keeping it in that state.

  In casual speech or writing, **まま** can sometimes be pronounced and written as **まんま**, especially to convey a more conversational tone.

  - term: とおり
    meaning: As; in accordance with
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「まま(に)」, 「とおり」 indicates following a specific instruction or standard, rather than
      maintaining a state. 「まま(に)」 is about something being left unchanged, whereas 「とおり」 is about following
      a model.
    grammar_point: とおり (exactly as)
  - term: 〜っぱなし
    meaning: Leaving something in a certain state; left as is; continuing to do something without interruption
      (often implying negligence or an undesirable outcome)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「まま(に)」, 「〜っぱなし」 often carries a stronger negative connotation, implying neglect, carelessness,
      or leaving something unattended.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]っぱなし (leaving something in a state)'
  - term: てある
    meaning: Something is done, has been done, remaining state
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「まま(に)」, 「てある」 describes a state resulting from a deliberate action and often implies
      purpose or preparation. 「まま(に)」 focuses on the mere continuation of a state.
    grammar_point: てある (resultant state)
  - term: きり
    meaning: Only, just, since
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「きり」 indicates a limit or boundary, suggesting that an action or state has continued *only*
      up to a certain point or that *only* one thing has happened. 「まま(に)」 describes an ongoing or unchanged
      state without emphasizing limitation.
    grammar_point: 〜きり (only・just)
  - term: たなり・なり
    meaning: While... ~ing, Remaining, Not or ever since, Keep or leave
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たなり・なり」 is often a more literary or slightly archaic expression with a wider range of meanings
      including 'as soon as' or 'ever since'. While it can describe a remaining state, 「まま(に)」 more specifically
      refers to the simple continuation of a state.
    grammar_point: たなり・なり (ever since・remaining)
  - term: Verb[れる・られる]~ままに
    meaning: Do as (one is told or ordered…), In accordance with, In compliance with, Just like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「れる・られる+ままに」 indicates obedience or compliance with someone's instructions or circumstances.
      In contrast, plain 「まま(に)」 refers to an existing, unaltered state of something, not an action taken
      in accordance with something else.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-(ら)れる]ままに (as one is told)'
  - term: 如く・如き・如し
    meaning: Like, Similar to, As if, The same as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「如く・如き・如し」 describes similarity or resemblance, drawing a comparison between two things. 「まま(に)」
      indicates the literal continuation of a state or condition, without drawing a comparison.
    grammar_point: 〜如し・〜ごとし (like・as if)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing 「まま(に)」 with these similar expressions, remember that 「まま(に)」
  focuses on an unchanged condition or state. The other expressions introduce nuances such as intentional
  action, negligence, limitation, comparison, or compliance. Pay attention to the context to determine
  the appropriate expression.
