id: gp0098
meaning: No one; nobody (when used with a negative verb)
pronunciation:
  katakana: ダレモ
  romaji: daremo
formation:
  誰 (who) + も (particle) + [Negative Verb or Adjective]: Indicates that no one or nobody performs an action
    or possesses a characteristic.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The phrase 誰も is a combination of 誰 (dare), meaning "who," and the particle も (mo). The particle
  も, when paired with an interrogative word and followed by a negative predicate, creates a comprehensive
  negation. This structure literally translates to "not even a who," thereby conveying the meaning of
  "no one" or "nobody." This pattern is also seen in similar constructions like 何も (nothing) and どこも (nowhere),
  indicating a complete absence or negation.
writeup: |-
  The phrase 誰も is used to indicate "no one" or "nobody" in Japanese. It is always followed by a negative form of a verb or adjective. The particle も in this context serves to emphasize the complete lack or absence of someone. This construction signifies a total negation regarding people.

  It is crucial to remember that 誰も **must** be paired with a negative predicate. If used with a positive predicate (e.g., 誰でも or 誰もが), its meaning changes significantly, often implying "everyone" or "anyone." Understanding this distinction is fundamental.

  This grammatical pattern is essential for expressing comprehensive negation in Japanese, extending beyond people to include things (何も - nothing) and places (どこも - nowhere). Mastering the role of も with interrogatives in negative sentences is key to correctly interpreting and using these expressions.
false_friends:
  - term: 誰でも
    meaning: Anyone; everyone
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 誰も (no one), 誰でも refers to "anyone" or "everyone" and is used with a positive predicate.
      It implies inclusivity or universality, a direct opposite of 誰も's negative implication.
    grammar_point: 誰でも (anyone・everyone)
  - term: 何も
    meaning: Nothing (when used with a negative verb)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While similar in structure (interrogative + も + negative), 何も refers to "nothing" (things),
      whereas 誰も refers to "no one" (people). Both require a negative predicate.
    grammar_point: なにか・なにも (something or nothing)
  - term: どこも
    meaning: Nowhere (when used with a negative verb); Everywhere (with positive verb)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 誰も, どこも uses the interrogative どこ (where) with も to indicate "nowhere" when followed
      by a negative predicate. With a positive verb, it can mean "everywhere." The key is the accompanying
      verb's polarity.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:どこも (nowhere・everywhere)
  - term: 誰もが
    meaning: Everyone; everybody
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This phrase explicitly means "everyone" and is typically followed by a positive verb. It emphasizes
      that a characteristic or action applies to all individuals, contrasting sharply with 誰も which implies
      negation.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:誰もが (everyone)
  - term: 誰も彼も
    meaning: Everyone; every single person
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: An idiomatic expression that strongly emphasizes "everyone" or "every single person," often
      used when referring to a large, inclusive group. It is always used with a positive predicate, unlike
      誰も.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:誰も彼も (everyone・every single person)
post_false_friends_writeup: It is common for learners to confuse 誰も with phrases like 誰でも or 誰もが because
  they all involve 誰 (who). The key distinction lies in the particle that follows 誰 and whether the predicate
  is positive or negative. 誰も, when meaning "no one," *always* takes a negative verb. In contrast, 誰でも
  and 誰もが are generally used with positive verbs to mean "anyone" or "everyone." Pay close attention to
  the verb conjugation to correctly interpret these expressions and avoid mixing them up.
