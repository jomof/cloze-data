    "etymology": "The grammar point 「を巡って」 comes from the verb 「巡る(めぐる)」, which means \"to go around, to surround.\" The 「を」 particle indicates the object being circulated or discussed. Therefore, 「を巡って」 literally means \"going around \\[something]\", and is used to express that something is being discussed, debated, or contested.",
    "writeup": "「を巡って」 is a formal expression. It is formed by combining a noun with the case marking particle を and the う-verb 巡る (to go around) in its て-form (巡って) or plain form (巡る). This grammar point is used to indicate that something is \"concerning\", \"regarding\", or \"about\" a particular topic, issue, or point of contention. It implies that there are multiple viewpoints or discussions surrounding the subject, carrying the nuance of \"going around the topic of.\" This suggests a comprehensive consideration or potential disagreement. Consequently, 「を巡って」 is frequently used when there is a disagreement or dispute about a matter, taking into consideration many different viewpoints. It is typically reserved for formal contexts and written materials. It can sound unnatural if the topic is merely a personal opinion without contention.",
