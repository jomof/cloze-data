    "etymology": "The grammar point 「を巡って」 comes from the verb 「巡る (めぐる)」, which means \"to go around, to surround.\" The 「を」 particle indicates the object being circulated or discussed. Therefore, 「を巡って」 literally means \"going around [something]\", and is used to express that something is being discussed, debated, or contested from various angles or perspectives.",
    "writeup": "「を巡って」 is a formal expression that combines a noun with the case marking particle を and the う-verb 巡る (to go around) in its て-form (巡って) or plain form (巡る). This grammar point is used to indicate that something is \"concerning,\" \"regarding,\" or \"about\" a particular topic, issue, or point of contention. It strongly implies that there are multiple viewpoints or discussions surrounding the subject, carrying the nuance of \"going around the topic of\" or \"encompassing\" the issue from various angles. This suggests a comprehensive consideration or, more often, a situation involving disagreement or dispute. Consequently, 「を巡って」 is frequently employed when there is a significant disagreement or active debate about a matter, where various perspectives are being considered or contended. It is typically reserved for formal contexts and written materials. Using 「を巡って」 when the topic is merely a personal opinion without contention can sound unnatural due to its inherent implication of broader discussion or dispute.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「を巡って」, 「に関する/に関して」 does not necessarily imply a debate or dispute; it simply indicates a relationship or relevance to a topic. It is a more neutral term."

            "term": "について",
            "meaning": "About, concerning",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「について」 is a general particle used to express 'about' or 'concerning' a topic. It is less formal and does not carry the strong connotation of disagreement or multiple viewpoints that 「を巡って」 does. It can be used for any general topic of discussion."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「に関する」, 「に関して」, and 「について」 can all be translated as \"regarding\" or \"concerning,\" 「を巡って」 carries a much stronger connotation of discussion, debate, or contention. Use 「に関する」 or 「に関して」 when you simply want to indicate a connection or relevance to a topic, and 「について」 for general discussions. Reserve 「を巡って」 for situations where there are differing opinions, disputes, or active, often intense, discussions surrounding a particular issue.",
