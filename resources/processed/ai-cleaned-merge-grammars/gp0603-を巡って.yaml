    "etymology": "The grammar point 「を巡って」 comes from the verb 「巡る(めぐる)」, which means \"to go around, to surround.\" The 「を」 particle indicates the object being circulated or discussed. Therefore, 「を巡って」 literally means \"going around \\[something]\", and is used to express that something is being discussed, debated, or contested.",
    "writeup": "「を巡って」 is a formal expression used to indicate that something is \"concerning\", \"regarding\", or \"about\" a particular topic, issue, or point of contention. It implies that there are multiple viewpoints or discussions surrounding the subject. It carries a nuance of \"going around the topic of,\" suggesting comprehensive consideration or potential disagreement. Use of this grammar point is typically reserved for formal contexts and written materials. It is best used when there is genuine debate or disagreement, and can seem unnatural when discussing personal opinions.",
