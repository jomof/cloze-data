    "etymology": "The etymology of 「ほとんど」 is not definitively known, but it is believed to have originated from the verb 「程取る (hodotoru)」, meaning to 'take a degree' or 'measure'. Over time, this evolved to imply 'almost reaching the full extent' or 'degree'.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「ほとんど」 is versatile, translating to \"almost all,\" \"most,\" \"hardly any,\" or similar expressions, depending on the context. Think of it as \"almost,\" referring to a complete group rather than a single item. Like other adverbs of quantity, 「ほとんど」 can modify a whole phrase or precede 「の」 to specify a noun. In negative sentences, 「ほとんど」 means \"hardly any,\" emphasizing that the 'full group' it describes is almost nonexistent. It is generally written in kana, though the kanji form 「殆ど」 can also be seen.",

The nuance shifts based on the presence of negation, making it a powerful tool for expressing quantity across a wide spectrum. Pay close attention to whether the sentence is affirmative or negative to correctly interpret its meaning.",
