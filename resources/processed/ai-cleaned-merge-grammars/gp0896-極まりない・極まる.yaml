    "etymology": "The grammar point 「極まりない・極まる」 comes from the verb 「極まる (kiwamaru)」, meaning \"to reach an extreme.\" 「極まり (kiwamari)」 is the noun form of 「極まる」, and 「ない (nai)」 is the negative adjective. So, 「極まりない」 literally means \"there is no end to the extreme.\"",
    "writeup": "This grammar structure, seen as either 「極まりない」 or 「極まる」, utilizes the core meaning of the verb 「極まる」, \"to be at the extremity of (A),\" and is often translated as \"extremely (A).\" It typically follows words indicating a negative state or emotion. \n\n「極まる」 will be used immediately following な-Adjectives, while 「極まりない」 will come after 「こと」 when either a な-Adjective or い-Adjective precedes it. In the case of な-Adjectives, it is not a requirement that 「極まりない」 be preceded by 「なこと」, and it is actually more common for it to directly follow the な-Adjective without 「な」.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n「極まりない」 is **not** the negative form of 「極まる」. Rather, 「極まり」 (the extremity) is followed by the い-adjective 「ない」, with 「が」 omitted between them. A literal translation would be:\n\n*   失礼極まりない - There is no limit to the rudeness.\n*   失礼極まる - The rudeness goes to the limit.\n\nThe true negative form of 「極まる」 is 「極まらない」, meaning something does \"not go to the limit of (A).\"",
