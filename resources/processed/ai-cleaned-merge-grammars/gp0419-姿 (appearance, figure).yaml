    "etymology": "The word 「姿 (sugata)」 originally meant 'shape' or 'form.' Over time, it evolved to include the broader sense of outward appearance, including what someone is wearing or how they are acting. It carries a nuance of how someone presents themselves to the world, often highlighting the aesthetic or emotional impact of their presence. Its evolution from a concrete 'shape' to a more abstract 'appearance' reflects how observation is intertwined with perception in Japanese.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Noun+の・Verb[dictionary]・Adjective+姿」 is used as a suffix to describe someone's outward appearance or figure. It highlights how a person, or occasionally an animal, appears to an observer, emphasizing their physical form, what they are wearing, or their manner while performing an action. This expression captures the **visual impression** or **specific presence** created by the subject.\n\nWhen attached to a noun, it typically requires the particle の (e.g., 子供 の 姿 - a child's figure). However, for kanji compounds, の can sometimes be omitted (e.g., 花嫁姿 - bridal figure).\n\nWhen attached to a verb, the verb must be in its dictionary form (e.g., 走る 姿 - a running figure) or progressive ている form (e.g., 働いている 姿 - a working figure).\n\nWhen attached to an adjective, the adjective maintains its dictionary form (e.g., 美しい 姿 - a beautiful figure).\n\n「姿」 is not merely a description of facts; it often conveys the observer's impression or feeling about the subject's appearance or presence. It highlights the aesthetic or emotional impact of what is seen, making it a powerful tool for conveying nuance in visual descriptions. It can be used in a wide variety of contexts and registers.",
