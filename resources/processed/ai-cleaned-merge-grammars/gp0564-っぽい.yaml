    "etymology": "The suffix 「っぽい」 is derived from the verb 「〜う」, which means 'to seem like, to appear'. Over time, 「〜う」 evolved into 「〜い」, and combined with 「〜ほう」 (side, direction) to create 「〜ほうい」, eventually shortening to 「〜ぽい」. This suffix adds the nuance of something resembling or tending towards a particular quality or characteristic.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「っぽい」 (sometimes seen as 「ぽい」) attaches to nouns, adjective stems, and verb stems to create *i*-adjectives. It means \"-ish,\" \"-like,\" \"characteristic of,\" or \"tendency to.\" It often carries a negative connotation, implying something is not quite genuine or excessive. For example, something 「安っぽい」 looks cheap, or someone who is 「忘れっぽい」 is forgetful.",
