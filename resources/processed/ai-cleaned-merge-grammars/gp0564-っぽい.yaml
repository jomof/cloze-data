    "etymology": "The origin of 「っぽい」 is debated. One theory suggests it is a combination of 「方 (hō)」 meaning 'direction' or 'side', and the い adjective suffix 「い」, evolving to indicate a tendency towards something. Another theory posits a connection to 「埃 (hokori)」, meaning 'dust' or 'dirt', implying a superficial resemblance.",
    "writeup": "「っぽい」 (sometimes written as 「ぽい」) is a suffix that creates い-adjectives. It indicates something exhibits characteristics of something else. It can be translated as \"-ish,\" \"-like,\" or \"tendency to.\" It often carries a negative connotation, implying that something only *appears* to be something else, or has an undesirable tendency.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n*   **Noun + っぽい**: Shows signs of being something, but is not quite it. For example, 「子供っぽい」 (kodomo-ppoi) means \"childish\" or \"child-like.\"\n*   **Verb stem + っぽい**: Indicates a tendency to do something. For example, 「忘れっぽい」 (wasure-ppoi) means \"forgetful\" or \"having a tendency to forget.\"\n*   **Adjective stem + っぽい**: Exhibits the signs of being the adjective. 「安っぽい」 (yasu-ppoi) means \"cheapish\" or \"looking cheap.\"\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\nThe negative connotation arises because 「っぽい」 often implies something is superficial or excessive. The speaker feels something is in excess of what is expected.",
