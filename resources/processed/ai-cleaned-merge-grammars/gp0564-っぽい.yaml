    "etymology": "The suffix 「っぽい」 is derived from the verb 「〜う」, which means 'to seem like, to appear'. Over time, 「〜う」 evolved into 「〜い」, and combined with 「〜ほう」 (side, direction) to create 「〜ほうい」, eventually shortening to 「〜ぽい」. This suffix adds the nuance of something resembling or tending towards a particular quality or characteristic.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「っぽい」 (sometimes seen as 「ぽい」) attaches to nouns, adjective stems, and verb stems to create *i*-adjectives. It means \"-ish,\" \"-like,\" \"characteristic of,\" or \"tendency to.\" It often carries a negative connotation, implying something is not quite genuine or excessive. For example, something 「安っぽい」 looks cheap, or someone who is 「忘れっぽい」 is forgetful. As 「っぽい」 creates new *i*-adjectives, it may be used with the conjunctive form of verbs, or the stem form of any other word. 「っぽい」 itself may be conjugated in exactly the same way as regular *i*-adjectives. The fundamental meaning of 「っぽい」 changes depending on what type of word it is being used with: Verb + っぽい: To have a tendency to do (A). Adjective + っぽい: To exhibit all the signs of being (A). Noun + っぽい: To obviously not be (A), although show signs of being (A). From this, we can see that 「っぽい」 is generally based on the opinion of the speaker, rather than the innate qualities of what is being observed. Thus, with verbs, adjectives, and nouns, the speaker feels like (A) is in excess, compared to what would be expected. This 'being in excess of what is normal' in the opinion of the speaker is what creates the negative connotation.",
