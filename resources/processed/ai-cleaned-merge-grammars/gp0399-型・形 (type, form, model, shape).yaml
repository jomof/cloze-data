        "usage-context": "General use for describing types, models, patterns, forms, or shapes, often attached to nouns. While 型 focuses on archetypes or molds, 形 emphasizes physical shape. Reading as けい is usually found in compound words referring to structured forms or systems rather than simple suffixes. The reading かた/がた is for suffixal use to indicate type, model, or mold.",
        "nuance": "The core distinction lies between 「型」 as a model/type/mold (often for production or classification) and 「形」 as a physical shape/form/appearance. 「型」 emphasizes a standard or archetype, while 「形」 emphasizes visual characteristics. When read as 「けい」, often in compound words, it signifies a structured 'form' or 'style' within a system. The rendaku phenomenon (かた to がた) is common when 「型」 is directly attached to a preceding noun, but it typically remains 「かた」 when the noun is connected by 「の」.",

        "logical-flow": "Used to categorize, specify a design, or describe a physical outline. The usage often depends on whether one is referring to an abstract category/model or a concrete visual form. The 'kei' reading often implies a more systematic or formal 'form'."
    },
    "etymology": "The kanji 「型」 means \"mold,\" \"type,\" or \"model.\" It comes from the idea of something being formed or shaped according to a particular standard or pattern. Therefore, when attached as a suffix, it indicates that something is of a certain type or follows a certain pattern. The alternate kanji 「形」 (かたち/がた/けい) primarily denotes physical \"shape\" or \"form.\" The common pronunciation shift from 「かた」 to 「がた」 (rendaku) occurs when 「型」 is directly attached to a preceding noun, but it reverts to 「かた」 when preceded by the particle 「の」. In some established compound words, 「型」 can also take its on'yomi (Chinese reading) as 「けい」.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「型」 (かた/がた) is primarily used to indicate the type, model, pattern, or design of something. It is commonly attached directly to nouns, and its pronunciation typically changes from 「かた」 to 「がた」 due to rendaku (連濁), a sequential voicing phenomenon in Japanese. For example, 「新型」 (しんがた - new model) or 「人間型」 (にんげんがた - human type).\n\nHowever, when 「型」 is preceded by the particle 「の」, it often refers to a specific mold, template, or design used for creation, and its pronunciation remains 「かた」。 For example, 「ケーキの型」 (ケーキのかた - cake mold).\n\nWhile 「型」 is used for abstract or general types and models, the kanji 「形」 (かたち/がた/けい) is specifically used for concrete, physical shapes or forms. For instance, 「星形」 (ほしがた - star shape) refers to the physical outline. If you are describing a geometric or physical contour, 「形」 is the appropriate choice. Though both kanji can be read as かた or がた, 「型」 is more common for abstract types, while 「形」 for visual shapes.\n\nOccasionally, 「型」 can also be read as 「けい」 (its on'yomi or Chinese reading) when it is part of specific compound words, especially in more formal or technical contexts, such as 「形式」 (けいしき - format) or 「典型」 (てんけい - typical form). This usage is less about a direct suffixation and more about being a component of a fixed term.",

This use of 「形」 in its on'yomi (Chinese reading) 「けい」 often appears in technical or abstract terms that describe established systems, structures, or conventions, rather than physical shapes."
