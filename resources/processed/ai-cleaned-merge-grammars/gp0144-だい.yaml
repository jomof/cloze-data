    "writeup": "「だい」is a sentence-ending particle mainly used by males in informal speech to emphasize a question or a request. It's considered a more direct and casual way of speaking. Although it can be used by women in some contexts, it's much more common among men. It is often used in situations where the speaker wants to confirm something or express curiosity. 「だい」is typically attached to the end of a sentence, following a noun, na-adjective, or the informal form of a verb or i-adjective. The phrase 「～んだい」 is another pattern used to add emphasis and inquiry.",
