    "writeup": "「だい」 is a sentence-ending particle mainly used by males in informal speech to add emphasis to questions or requests. It often carries a sense of familiarity or casualness. Though it can be used by women, it often sounds affected or childish. It is considered **very informal**, so it's generally avoided in polite or formal situations. It's often used with interrogative words, but can also be used with declarative sentences for emphasis. 「だい」 can be attached directly to the stem of *na*-adjectives or nouns, dropping the 「な」.",
    "etymology": "The particle 「だい」 is considered a contraction of 「だ」 (the plain form of the copula 「です」) and 「い」, where 「い」 adds a questioning or emphatic tone. It's akin to asking for confirmation or seeking agreement.",
