    "etymology": "「だい」 is a colloquial contraction of 「～です」, often used in informal male speech. Its evolution reflects a trend towards more direct and emphatic forms in casual language.",
    "writeup": "「だい」 is a sentence-ending particle primarily used by males in informal speech. Its main function is to add emphasis to questions or requests, making them sound more direct and sometimes more assertive than a simple question mark. It can also be appended to declarative sentences, particularly in boys' speech, to add emphasis or a sense of assertion, though this usage is less common for adult males. While predominantly masculine, it can be rarely heard from women in certain contexts, though it generally maintains a very casual or even rough nuance if used by female speakers. It's often employed when the speaker seeks strong confirmation or expresses a direct inquiry. 「だい」 typically follows the informal forms of verbs and i-adjectives, or the stem of na-adjectives and nouns. The form 「～んだい」 is a common variation, often used to add further emphasis or an explanatory nuance to the inquiry.",
