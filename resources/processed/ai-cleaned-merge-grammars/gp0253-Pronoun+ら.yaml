    "etymology": "The suffix 「ら」 comes from the kanji 「等」, which means \"etc.\" or \"and so on.\" This origin gives 「ら」 the nuance of indicating 'more than one' of something, similar to a pluralizing suffix.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「ら」 is attached to pronouns to indicate plurality. It originates from the kanji 「等」, carrying a meaning similar to \"etc.\" or \"and so on.\" Because of this etymology, 「ら」 suggests that there is more than one of the pronoun being referred to. For example, 「彼ら」 (karera) means \"they\" (masculine or mixed group), 「彼女ら」 (kanojora) means \"they\" (feminine), 「これら」 (korera) means \"these\", and 「それら」 (sorera) means \"those\". However, it's crucial to be aware that 「ら」 can sometimes be perceived as rude or dismissive, especially when used to refer to people. This is because its literal meaning of \"etc.\" or \"and so on\" can imply a lack of individual attention or respect for the people being referred to. For this reason, it is generally recommended to avoid using 「ら」 for people unless the context is very casual or informal, or if a slightly dismissive tone is intended. In many situations, especially when referring to people, 「達」 (tachi) is a more appropriate and polite alternative. 「達」 is commonly used with pronouns like 「私」 (watashi) to form 「私達」 (watashitachi - we), or with names like 「田中さん」 (Tanaka-san) to form 「田中さん達」 (Tanaka-san-tachi - Mr./Ms. Tanaka and others). 「ら」 is more commonly encountered with pronouns like 「彼」 (kare - he/they), 「彼女」 (kanojo - she/they), 「俺」 (ore - I, masculine casual), 「君」 (kimi - you, casual), and 「奴」 (yatsu - guy/thing, derogatory/very casual). It is also frequently used with demonstratives like 「これ」 (kore - this), 「それ」 (sore - that), and 「あれ」 (are - that over there) to form 「これら」, 「それら」, 「あれら」, which refer to plural objects or concepts.",
