pronunciation:
  katakana: ママニ
  romaji: mama ni
formation:
  Verb (dictionary form) + ままに: To perform an action as one pleases, without conscious planning or restraint,
    following one's inclination or impulse.
jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: general
  function: Describes an action performed without restraint or conscious planning, following one's own
    inclination or the natural flow of things.
  nuance: Implies a lack of resistance or control, a surrender to impulse, intuition, or the natural state
    of things. It suggests that the action is driven by an internal state (desire, thought, feeling) or
    an external natural force (wind, feet leading).
  colocation: Often used with verbs related to movement (e.g., 歩く, 旅 を する), thought (e.g., 思う, 思いつく),
    or natural forces (e.g., 風 が 吹く, 気 の 向く).
  grammatical-role: Functions adverbially, modifying the main verb of the sentence.
  logical-flow: Indicates that the action proceeds according to the preceding state or desire.
  temporal-flow: Implies simultaneity or immediate consequence of the preceding state/desire.
  spatial-flow: Can describe movement that is unguided by a fixed destination, as in "wherever one's feet
    lead."
etymology: The grammar point 「ままに」 is derived from the noun 「まま」 meaning "as is" or "unchanged state,"
  combined with the case-marking particle 「に」. This combination creates the sense of doing something according
  to the current state or feeling, without alteration or resistance. The evolution from a simple noun
  + particle to a compound grammatical expression emphasizes the inherent lack of conscious control or
  deviation from the given condition.
writeup: 「ままに」 indicates performing an action as one wishes, feels, or pleases. It conveys a sense of
  spontaneity and lack of restraint. Unlike the 「ままに」 used with passive structures like 「～される」 or 「～させられる」,
  which means "to do as one is told" or "to be done to as is," this usage of 「ままに」 emphasizes the agent's
  own free will and uninhibited action. It is a combination of the noun 「まま」 ("as is" or "unchanged state")
  and the case-marking particle 「に」. Commonly used with verbs in the dictionary form, it expresses actions
  done naturally, without deliberate control. Frequent collocations include 「気 の 向く ままに」 ("as the mood
  strikes"), 「思う ままに」 ("as one thinks"), 「足 の 向く ままに」 ("wherever one's feet lead"), 「風 の 吹く ままに」 ("wherever
  the wind blows"). Due to its nuance of natural flow, the range of verbs used with 「ままに」 is somewhat
  limited, primarily focusing on expressions of will, thought, or uncontrolled movement. This expression
  is generally suitable for a semi-formal register.
false_friends:
  - term: したがって
    meaning: Therefore, thus, as a result
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「ままに」, 「したがって」 indicates a logical consequence or a cause-and-effect relationship,
      implying that something follows as a result of a previous statement or action. It does not carry
      the nuance of spontaneity or following one's own desires or nature. For example, 「雨 が 降った 。 したがって
      、 試合 は 中止 に なった 。」 (It rained. Therefore, the game was cancelled.)
    grammar_point: したがって (therefore)
  - term: とおり
    meaning: In that way, exactly, precisely, just as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「とおり」 also describes something happening "as is," it emphasizes strict adherence to
      a pre-existing model, instruction, or expectation. It means doing something exactly according to
      a certain way or rule, implying a lack of deviation, whereas 「ままに」 implies a lack of restraint or
      conscious planning. For example, 「先生 が 言った とおり に 書いた 。」 (I wrote exactly as the teacher said.)
    grammar_point: とおり (exactly as)
  - term: 好きなように
    meaning: As one likes; freely; in any way one pleases
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While similar in meaning, 「ままに」 often carries a nuance of acting purely on an internal impulse,
      intuition, or the natural flow of things, rather than a conscious choice of 'how one likes'. It
      can feel more passive or spontaneous than the active choice implied by 「好きなように」. For example, 「好きなように
      選んで ください 。」 (Please choose as you like.)
    grammar_point: <suggest>:好きなように (as one likes)
  - term: 好きなだけ
    meaning: As much as one likes; as many as one likes; to one's heart's content
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「好きなだけ」 specifies the quantity or extent of something being done, emphasizing freedom in terms
      of amount. 「ままに」, on the other hand, focuses on the manner or condition of the action, suggesting
      it's done without restraint or according to one's inherent inclination. For example, 「好きなだけ 食べて
      ください 。」 (Please eat as much as you like.)
    grammar_point: <suggest>:好きなだけ (as much as one likes)
  - term: まま (noun)
    meaning: as is, unchanged state
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～まま」 as a noun describes a state or condition, emphasizing that something remains in that
      state without change. It doesn't convey the active 'doing as one pleases' aspect of 「ままに」. For example,
      「服 を 着た まま 寝る」 (to sleep with clothes on) implies the state of wearing clothes, not the action of
      sleeping freely.
    grammar_point: まま (as is)
  - term: 勝手に
    meaning: on one's own accord, arbitrarily, selfishly
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「勝手に」 also implies acting freely, it often carries a negative connotation of acting
      selfishly, without permission, or in an arbitrary way that might inconvenience others. 「ままに」 is
      generally neutral or positive, emphasizing alignment with internal desires or natural flow without
      such negative implications. For example, 「勝手 に ドア を 開ける な」 (Don't open the door without permission).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:勝手に (on one's own accord)
  - term: ままならない
    meaning: not going as one wishes, not manageable
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「ままならない」 is an antonym, meaning things are *not* going as one wishes or are not manageable.
      It is the direct opposite of the desire for freedom implied by 「ままに」. For example, 「体 が 思う ように ままならない」
      (My body doesn't move as I wish it would).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ままならない (not going as one wishes)
post_false_friends_writeup: While expressions like 「したがって」, 「とおり」, 「好きなように」, 「好きなだけ」, 「まま」, 「勝手に」, and
  「ままならない」 might appear to overlap with 「ままに」, their specific nuances differ. 「したがって」 indicates logical
  consequence, 「とおり」 implies adherence to a rule, 「好きなように」 denotes freedom of choice in action, and 「好きなだけ」
  refers to freedom in quantity. 「まま」 describes a state as it is, while 「勝手に」 often carries a negative
  connotation of selfishness or arbitrariness. 「ままならない」 is a direct antonym, expressing a lack of control.
  In contrast, 「ままに」 distinctly conveys actions driven by instinct, intuition, or the natural course of
  events, often implying a surrender to these forces rather than a deliberate decision.
