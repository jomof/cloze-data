        "usage-context": "general",

        "nuance": "Implies a lack of resistance or control, a surrender to impulse, intuition, or circumstances. It suggests that the action is driven by an internal state (desire, thought, feeling) or an external natural force (wind, feet leading).",

    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ままに」 is derived from the noun 「まま」 meaning \"as is\" or \"unchanged state,\" combined with the case-marking particle 「に」. This combination creates the sense of doing something according to the current state or feeling, without alteration or resistance. The evolution from a simple noun + particle to a compound grammatical expression emphasizes the inherent lack of conscious control or deviation from the given condition.",
    "writeup": "「ままに」 indicates performing an action as one wishes, feels, or pleases. It conveys a sense of spontaneity and lack of restraint. Unlike the 「ままに」 used with passive structures like 「～される」 or 「～させられる」, which means \"to do as one is told\" or \"to be done to as is,\" this usage of 「ままに」 emphasizes the agent's own free will and uninhibited action. It is a combination of the noun 「まま」 (\"as is\" or \"unchanged state\") and the case-marking particle 「に」. Commonly used with verbs in the dictionary form, it expresses actions done naturally, without deliberate control. Frequent collocations include 「気の向くままに」 (\"as the mood strikes\"), 「思うままに」 (\"as one thinks\"), 「足の向くままに」 (\"wherever one's feet lead\"), 「風の吹くままに」 (\"wherever the wind blows\"). Due to its nuance of natural flow, the range of verbs used with 「ままに」 is somewhat limited, primarily focusing on expressions of will, thought, or uncontrolled movement. This expression is generally suitable for a semi-formal register.",

While similar in meaning, 「ままに」 often carries a nuance of acting purely on an internal impulse, intuition, or the natural flow of things, rather than a conscious choice of 'how one likes'. It can feel more passive or spontaneous than the active choice implied by 「好きなように」. For example, 「好きなように選んでください。」 (Please choose as you like.)"

In contrast, 「ままに」 distinctly conveys actions driven by instinct, intuition, or the natural course of events, often implying a surrender to these forces rather than a deliberate decision.",
