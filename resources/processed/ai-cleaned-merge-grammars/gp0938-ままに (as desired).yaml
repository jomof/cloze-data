    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ままに」 is derived from the noun 「まま」 meaning \"as is\" or \"unchanged state,\" combined with the particle 「に」. This combination creates the sense of doing something according to the current state or feeling, without alteration or resistance.",
    "writeup": "「ままに」 indicates performing an action as one wishes, feels, or pleases. It conveys a sense of spontaneity and lack of restraint. It is a combination of the noun 「まま」 (\"as is\") and the case-marking particle 「に」. Commonly used with verbs in the dictionary form, it expresses actions done naturally, without deliberate control. Frequent collocations include 「気の向くままに」 (\"as the mood strikes\"), 「思うままに」 (\"as one thinks\"), 「足の向くままに」 (\"wherever one's feet lead\"), 「風の吹くままに」 (\"wherever the wind blows\"). Due to its nuance of natural flow, the range of verbs used with 「ままに」 is somewhat limited.",
