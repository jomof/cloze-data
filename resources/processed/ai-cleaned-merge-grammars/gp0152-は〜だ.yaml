    "etymology": "The particle は originates from the verb 葉 (ha), meaning 'leaf,' and was originally used to indicate a separation or distinction. だ is a contraction of である (de aru), a more formal copula.",
    "writeup": "は〜だ is a fundamental Japanese sentence structure used to state facts, provide descriptions, and make identifications in **casual speech**. Here, は marks the topic of the sentence, indicating what the sentence is about. だ is a copula, functioning like \"is\" in English, and connects the topic with the predicate (the information about the topic). Its polite equivalent is です. For example, 「これは本**だ**」 (kore wa hon da) means \"This is a book.\"  The particle used with the noun or noun phrase between のは and だ usually drops if the particle does not have any concrete meaning (as in the cases of が and を), or if the meaning of the entire sentence is somehow predictable.",
