    "etymology": "「は」 is a topic marker particle, originating from the hiragana form of the kanji 「波」, meaning 'wave,' initially used to indicate contrast. 「だ」 is a copula derived from the classical Japanese auxiliary verb 「なり」, which evolved to indicate assertion or declaration.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「は〜だ」 is a fundamental sentence structure in Japanese used to **identify the topic** of a sentence and then provide information or a description about that topic. \n\nThe particle 「は」 marks the topic, while 「だ」 (casual) or 「です」 (polite) acts as a copula, connecting the topic to the information being presented. \n\nKey points:\n*   「は」 is pronounced as 「わ」 when used as a topic marker.\n*   「だ」 is considered casual speech, while 「です」 is polite. Using 「です」 shows respect to the listener.\n*   The structure can be used with nouns, adjectives, and verbs in certain forms.\n*   Negative forms such as 「ではない」 and 「ではありません」 are used to negate the information being presented about the topic. You can also use 「じゃない」 as a more casual negative form, although 「ではない」 is more grammatically correct.",
