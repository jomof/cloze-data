        "「Quotation」 + と": "Indicates direct or indirect quotations, thoughts, or the content of actions like thinking, writing, or hearing.",
        "Phonomime/Phenomime/Psychomime + と": "Describes sounds, states, or manners of actions."
    },
    "jlpt": "N3",
    "meaning": "In the manner of; as; like; that",
    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "particle",
        "function": "Marks quotations, sounds, manners, and content of thoughts or actions.",
        "colocation": "Used extensively with onomatopoeia (phonomimes), phenomimes (describing states), and psychomimes (describing feelings)."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「と」 originally indicated co-occurrence or accompaniment. Over time, it evolved to mark direct quotations as the words being 'said with' the action of speaking. Its use expanded to encompass indirect quotations, thoughts, and manners, retaining the core sense of association or equivalence.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「と」 is versatile, serving multiple functions primarily related to indicating **content or manner**. It's commonly used to mark direct quotations, indirect quotations, and even one's own internal thoughts, connecting with verbs like 思う (to think), 考える (to consider), 書く (to write), or 聞く (to hear). Furthermore, 「と」 connects actions with sounds, states, or manners, often appearing with various mimetic words. For instance, with onomatopoeia (phonomimes) like バタバタ (clattering noise), phenomimes (describing states) like しっとり (gently), or psychomimes (describing feelings) like うきうき (cheerfully). An important nuance regarding mimetic words is that while 「と」 can sometimes be omitted when the mimetic word is repeated (e.g., バタバタ), it is generally required when the mimetic word is not repeated (e.g., バタンと, for a single loud bang). These mimetic expressions are a significant part of the Japanese vocabulary, not merely childish utterances.",

                    "competing_grammar": "先生 は 生徒 たち に、「おはよう。」 と 言いました。",
                    "mitigation": "This example emphasizes the content of the greeting, 「おはよう」, directly linked to the action 「声 を かけました」 without explicitly stating the verb 'to say'. The scene clarifies that the teacher is giving a direct greeting rather than simply reporting speech."

            "etymology": "The etymology of 「おはよう」 is interesting! It's an abbreviation of 「お早くからご苦労様です」, literally, 'Thank you for your hard work from early in the morning.'"
