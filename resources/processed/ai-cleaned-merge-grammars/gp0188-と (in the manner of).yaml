    "writeup": "The particle 「と」 has several important functions. Primarily, it marks direct and indirect quotations, functioning similarly to \"that\" in English. For example, 「トムは日本へ行きたいと言っている (Tom wa Nihon e ikitai to itteiru)」 means \"Tom says that he wants to go to Japan.\"  「と」 is essential for both direct (「こんにちは」と言った) and indirect quotations. Secondly, 「と」 is used with onomatopoeia (words that imitate sounds) and mimetic words (words that describe manners or states). For instance, 「子供達はバタバタと走れ回った (Kodomotachi wa batabata to hashirimawatta)」 describes children running around with a clattering noise.  Note that when the sound is repeated, such as 「バタバタ」, 「と」 can sometimes be omitted.  Finally, 「と」 can also describe a manner or state, like 「しっかりと手を握った (shikkari to te o nigitta)」, meaning someone \"firmly grabbed my hand\".",
    "etymology": "The particle 「と」 likely evolved from earlier grammatical forms used to indicate conjunction or accompaniment. Its connection to the verb 「言う (iu)」, meaning \"to say,\" suggests its early association with marking quoted speech.",
