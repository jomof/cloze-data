        "colocation": "Used extensively with onomatopoeia (phonomimes), phenomimes (describing states), and psychomimes (describing feelings)."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「と」 originally indicated co-occurrence or accompaniment. Over time, it evolved to mark direct quotations as the words being 'said with' the action of speaking. Its use expanded to encompass indirect quotations, thoughts, and manners, retaining the core sense of association or equivalence.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「と」 is versatile, serving multiple functions primarily related to indicating **content or manner**. It's commonly used to mark direct quotations, indirect quotations, and even one's own internal thoughts, connecting with verbs like 思う (to think), 考える (to consider), 書く (to write), or 聞く (to hear). Furthermore, 「と」 connects actions with sounds, states, or manners, often appearing with various mimetic words. For instance, with onomatopoeia (phonomimes) like バタバタ (clattering noise), phenomimes (describing states) like しっとり (gently), or psychomimes (describing feelings) like うきうき (cheerfully). An important nuance regarding mimetic words is that while 「と」 can sometimes be omitted when the mimetic word is repeated (e.g., バタバタ), it is generally required when the mimetic word is not repeated (e.g., バタンと, for a single loud bang). These mimetic expressions are a significant part of the Japanese vocabulary, not merely childish utterances.",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「と」, 「～って」 is an informal, conversational particle used for quoting or reporting information, often implying the speaker is relaying something they heard or that is generally known. 「と」 is more formal and universally applicable for direct and indirect quotations, as well as for marking various mimetic words.",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「と」, which directly marks the way something is done or said (often with onomatopoeia/mimetics), 「～ように」 describes something as being *like* or *as if* it were a certain way, focusing on comparison rather than direct description of the manner itself. It also has other uses like 'so that' or 'in order to'.",
            "grammar_point": "ように (like)"
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion between these expressions, remember that 「と」 is used for the *exact content* of a quote or thought, or the *direct manner* of an action often with onomatopoeic words. 「～って」 is a more casual, spoken form of 「と」, often used when reporting something heard. 「～ように」, however, introduces a comparison or similarity, meaning 'like' or 'as if', rather than directly describing the manner itself.",
