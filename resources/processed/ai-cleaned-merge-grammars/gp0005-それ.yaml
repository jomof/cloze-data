    "etymology": "「それ」 comes from the verb 「添う (そう)」 which means \"to accompany\" or \"to be close to.\" Over time, 「そう」 evolved into 「それ」, indicating something close to the listener or the topic at hand.",
    "writeup": "「それ」 is a pronoun (代名詞, *daimeishi*) that translates to \"that\" in English. It points to something closer to the listener than the speaker, whether physically present or conceptually related to the listener's knowledge or recent statements. Furthermore, 「それ」 can refer back to something previously mentioned in the conversation, serving as a cohesive device to link ideas or statements. It can be used to refer to something said earlier within the same sentence or something another person has just said. It is part of the Ko-So-A-Do series of demonstratives, which indicate relative distance: 「これ」 refers to something close to the speaker. 「あれ」 refers to something distant from both the speaker and listener. 「どれ」 is an interrogative pronoun used to ask \"which one?\" among several items. Understanding the relative distance — close to speaker (ko), close to listener (so), distant from both (a), or interrogative (do) — is key to correctly using these pronouns.",

            "nuance": "「あ、{それ}」 uses 「それ」 to directly refer to the book the listener is holding. The particle 「あ」 conveys a sudden realization or gentle correction. The possessive 「私の」 indicates ownership, common in casual exchanges."

In contrast, 「それにしても」, which uses 「それ」 to refer to the whole preceding circumstance (being the first time at the shop), conveys a sense of surprise or remark given that circumstance. The scene implies the speaker is making an observation that exceeds their expectation, which fits 「それにしても」 better."
