    "etymology": "The word 「それ」 is believed to have originated from the verb 「添う」 (sou), meaning to accompany or be close to. Over time, it evolved to indicate something near or associated with the listener.",
    "writeup": "Just like 「これ」, 「それ」 is considered a pronoun in Japanese. More accurately, it's a substitute noun. 「それ」 translates roughly to \"that\" and highlights something closer to the listener (physically or emotionally) than the speaker.\n\n「それ」 is also used to point back to things that have been mentioned previously in the conversation. This can be something said earlier within the same sentence or something someone else said. It indicates a degree of separation from the speaker, implying the object or concept is more associated with or known to the listener.",
