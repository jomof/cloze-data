    "writeup": "「それ」 is a pronoun (代名詞, *daimeishi*) that translates to \"that\" in English. It points to something closer to the listener than the speaker, either physically or conceptually.\n\n「それ」 can also refer back to something previously mentioned in the conversation, whether in the same sentence or by another speaker. Think of it as a way to say, \"That thing we were just talking about.\"\n\n*   「これ」 refers to something close to the speaker.\n*   「あれ」 refers to something distant from both the speaker and listener.",
