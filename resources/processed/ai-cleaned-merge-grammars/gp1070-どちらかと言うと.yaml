        "function": "Expresses a preference or inclination toward one option or characteristic over another.",
        "nuance": "Used to soften a statement or to avoid being too direct. The phrase implies a comparison, even if the alternative isn't explicitly stated. It often precedes or is used in conjunction with 「～より(は)」 to make the comparison explicit and highlight a subtle preference or leaning.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as an introductory phrase or adverbial expression, setting the tone for a statement of preference or tendency."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase literally translates to \"if one were to say which one...\" 「どちら」 means \"which one\" or \"which way,\" 「と」 is a quotative particle, and 「言う」 means \"to say.\" This etymology directly reflects its function as a tentative expression of preference or a subtle comparison, inviting the listener to consider the speaker's leaning rather than asserting an absolute choice.",
    "writeup": "「どちらかと言うと」 (dochira ka to iu to) is a versatile phrase used to express a **preference**, a **tendency**, or a **subtle inclination** towards one thing over another. It conveys a sense of **tentativeness** or **softening** a statement, indicating that while multiple possibilities exist, the speaker leans towards a particular option or description.\n\nIt can be translated as \"rather,\" \"more like,\" \"more of,\" or \"if I had to say.\" This phrase is particularly useful when you want to make a comparison without being overly definitive or assertive. It often precedes or is paired with comparative structures like 「〜より(は)」 to explicitly highlight the two options being weighed.\n\nWhile versatile, it maintains a **neutral register**, suitable for both casual conversation and more formal contexts depending on the overall sentence structure and politeness levels. There are no specific gender, age, or regional biases associated with its usage; it's a generally accepted and understood expression across various demographics in Japan.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "「どちらかと言うと」 and 「どちらかと言えば」 are very similar in meaning and often interchangeable, both softening a statement of preference or tendency. The nuance between them is very subtle, with 「どちらかと言えば」 perhaps leaning slightly more towards the act of making a choice. In contrast, 「むしろ」 is used when you want to express a stronger preference or a correction, indicating that what follows is a more accurate or preferred alternative than something previously mentioned or implied.",
