        "Register": "Neutral, can be used in both formal and informal contexts depending on the overall tone.",
        "Function": "Expresses a preference or inclination toward one option or characteristic over another.",

        "どちらかと言うと": "Used to express a preference or inclination. It suggests a tentative choice between two options."
    },
    "etymology": "「どちら」 (dochira) means \"which way\" or \"which one.\" 「と」 (to) is a particle indicating quotation or saying. 「言う」 (iu) means \"to say.\" So, literally, 「どちらかと言うと」 means \"if I were to say which one,\" implying a tentative choice or preference.",
    "writeup": "「どちらかと言うと」 (dochira ka to iu to) is used to express a preference or inclination when choosing between two options or describing something. It's similar to saying \"rather\" or \"more like\" in English. It indicates that while both options might be possible, the speaker leans more towards one of them.\n\nIt's often used to soften a statement or to avoid being too direct. The phrase implies a comparison, even if the alternative isn't explicitly stated. You'll often see 「～より」 (yori) used with it to make the comparison more explicit.",
