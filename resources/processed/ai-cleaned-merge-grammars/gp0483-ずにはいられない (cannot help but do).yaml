details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Often used in formal or literary contexts, conveying a strong, uncontrollable internal
    compulsion or emotional state. It implies that the action or feeling is deeply ingrained or inevitable
    given the circumstances.
  function: Expresses an uncontrollable internal compulsion or an irresistible urge to perform an action
    or experience an emotion.
  nuance: Emphasizes that the action or feeling is deeply ingrained or inevitable, driven by an internal,
    personal experience rather than an external obligation or logical necessity. It highlights a psychological
    state where one is powerless to prevent a certain action or emotion from occurring.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a predicate, describing the subject's unavoidable action or feeling.
  logical-flow: Implies a strong cause-and-effect relationship where an internal state inevitably leads
    to a certain action or emotion.
  spatial-flow: Used for actions tied to one's internal state, not physical movement in space.
etymology: The expression 「ずにはいられない」 is rooted in classical Japanese grammar. 「ず」 is an archaic negative
  auxiliary verb, serving a similar function to the modern 「ない」. It attaches to the Mizenkei (indeterminate
  form) of verbs. The particle 「に」 indicates a result or state, while 「は」 adds emphasis or contrast, similar
  to its modern function as a topic marker. 「いられない」 is the negative potential form of the verb 「いる」 (to
  be/exist), literally meaning 'cannot exist'. Thus, the combination literally translates to "cannot exist
  without doing [something]", or "cannot be without doing [something]". Over time, this evolved into the
  contemporary meaning of expressing an irresistible urge or an action that one simply cannot refrain
  from performing.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「ずにはいられない」 conveys a strong, internal compulsion to do something or to feel a certain way, suggesting that the action or emotion is unavoidable for the speaker. It is typically used for involuntary actions or overwhelming feelings that are difficult to control.

  **Formation:** It attaches to the negative stem of verbs (the same stem used for the ない form). For most verbs, this is straightforward (e.g., 食べる → 食べずにはいられない). However, for the irregular verb する, it conjugates to せずにはいられない, not しずにはいられない.

  **Nuance:** While often translated as "cannot help but do" or "cannot resist doing," the literal meaning is "cannot be without doing." This highlights that the speaker's state or existence is intertwined with the action or feeling, making it impossible to omit. It emphasizes an internal, personal experience, rather than an external obligation or logical necessity.

  **Usage:** This expression tends to be more formal or literary compared to other similar phrases, and you will often encounter it in written Japanese or more deliberate speech. It describes a psychological state where one is powerless to prevent a certain action or emotion from occurring.
false_friends:
  - term: ないわけにはいかない
    meaning: Can't not; no way to avoid; must do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ないわけにはいかない」 implies an external necessity or social obligation, meaning one 'must' do something.
      In contrast, 「ずにはいられない」 describes an deep internal, irresistible urge or compulsion.
    grammar_point: ないわけにはいかない (inevitable necessity)
  - term: てしょうがない
    meaning: Extremely; very; can't help but feel/be
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「てしょうがない」 emphasizes the degree of a feeling or state to an overwhelming extent (e.g., 'so
      tired I can't stand it'). While it can express an uncontrollable feeling, it doesn't directly imply
      an *action* one cannot resist performing, unlike 「ずにはいられない」.
    grammar_point: てしょうがない (cannot help but)
  - term: ずに
    meaning: Without doing
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「ずに」 is simply a negative conjunction meaning 'without doing X'. It is a component of 「ずにはいられない」
      but does not carry the meaning of internal compulsion on its own. Confusing the two would omit the
      'cannot help' nuance.
    grammar_point: ずに (without doing)
  - term: てたまらない
    meaning: Can't help but feel/want to; very; extremely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「てしょうがない」, 「てたまらない」 indicates an overwhelming feeling or desire. However, it focuses
      more on an uncontrollable *want* or *emotion* rather than an irresistible *action*, which is the
      core of 「ずにはいられない」.
    grammar_point: てたまらない (unbearably extremely)
  - term: ないではいられない
    meaning: Cannot help doing something; cannot resist doing something
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ないではいられない」 is very similar in meaning and usage to 「ずにはいられない」. However, 「ずにはいられない」 is generally
      considered slightly more formal or literary, while 「ないではいられない」 might feel marginally more conversational.
    grammar_point: ないではいられない (cannot help but do)
  - term: てならない
    meaning: Very; extremely; can't help but feel
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「てならない」 often expresses a spontaneous or natural feeling that one feels strongly about. It
      is more about a feeling growing to an intense degree (e.g., 'I feel so sorry') and less about an
      action one cannot resist performing, distinguishing it from 「ずにはいられない」.
    grammar_point: てならない (uncontrollably feels)
  - term: ざるを得ない
    meaning: Can't help doing; have no choice but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ざるを得ない」 signifies that one has no choice but to do something due to external circumstances
      or logical necessity. This contrasts with 「ずにはいられない」, which emphasizes an internal, personal compulsion
      or irresistible urge.
    grammar_point: ざるを得ない (have no choice but to)
  - term: わけにはいかない
    meaning: Cannot afford to; no way; impossible to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「わけにはいかない」 indicates that something cannot be done due to social rules, common sense, or a
      moral imperative. It's about what is permissible or possible, not about an internal, uncontrollable
      urge to perform an action, differentiating it from 「ずにはいられない」.
    grammar_point: わけにはいかない (cannot afford to)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between 「ずにはいられない」 and similar expressions, consider the nature
  of the compulsion. Use 「ずにはいられない」 when the driving force is an internal, irresistible urge or an overwhelming
  emotion that makes an action or feeling unavoidable. For external obligations or logical necessities,
  consider expressions like 「ないわけにはいかない (inevitable necessity)」 or 「ざるを得ない (have no choice but to)」. If
  you are simply emphasizing the extreme degree of a feeling, 「てしょうがない (uncontrollable feeling)」, 「てたまらない
  (unbearably extremely)」, or 「てならない (uncontrollably feels)」 might be more appropriate. Remember that
  「ないではいられない (cannot help but do)」 is a very close alternative, though slightly less formal.

        english: Upon hearing about the client's difficult situation, I thought I should worry.

        english: When I concentrate for a long time, I get sleepy and end up yawning.
        hint: 「あくびをしてしまいます」 could suggest accidentally yawning or yawning against one's will, but might
          not convey the same strong sense of inevitability due to a physical state. We're looking for
          a biological compulsion.
    scene: A student is explaining to a study partner why they keep yawning during a long study session.
      They are genuinely exhausted and find it impossible to suppress the yawns.
