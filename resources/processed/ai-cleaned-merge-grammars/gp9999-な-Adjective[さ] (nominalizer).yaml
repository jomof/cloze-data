  - な-Adjective[み] (abstract quality)
id: gp9999
meaning: Converts a な-adjective into a noun, expressing the degree or extent of that quality.
pronunciation:
  katakana: サ
  romaji: sa
  pronunciation_warning: Although written as 「さ」, this is not a standalone word but a suffix. Its pronunciation
    is always attached to the stem of a な-adjective.
formation:
  な-Adjective (stem) + さ: Forms a noun representing the degree or extent of the quality described by the
    な-adjective.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The suffix 「さ」 (sa) historically derives from the classical Japanese nominalizing suffix 「さま」
  (sama), which was attached to the *ren'yōkei* (conjunctive form) of adjectives and verbs to form nouns.
  Over time, 「さま」 shortened to 「さ」. While 「さま」 retained broader nominalizing functions, 「さ」 specialized
  in forming nouns that denote the *degree*, *extent*, or *state* of a quality, hence its common use with
  adjectives. It essentially transforms a qualitative description into a quantifiable or referable entity.
writeup: |-
  The suffix 「さ」 is a powerful tool in Japanese grammar that transforms adjectives into nouns, specifically emphasizing the **degree or extent** of the quality they describe. When appended to the stem of a な-adjective, it creates a noun that refers to the quality itself as a measurable entity. For instance, 「静か (shizuka - quiet)」 becomes 「静かさ (shizukasa - quietness/the degree of quietness)」, allowing you to discuss the abstract concept of quietness or its measurable level.

  This usage of 「さ」 is particularly common when discussing objective, quantifiable attributes like size, height, length, or warmth that can be measured or observed. While adjectives like 「高い (takai - high)」 directly describe something as "high," 「高さ (takasa - height)」 refers to the "height" itself as a noun. Similarly, 「便利な (benri na - convenient)」 describes something as "convenient," whereas 「便利さ (benrisa - convenience)」 is the noun form denoting the state or degree of being convenient.

  It's important to note that 「さ」 is one of several nominalizers in Japanese. Unlike 「こと」 or 「の」, which nominalize entire clauses or actions, 「さ」 specifically targets adjectives to create nouns of quality or degree. While 「さ」 can be used with both い-adjectives and な-adjectives, it's particularly useful for な-adjectives as they don't have an inherent noun form corresponding to their quality as directly as some い-adjectives might.

  - term: み (suffix inherent quality)
    meaning: suffix indicating an inherent quality or feeling, often subjective.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「さ」 and 「み」 are nominalizing suffixes, they convey different nuances. 「さ」, when
      attached to a な-adjective stem (e.g., 「静かさ」), typically refers to the *measurable degree* or *objective
      extent* of a quality. It allows for quantification or comparison of the quality. In contrast, 「み」
      (e.g., 「暖かみ」 warmth/feel of warmth, 「悲しみ」 sadness) tends to emphasize a more *inherent, qualitative,
      or subjective feeling* or *essence* of a quality. 「み」 is much more commonly used with い-adjectives,
      and its usage with な-adjectives is quite rare or limited to specific established words.
    grammar_point: な-Adjective[み] (abstract quality)
  - term: な-Adjective + なこと / な-Adjective + であること
    meaning: the fact that something is [な-adjective].
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「な-Adjective + さ」 forms a noun that represents the *degree* or *state* of the adjective's
      quality (e.g., 「静かさ」 'quietness'). On the other hand, 「な-Adjective + なこと」 or 「な-Adjective + であること」
      nominalizes an entire *clause* stating that something *is* that quality, focusing on the factual
      statement or circumstance rather than the quality's degree itself. For example, 「彼が静かなこと (kare ga
      shizuka na koto)」 means "the fact that he is quiet," while 「彼の静かさ (kare no shizukasa)」 means "his
      quietness."
    grammar_point: <suggest>:こと (the act of・the fact that)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the distinction between 「さ」 and other nominalizers like 「み」
  or 「こと」 is crucial for precise expression. Remember that 「さ」 is about the **degree or extent** of an
  adjective's quality, allowing it to function as a measurable noun. 「み」 is less about measurement and
  more about the **inherent, subjective feel** of a quality, primarily with い-adjectives. 「こと」 (or 「の」)
  acts as a general nominalizer for clauses, turning statements or actions into noun phrases. Choosing
  the correct nominalizer depends on whether you want to refer to the abstract quality, its measurable
  degree, or the fact of its existence.

      as an attribute for healthy discussion. The formal structure with 「にとっって」 and 「重要です」 is suitable

post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, using 「さ」 with な-adjectives allows you to talk about
  the quality itself as a noun, often in a way that suggests measurement, evaluation, or objective observation.
  This makes it distinct from other nominalizers and useful for expressing nuances related to the degree
  or extent of a characteristic.
