    "etymology": "The particle 「から」 originally indicated a starting point in time or space, meaning \"from.\" Over time, it evolved to also express the origin or cause of something, hence its use to mean \"because\" or \"since.\"",
    "writeup": "The particle 「から」 functions primarily to express a reason or cause, translating to \"because\" or \"since.\" Its core meaning originates from its use as a marker of a starting point, whether in time, space, or, in this context, causality. Therefore, \"Reason + から + Result\" can be understood as \"starting from this reason, a result follows.\"When 「から」 connects to a **noun** or a **な-adjective**, the copula 「だ」 must precede it. For example, 「学生だ{から}」 (because one is a student) or 「静かだ{から}」 (because it is quiet). However, when 「から」 follows a **verb** or an **い-adjective**, no 「だ」 is necessary. For instance, 「行った{から}」 (because I went) or 「高い{から}」 (because it is expensive).It is crucial to understand that the clause expressing the reason (the 「から」 clause) **always** precedes the main clause that states the result. This consistent ordering ensures clarity in expressing the causal relationship. While 「から」 is widely used across various registers, it often conveys a direct and sometimes subjective reason.",
