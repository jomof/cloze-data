    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「から」 originally indicated a starting point in time or space, meaning \"from.\" Over time, it evolved to also express the origin or cause of something, hence its use to mean \"because\" or \"since.\" This progression from a physical or temporal origin to a logical or causal origin is a common linguistic phenomenon. The 'from' aspect remains relevant, as it implies a causal chain originating from the stated reason.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「から」 functions primarily to express a reason or cause, translating to \"because\" or \"since.\" Its core meaning originates from its use as a marker of a starting point, whether in time, space, or, in this context, causality. Therefore, \"Reason + から + Result\" can be understood as \"starting from this reason, a result follows.\"When 「から」 connects to a **noun** or a **な-adjective**, the copula 「だ」 must precede it. For example, 「学生だ{から}」 (because one is a student) or 「静かだ{から}」 (because it is quiet). However, when 「から」 follows a **verb** or an **い-adjective**, no 「だ」 is necessary. For instance, 「行った{から}」 (because I went) or 「高い{から}」 (because it is expensive).It is crucial to understand that the clause expressing the reason (the 「から」 clause) **always** precedes the main clause that states the result. This consistent ordering ensures clarity in expressing the causal relationship. While 「から」 is widely used across various registers, it often conveys a direct and sometimes subjective reason. It can be used to assert personal opinions, justify actions, or state direct conclusions. In more casual settings, the final 「だ」 or 「です」 can be omitted after 「から」, making the sentence flow more naturally.",
