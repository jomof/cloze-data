    "etymology": "The particle 「から」 originally signified a starting point or origin, literally meaning \"from\". Over time, this sense of origin extended to reasons and causes, thus evolving to mean \"because\" or \"since\", indicating that something arises or results from a particular origin or cause.",
    "writeup": "「から」 is a particle that indicates a reason or cause. It's similar to \"because\" or \"since\" in English. The basic structure is: (Reason) + 「から」+ (Result). When 「から」 follows a noun or a な-adjective, it requires 「だ」 before it. For example: 「明日あしたは日曜日だから、嬉しい。」(Because tomorrow is Sunday, I'm happy.) 「から」 always comes after the reason and before the result.",
