    "etymology": "The particle 「から」 originally indicated a starting point in time or space, meaning \"from.\" Over time, it evolved to also express the origin or cause of something, hence its use to mean \"because\" or \"since.\"",
    "writeup": "The particle 「から」 primarily serves to express a reason or cause, translating to \"because\" or \"since\" in English. Its fundamental structure is \"Reason + から + Result.\" It is crucial to note that in Japanese, the clause stating the reason (the 「から」 clause) **always** precedes the main clause that expresses the result. For instance, while English might say \"I'm going to work *because* it's Monday,\" Japanese constructs it as \"It's Monday {だ}から, I'm going to work.\" \n\nWhen 「から」 follows a noun or a な-adjective, it requires the copula 「だ」 to be inserted immediately before it (e.g., 「学生だ{から}」 \"because they are a student,\" or 「静かだ{から}」 \"because it is quiet\"). However, when following a verb or an い-adjective, 「だ」 is not used (e.g., 「行った{から}」 \"because I went,\" 「高い{から}」 \"because it is expensive\").\n\nInterestingly, the underlying nuance of 「から」 can be traced back to its original meaning of \"from\" (as in a starting point in time or space). In this context, \"Reason + から\" can be conceptualized as \"starting from this reason\" or \"on the basis of this reason,\" leading to the subsequent result. This inherent sense of origin or basis is what allows 「から」 to function so effectively in indicating causality.\n\n「から」 is a versatile particle used across various registers, from casual conversation to more formal expressions.",
