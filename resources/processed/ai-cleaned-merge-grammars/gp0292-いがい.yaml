    "etymology": "The construction 以外 (igai) is a combination of the kanji 以 (i), meaning \"by means of\", and 外 (gai), meaning \"outside\". Therefore, it literally means \"outside of\" or \"beyond\".",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 以外 (igai) is used to express \"except (A)\" or \"besides (A)\". It indicates everything that is outside of or excluded from a particular noun. It can be translated as \"with the exception of (A)\" or \"everything outside of (A)\".\n\n*   To use 以外, attach it directly to the noun you want to exclude.\n*   It is worth noting that 以外 (igai) is sometimes confused with 意外 (igai), which means \"unexpected\" or \"surprising\". This confusion is common even among native speakers, and in many informal contexts, using 以外 when 意外 is technically more correct might still be understood. However, for precise communication, it is important to distinguish between them; 以外 refers to exclusion, while 意外 refers to surprise or an unexpected nature.",
