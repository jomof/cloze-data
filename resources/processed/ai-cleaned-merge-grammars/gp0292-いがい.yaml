    "etymology": "The construction 以外 (igai) is a combination of the kanji 以 (i), meaning \"by means of\", and 外 (gai), meaning \"outside\". Therefore, it literally means \"outside of\" or \"beyond\".",
    "writeup": "The grammar point **以外** (igai) is used to express \"except (A)\" or \"besides (A)\". It indicates everything that is outside of or excluded from a particular noun. It can be translated as \"with the exception of (A)\" or \"everything outside of (A)\". To use **以外**, attach it directly to the noun you want to exclude. This construction is a combination of the kanji 以 (meaning 'by means of'), and 外 ('outside').\n\nIt is crucial to distinguish **以外** from **意外** (igai). While both share the same pronunciation, **意外** is written with the kanji 意 (meaning 'intention' or 'mind') and 外 ('outside'), literally meaning 'out of mind'. **意外** expresses surprise or something unexpected – that which falls outside of one's expectations. This distinction is often overlooked even by native speakers in casual conversation, leading to misunderstanding. For precise communication, use **以外** for *exclusion* and **意外** for *unexpectedness*.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The expressions 「ほかに(も)・ほか(に)は」, 「はともかく」, 「を除いて」, and 「をおいてほかに〜ない」 can all express ideas of exclusion or alternatives, but they carry distinct nuances. 「以外」 emphasizes that something is 'outside' a defined category or set, marking it as an exception. 「ほかに」 often suggests 'in addition to' or 'any other', focusing on the existence of other options rather than strict exclusion. 「はともかく」 sets something aside for the moment, indicating it's not the primary focus of discussion. 「を除いて」 explicitly highlights the action of 'removing' or 'excluding' an item from a group, often implying a deliberate act. Lastly, 「をおいてほかに〜ない」 is a strong, emphatic phrase meaning 'none other than', stressing absolute uniqueness or exclusivity. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for precise expression in Japanese.",
