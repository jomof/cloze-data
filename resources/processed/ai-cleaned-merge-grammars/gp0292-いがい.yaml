    "etymology": "以外 (igai) combines 以 (i), meaning \"by means of\" or \"from,\" and 外 (gai), meaning \"outside.\" Thus, it literally means \"outside of\" or \"beyond,\" conceptually forming the idea of \"except for\" something.",
    "writeup": "以外 (igai) is used to express \"except for,\" \"besides,\" or \"other than\" something. It combines the kanji 以 (i), meaning \"by means of,\" and 外 (gai), meaning \"outside.\" Think of it as encompassing everything 'outside of' a specific item or concept. For example, 「納豆以外何でも食べられる」 means \"I can eat anything other than natto.\"\n\n**Important Note:**\n\n*   以外 (igai) is sometimes confused with 意外 (igai), which means \"unexpected\" or \"surprising.\" Both are pronounced the same, but have different kanji and meanings. Even native speakers sometimes mix them up!",
