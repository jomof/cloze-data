pronunciation:

formation:
  お + Japanese origin verb stem + になる: Expresses respect for someone's actions or states when the verb
    is of Japanese origin (訓読み).
  ご + Chinese origin verb stem + になる: Expresses respect for someone's actions or states when the verb
    is of Chinese origin (音読み).
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Used to show respect towards the actions of a person of higher status (e.g., a superior,
    elder, or customer). Never used for one's own actions.
  function: Elevates the action of the subject to show respect.
  nuance: This form conveys politeness and respect by indirectness. The use of お or ご depends on the etymology
    of the verb stem, with お for Japanese-origin words and ご for Chinese-origin words.
  colocation: Often used with subjects like 先生 (teacher), 社長 (company president), 教授 (professor), お客様
    (customer).
  grammatical-role: Functions as a main verb, replacing or modifying the base verb to express honorific
    meaning.
etymology: The construction 「お/ご〜になる」 combines a polite prefix (お or ご) with the verb 「なる」 (to become).
  Adding 「お」 or 「ご」 before a verb stem elevates the politeness level. Then 「〜になる」 indicates a change of
  state or action, but in this case, it is used to elevate the action itself to a more respectful level.
  This indirectness is a common strategy in polite expressions.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「お〜になる」 (or 「ご〜になる」) is used to express profound respect for the actions of someone of higher status than yourself. It is **never** used when talking about your own actions. The 「〜になる」 part functions similarly to 「する」, attaching to the ます-stem of a verb, thereby transforming a direct action into a state of 'becoming' that action, which lends an air of indirectness and thus, politeness.

  The choice between 「お」 and 「ご」 is crucial and generally depends on the origin of the verb's stem (訓読み - kun-yomi for 「お」, 音読み - on-yomi for 「ご」). However, there are exceptions, so careful attention to usage is advised.

  For instance, some verbs, like 「おいでになる」 (the 「お〜になる」 form of 「いる・来る・行く」), are almost exclusively used in honorific language. 「おいでになる」 can flexibly mean 'to come,' 'to go,' or 'to be,' depending on the context, signifying the speaker's respectful perspective toward the subject's movement or presence.

  - term: いらっしゃる
    meaning: To be (Honorific), To come (Honorific), To go (Honorific)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「いらっしゃる」 is an irregular honorific verb that directly replaces 「いる」, 「来る」, and 「行く」. In contrast,
      「お〜になる」 is a general pattern applicable to many verbs, where 「なる」 is appended to the verb stem after
      adding お/ご. While both convey honorific intent, 「いらっしゃる」 is a specific verb replacement, whereas
      「お〜になる」 is a productive construction.
    grammar_point: いらっしゃる (honorific forms)
  - term: なさる
    meaning: To do (Honorific)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「なさる」 is an irregular honorific verb that directly replaces 「する」 (to do). While 「お〜になる」 can
      also be used to make verbs honorific, it is a general construction, whereas 「なさる」 is specifically
      for 「する」. For example, 「お勉強になる」 (to respectfully study) vs. 「勉強なさる」 (to respectfully study). Both
      are honorific, but 「なさる」 is more idiomatic for 「する」.
    grammar_point: なさる (honorific verb)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'While 「いらっしゃる」 and 「なさる」 are specific honorific verbs that replace common
  verbs like 「いる/来る/行く」 and 「する」 respectively, 「お〜になる」 is a versatile grammatical pattern. This pattern
  can be applied to a wider range of verbs by attaching お or ご to their stem and then adding 「になる」. Understanding
  this distinction helps in choosing the most appropriate honorific expression: use the specific irregular
  honorific verbs when they apply, and 「お〜になる」 for other verbs to show respect for the subject''s actions.'

          for the teacher's actions.

          honorific form for someone of the president's status. We're seeking a more respectful request.

        english: I heard the professor has already read that book.
        hint: This sentence uses the plain past form of the verb, which is too direct when referring to
          a professor. We need an honorific expression for the professor's action of reading.

        hint: While polite, this simply states the action. We need to express respect for the Section

    japanese:
      - 社長 が お 怒り に {なら れ た} と 聞い て、私 たち は 皆 驚き まし た

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 社長 が 怒っ た と 聞い て、私 たち は 皆 驚き まし た
        english: Hearing that the president became angry, we were all surprised.
        hint: Using the plain form 「怒った」 (got angry) is too direct and lacks the respect required for
          someone of the president's high status, even when describing a negative emotion. We need to
          use an honorific form to show proper deference.
    scene: Employees discuss the president's unexpected anger.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: The use of 「お怒りになられた」 (a double honorific form for 「怒る」, combining 「お〜になる」 with the honorific
      passive 「〜られる」) emphasizes extreme respect, even when describing a negative emotion like anger.
      This is particularly fitting for a formal setting when speaking about someone of very high status
      like a company president. While 「お怒りになった」 is also correct, 「お怒りになられた」 adds an extra layer of formality
      and distance, often used when the speaker feels a great deal of deference or awe towards the person.
  - english: Please don't hesitate to eat if you wish, Madam.
    japanese:
      - 奥 様、どうぞ お 召し上がり に {なり ませ ん} か
      - 奥 様、どうぞ お 召し上がり に {なっ て ください}
      - 奥 様、どうぞ お 召し上がり に {なり ます} か

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 奥 様、どうぞ 召し上がっ て ください
        english: Madam, please eat.
        hint: While 「召し上がってください」 is polite, using the 「お〜になりませんか」 form creates a more indirect and therefore
          softer, more respectful invitation, common in formal hospitality. We're looking for a very deferential
          invitation.
    scene: A hostess offers food to a guest of honor during a formal dinner party.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「お召し上がりになりませんか」, combining the honorific verb 「召し上がる」 with the 「お〜になる」 pattern
      and a negative question, forms an extremely polite and indirect invitation. This is often used by
      someone in a service role or a hostess to a highly respected guest. The indirectness of 「なりませんか」
      softens the offer, making it sound less like a command and more like a gentle suggestion, showing
      utmost respect for the guest's autonomy.

        english: If the director prepares, I will check.
        hint: This simply states the action. We need to express respect for the director's action of preparing
          the documents. We're looking for an honorific conditional.

        english: I heard the CEO did not present at the conference yesterday.
        hint: This is a simple negative statement. We need to express respect even when saying that the
          CEO did not perform an action. We're looking for an honorific negative past.

post_example_writeup: Remember that the choice between 「お」 and 「ご」 depends on whether the verb is of Japanese
  or Chinese origin, respectively. While there are some exceptions, this is a good rule of thumb to follow.
  Also be mindful of the level of politeness you want to convey. This grammar point is quite polite, so
  use it when speaking to superiors, elders, or people you don't know well. The honorific form elevates
  the action of the subject, showing respect.
