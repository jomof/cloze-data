jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to express conjecture, probability, or to seek polite confirmation, implying the
    speaker has information supporting their belief.
  function: Expresses conjecture or probability, and seeks agreement or confirmation.
  nuance: Can convey high or low confidence depending on tone. 「だろう」 is more casual and can have a slightly
    more masculine nuance compared to 「でしょう」. 「でしょう」 implies the speaker has some information leading
    to their belief, but acknowledges uncertainty or seeks polite agreement from the listener.
  grammatical-role: Auxiliary verb to express conjecture or expectation.
  logical-flow: Expresses a logical conclusion or expectation.
  temporal-flow: Can be used for present, past, or future conjecture.
etymology: 「だろう」 is derived from the copula 「だ」, combined with the volitional auxiliary 「う」. Over time,
  it evolved from expressing intention to expressing conjecture or probability. The polite form 「でしょう」,
  stems from 「です」, which indicates a state of being or identity. The suffix 「しょう」 is added to 「です」 to
  express conjecture, intention, or invitation in a polite manner. Over time, 「ですしょう」 contracted into
  「でしょう」. Its historical origin as a combination of a declarative copula and a conjectural suffix explains
  its dual function of expressing both likelihood and a gentle query for confirmation.
writeup: |-
  「だろう」 and 「でしょう」 are both used to express the speaker's conjecture, probability, or uncertain assertion. They imply that the speaker thinks something is likely true but may lack definitive evidence. They are similar to saying "probably" or "isn't it?" in English. They can be used after verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and nouns.

  「だろう」 is generally considered more casual and can have a slightly more masculine nuance compared to 「でしょう」. While often used when the speaker has some information to support their assertion, it can also express a mere 'feeling' or 'hunch,' in which case it conveys low confidence, often indicated by the speaker's tone of voice.

  「でしょう」 is a polite expression used to express uncertainty, conjecture, or to seek confirmation from the listener. It's suitable for formal settings or when speaking to superiors or strangers. It indicates the speaker has some reason to believe what they are saying is true, but is not entirely certain. Consider it a polite way of making an assertion while inviting agreement.

  Generally, both follow the plain form of verbs and い-adjectives (present, past, negative). For な-adjectives and nouns, the plain form 「だ」 is often omitted before 「でしょう」 in polite speech, and the stem or noun is used directly. For example, 「静かでしょう」 (shizuka deshou) not 「静かだでしょう」 (shizuka da deshou). For 「だろう」, 「だ」 or 「だった」 is often inserted directly before 「だろう」 to create a grammatically correct sentence for な-adjectives and nouns, such as 「綺麗だろう」 (for a present state) or 「綺麗だったろう」 (for a past state).

  Although 「でしょう」 is polite, its usage varies depending on context. It's a versatile expression, suitable for making polite predictions, offering soft suggestions, or gently verifying information without being overly direct.
false_friends:
  - term: かもしれない
    meaning: Maybe, might
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「かもしれない」 expresses a lower degree of certainty compared to 「だろう・でしょう」. 「かもしれない」 suggests a
      possibility, while 「だろう・でしょう」 implies a higher likelihood or a more general assumption. This subtle
      distinction in certainty and shared assumption is key to differentiating them. In conversations,
      「かもしれない」 often implies the speaker is less certain, while 「だろう・でしょう」 imply a higher degree of confidence
      or an expectation that the listener will agree with the conjecture due to shared context or observation,
      often leading to a question like 'isn't it?' in English.
    grammar_point: かもしれない (might・maybe)
  - term: はずだ
    meaning: Should, ought to, expected to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「はずだ」 indicates a stronger expectation or reason than 「だろう・でしょう」. 「はずだ」 implies that there's
      a logical reason for something to be true, often based on concrete evidence or a rule. For example,
      「彼 は 来る はずだ」 (He should come/is expected to come) suggests certainty based on a schedule or previous
      arrangement. In contrast, 「彼 は 来る だろう」 (He will probably come) is more of a general conjecture without
      necessarily strong backing. 「はずだ」 conveys objective certainty (or high probability), while 「だろう・でしょう」
      are subjective conjectures. 「はずだ」 is often used when the speaker is confident in their deduction
      due to logical reasons or established facts, while 「だろう・でしょう」 are used when the speaker is making
      a general assumption, often based on less concrete evidence, or seeking agreement without asserting
      a strong conviction. The nuance of 「はずだ」 is one of strong expectation or logical conclusion, whereas
      「だろう・でしょう」 are more about prediction or seeking affirmation.
    grammar_point: '[Clause]はずだ・はずがない (is expected to be・cannot be)'
  - term: そうだ
    meaning: I heard that; it seems that
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「そうだ」 (hearsay) conveys information heard from someone else, whereas 「だろう・でしょう」 indicate the
      speaker's own conjecture. For example, 「雨 が 降る そうだ」 (I heard it will rain) reports information from
      a source, while 「雨 が 降る だろう」 (It will probably rain) is the speaker's own prediction. 「そうだ」 (appearance)
      expresses an impression based on visual information, unlike 「だろう・でしょう」 which are about likelihood.
      For example, 「おいし そうだ」 (It looks delicious) is based on appearance, whereas 「おいしい だろう」 (It's probably
      delicious) is a conjecture about taste. The key difference is that 「そうだ」 refers to information from
      an external source or direct sensory perception, while 「だろう・でしょう」 are the speaker's internal assessment
      of probability.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Sentence]そうだ (I heard・it is said)
  - term: じゃないか
    meaning: Isn't it?, Is it not?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「だろう・でしょう」, 「じゃないか」 implies a stronger assertion, often used when the speaker is confirming
      something they believe to be true or expressing slight surprise, expecting agreement. For example,
      「これ は いい じゃないか」 (This is good, isn't it? / This is good!) implies a stronger conviction or a slight
      discovery. 「じゃないか」 often carries a nuance of mild rhetorical question or confirmation of something
      obvious, sometimes with a slight reproach or emphasis. 「だろう・でしょう」 are generally softer, expressing
      a more tentative probability or seeking agreement without strong assertion. While both can seek
      agreement, 「じゃないか」 has a more assertive, almost accusatory or exclamatory tone, whereas 「だろう・でしょう」
      are more purely conjectural or gently seeking consensus.
    grammar_point: じゃないか (isn't it?)
  - term: ね (seeking agreement)
    meaning: Isn't it?, Right? (Sentence ending particle)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ね」 also seeks agreement, it primarily softens a statement or invites agreement on a
      shared understanding or known fact, whereas 「だろう・でしょう」 express the speaker's conjecture or probability.
      For example, 「寒い です ね」 (It's cold, isn't it?) assumes both parties are experiencing the cold. 「ね」
      confirms shared information or feelings, fostering empathy. In contrast, 「寒い だろう」 (It's probably
      cold) is a prediction or assumption. 「ね」 functions to ensure shared understanding and confirm existing
      facts or perceptions, while 「だろう・でしょう」 introduce new information in the form of a conjecture or
      seek agreement on something that is not yet a shared certainty. Therefore, 「ね」 is more about mutual
      affirmation, whereas 「だろう・でしょう」 are about expressing and inviting agreement on a probability.
    grammar_point: ね (seeking agreement)
  - term: のではないだろうか
    meaning: I think... isn't it?, It might be that..., Don't you agree?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is a more formal and indirect expression of conjecture or opinion than 「だろう・でしょう」. It
      softens the assertion and often implies a suggestion or invitation for discussion. For example,
      「これ は いい のではないだろうか」 (Don't you think this might be good?) is a polite and indirect way to suggest
      an idea. It adds a layer of politeness and tentativeness, making the speaker's opinion sound less
      direct and more open to consideration. It is often used in academic or business settings to propose
      an idea without sounding overly assertive, inviting constructive feedback. While 「だろう・でしょう」 are
      direct conjectures, 「のではないだろうか」 is a nuanced way to present a hypothesis or opinion, seeking polite
      agreement or discussion.
    grammar_point: のではないだろうか (indirect suggestion)
  - term: と思う
    meaning: I think or thought
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「と 思う」 expresses the speaker's personal opinion or belief, which can be based on evidence
      or simply a feeling. It's a direct statement of one's thoughts, regardless of whether the listener
      agrees. For example, 「美味しい と 思う」 (I think it's delicious) is a personal judgment. Unlike 「だろう・でしょう」,
      which conjecture about a general probability or seek agreement, 「と 思う」 is subjective and states
      what the speaker believes to be true. While 「だろう・でしょう」 imply a degree of shared understanding or
      expectation of agreement from the listener, 「と 思う」 is solely focused on the speaker's internal thought
      process. 「と 思う」 is about personal conviction, while 「だろう・でしょう」 are about shared probability or seeking
      consensus.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:思う (I think or thought)
  - term: です
    meaning: is/are
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「です」 states a fact. For instance, 「これ は リンゴ です」 (This is an apple) is a factual statement.
      In contrast, 「これ は リンゴ だろう」 (This is probably an apple) expresses uncertainty or conjecture. The
      key distinction is that 「です」 deals with established facts, while 「だろう・でしょう」 deal with probabilities
      and assumptions. Therefore, 「です」 is about conveying reality, whereas 「だろう・でしょう」 are about predicting
      or assuming reality.
    grammar_point: です (polite copula)
  - term: です ね
    meaning: is/are, isn't it?
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「です ね」 seeks agreement on a fact that is assumed to be known by both speaker and listener,
      implying more certainty than 「だろう・でしょう」 which express conjecture. For instance, 「これ は リンゴ です ね」
      (This is an apple, isn't it?) seeks confirmation on a known fact. In contrast, 「これ は リンゴ だろう」 (This
      is probably an apple) expresses uncertainty or conjecture. The key distinction is that 「です ね」 deals
      with shared understandings, while 「だろう・でしょう」 deal with probabilities and assumptions. Therefore,
      「です ね」 is about confirming reality, whereas 「だろう・でしょう」 are about predicting or assuming reality.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:です ね (confirmation of fact)
  - term: らしい
    meaning: It seems that..., It appears that...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「らしい」 indicates that information is based on what the speaker has heard or gathered from external
      sources, or from direct observation, leading to an inference. For example, 「彼 は 来る らしい」 (It seems
      he will come) implies information was obtained from someone else or deduced from circumstances.
      「らしい」 suggests indirect evidence. In contrast, 「だろう・でしょう」 are the speaker's own conjecture or probability,
      often without necessarily explicit external evidence, and can be more of a personal hunch. While
      both convey a degree of uncertainty, 「らしい」 points to an external basis for the inference, whereas
      「だろう・でしょう」 highlight the speaker's internal assessment of likelihood.
    grammar_point: らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)
  - term: です か
    meaning: Is it?, Are you? (polite question marker)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「です か」 forms a direct question seeking new information or explicit confirmation. 「でしょう」 implies
      the speaker already has some information or assumption and is seeking agreement, rather than a factual
      inquiry that requires a definitive yes/no answer. 「だろう」 as a question (with rising intonation) can
      also seek confirmation, but is more casual.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:です か (polite question marker)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing 「だろう・でしょう」 with similar expressions, remember that these
  forms indicate the speaker's conjecture or probability. 「だろう」 is casual, while 「でしょう」 is polite. 「かもしれない」
  expresses a lower possibility. 「はずだ」 implies a stronger expectation based on logic. 「そうだ」 relays information
  heard from others or describes an appearance, whereas 「らしい」 conveys information based on external cues
  or hearsay. 「じゃないか」 makes a stronger, often confirmatory assertion. 「ね」 and 「です ね」 soften a statement
  or invite agreement on a known fact. 「と 思う」 expresses a personal opinion. Lastly, 「です」 states facts
  or seeks agreement on known facts. Distinguishing between them often comes down to the source of information
  (internal conjecture vs. external evidence) and the degree of certainty the speaker wishes to convey.

    scene: Two friends recall a classic art-house film they watched, commenting on its subdued nature.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: A casual conjecture about a past state (a quiet film) between friends. The な-adjective 「静か」
      (shizuka) takes 「だった」 before 「だろう」 for past tense conjecture, indicating a shared, informal observation
      or deduction. The phrase 「静か だっ た だろう」 conveys a sense of agreement or understanding between the
      speakers about the film's nature, like "it was probably quiet, wasn't it?"
  - english: There was probably a test yesterday.
    japanese:
      - 昨日 テスト が あっ た {だろう}。
      - 昨日 テスト が あっ た {でしょう}。
    english_literally: Yesterday, test, there was, probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昨日 テスト が あっ た {はず だ}。
        english: There should have been a test yesterday (expected).
        hint: 「はずだ」 indicates a stronger, logical expectation about a past event. We're looking for a
          general conjecture based on observation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昨日 テスト が あっ た {か も しれ ない}。
        english: There might have been a test yesterday.
        hint: 「かもしれない」 indicates a lower degree of certainty about a past event. We're looking for a general
          probability.
    scene: A student sees their classmates looking tired and relieved, and deduces they had an exam.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: A casual deduction about a past event, using the plain past verb form 「あった」 (atta) for 'there
      was'. The lack of explicit information that the speaker relies on suggests a conjecture rather than
      certainty. 「テスト」 means 'test'. This is a common way for students to deduce events from circumstantial
      evidence, using 「あった だろう」 to express their probable conclusion.
  - english: The teacher will probably say so too.
    japanese:
      - 先生 も そう 言う {でしょう}。
      - 先生 も そう おっしゃる {でしょう}。
    english_literally: Teacher too, that way, say, will probably (polite).
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 も そう 言う {か も しれ ない}。
        english: The teacher might say so too.
        hint: 「かもしれない」 suggests a weaker possibility. We're looking for a more probable conjecture.
    scene: A student feels confident in their answer, expecting their teacher to confirm it later.
    register: formal
    setting: optimistic
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: A polite conjecture about what a person in authority (the teacher) will do, using the polite
      form 「でしょう」. The speaker is expressing an optimistic expectation that the teacher's opinion will
      align with theirs, using 「言う でしょう」 (iu deshou) for 'will probably say'. The alternative 「おっしゃる でしょう」
      (ossharu deshou) uses the honorific verb for 'to say', further elevating the respect for the teacher,
      common in a formal school setting.
  - english: This room is probably spacious, isn't it?
    japanese:
      - この 部屋 は 広い {でしょう}。
      - この 部屋 は 広い {だろう}。
    english_literally: This room, spacious, probably (polite).
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 部屋 は 広い {です ね}。
        english: This room is spacious, isn't it?
        hint: 「です ね」 confirms a known fact and seeks agreement. We're looking for a conjecture where the
          spaciousness is still an assumption.
    scene: A real estate agent shows a client a picture of an unfurnished room, inviting agreement on
      its size.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: persuasive
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: A semi-formal conjecture inviting agreement, suitable for a professional setting. 「広い」 (hiroi)
      means 'spacious', an い-adjective. The use of 「広い でしょう」 softens the statement, making it less of
      a direct assertion and more of an an invitation to agree, which is persuasive in a sales context.
      The implicit rising intonation makes it a question, seeking confirmation from the client.
  - english: The meeting was probably complicated.
    japanese:
      - 会議 は 複雑 だっ た {でしょう}。
      - 会議 は 複雑 だっ た {だろう}。
    english_literally: Meeting, complicated, was, probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会議 は 複雑 だっ た {はず だ}。
        english: The meeting should have been complicated (expected).
        hint: 「はずだ」 implies a stronger, logical expectation about a past state. We're looking for a general
          conjecture.
    scene: Two coworkers are speculating about a difficult meeting their boss just had.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: This formal conjecture expresses an assumption about a past state (complexity of a meeting).
      The use of 「複雑 だっ た でしょう」 (fukuzatsu datta deshou) makes it polite and appropriate for a professional
      setting. The な-adjective 「複雑」 (fukuzatsu) takes 「だった」 before 「でしょう」 for past tense, reflecting a
      shared understanding of the situation's likely difficulty among colleagues.
  - english: You probably already know.
    japanese:
      - もう ご 存知 {でしょう}。
      - もう 知っ てる {だろう}。
    english_literally: Already, knowing/aware, probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - もう ご 存知 {か も しれ ない}。
        english: You might already know.
        hint: 「かもしれない」 indicates a lower degree of certainty. We're looking for a polite conjecture with
          a higher probability.
    scene: A senior colleague subtly hints to a junior colleague that they should already be aware of
      something.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of the honorific prefix 「ご」 in 「ご存知」 (go-zonji) and polite form 「でしょう」 makes this
      suitable for a senior male addressing a junior female colleague politely but firmly. This is a polite
      way of expressing a strong assumption that the listener already knows, often used to prompt a response
      or confirm shared knowledge. The phrase 「もう ご存知 でしょう」 implies a subtle expectation for the listener
      to be informed without directly asking.
  - english: That was probably the principal, wasn't it?
    japanese:
      - あの 人 は 校長 だっ た {だろう}。
      - あの 人 は 校長 だっ た {でしょう}。
    english_literally: That person, principal, was, probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 人 は 校長 だっ た {か も しれ ない}。
        english: That person might have been the principal.
        hint: 「かもしれない」 indicates a lower degree of certainty. We're looking for a casual conjecture with
          higher probability about someone's past identity.
    scene: Two students are walking home and see someone they vaguely recognize leaving the school grounds.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: This is a casual, slightly speculative question between friends about someone's past identity,
      using 「校長 だっ た だろう」. The use of 「だった」 marks the past tense for the noun 「校長」 (kouchou, principal)
      before adding 「だろう」. It carries a nuance of seeking confirmation for a strong guess rather than
      stating a definite fact.
  - english: The bus probably already left.
    japanese:
      - バス は もう 出 た {だろう}。
      - バス は もう 出 た {でしょう}。
    english_literally: Bus, already, left, probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - バス は もう 出 た {か も しれ ない}。
        english: The bus might have already left.
        hint: 「かもしれない」 suggests a weaker possibility. We're looking for a stronger likelihood of the event
          having occurred.
    scene: A person arrives at a bus stop a little late and sees no bus in sight.
    register: casual
    setting: pessimistic
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: A casual, slightly pessimistic conjecture about a past event, using the plain past form of
      the verb 「出 た」 (deta, left) combined with 「だろう」. The speaker, upon seeing no bus, concludes that
      it's highly probable the bus has already departed. The phrase 「もう 出 た だろう」 expresses a resigned
      assumption about the situation.
  - english: It's a holiday today, isn't it?
    japanese:
      - 今日 は 休み {でしょう}？
      - 今日 は 休み {でしょう} か？
      - 今日 は 休み {でしょう} ね？
      - 今日、休み {でしょう} か。
      - 今日 は 休み {でしょう}。
      - 今日 は 休み {でしょう} ね。
      - 今日 は お 休み {でしょう}？
    english_literally: Today is holiday, probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 休み {です か}。
        english: Is today a holiday?
        hint: The scene of a colleague checking the schedule for confirmation, rather than a direct inquiry,
          makes this grammar point more appropriate, as it gently probes for agreement with a mild assumption,
          unlike the more direct form. We're looking for a polite confirmation with an assumed fact.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 休み {だろう} か。
        english: I wonder if today is a holiday.
        hint: This form also expresses conjecture but is more common in casual settings, whereas the target
          grammar point is polite. We're looking for a polite confirmation with an assumed fact.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 休み {だろう}？
        english: It's a holiday today, right?
        hint: 「だろう」 is the casual form of でしょう. While it also seeks confirmation, the scene implies a
          polite professional context, making でしょう more appropriate. We're looking for a polite confirmation
          with an assumed fact.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 休み {じゃ ない か}。
        english: It's a holiday today, isn't it!
        hint: 「じゃないか」 conveys a stronger, sometimes challenging tone, asserting the speaker's belief,
          which doesn't fit the neutral, informative tone needed for a colleague checking a schedule.
          We're looking for a polite confirmation with an assumed fact.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 休み です {ね}。
        english: It's a holiday today, isn't it?
        hint: While 「ですね」 also seeks agreement, でしょう implies a slight uncertainty or a degree of conjecture,
          which fits better when you are checking an assumption with someone. We're looking for a polite
          confirmation with an assumed fact.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 休み {か も しれ ませ ん}。
        english: Today might be a holiday.
        hint: 「かもしれません」 expresses a weaker possibility. The scene suggests the speaker has some basis
          for their assumption, making でしょう (probably) more fitting than a mere 'might be'. We're looking
          for a polite confirmation with an assumed fact.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 休み {です}。
        english: Today is a holiday.
        hint: 「です」 states a fact definitively. The scene requires a nuance of seeking confirmation or
          expressing a likelihood, rather than a certain statement. We're looking for a polite confirmation
          with an assumed fact.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 休み な の で は {ない でしょう か}。
        english: Isn't it that today is a holiday?
        hint: This is a more formal and indirect way to express conjecture or question a possibility,
          whereas でしょう is more direct for polite confirmation. We're looking for a polite confirmation
          with an assumed fact.
    scene: A busy colleague checking the schedule with another.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「でしょう？」 is used here to politely confirm an assumed fact, common in workplace conversations.
      The use of 「今日」 (today) and 「休み」 (holiday) are N5-level vocabulary. 「でしょう」 in this context allows
      the speaker to express an assumption while still being polite and allowing for correction if their
      assumption is wrong. This is particularly useful in a professional environment when you want to
      avoid sounding too assertive or making a mistake. The interrogative 「か」 or the particle 「ね」 can
      be added to soften the inquiry or seek specific agreement, but the core meaning of polite conjecture
      remains.
    etymology: The etymology of 「でしょう」 as a contraction of 「です」 and 「しょう」 highlights its polite conjectural
      nature. The inclusion of 「休み」 before 「でしょう」 indicates a noun followed by the conjectural ending,
      fitting the formation rules for nouns.
  - english: He'll probably arrive around three.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 三 時 ごろ に 着く {でしょう}。
      - 彼 は 三 時 ごろ に 着く {でしょう} ね。
      - 彼 は 三 時 ごろ に 着く {でしょう} か。
    english_literally: He around 3 o'clock arrive probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 三 時 ごろ に 着く {だろう}。
        english: He'll probably arrive around three (casual).
        hint: While both express conjecture, this uses the plain form 「だろう」 which is less polite and suitable
          for casual conversation, unlike the formal setting implied. We're looking for a polite conjecture.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 三 時 ごろ に 着く {か も しれ ませ ん}。
        english: He might arrive around three.
        hint: 「かもしれません」 indicates a possibility with less certainty than でしょう, which implies a higher
          likelihood based on some information. We're looking for a polite conjecture with higher certainty.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 三 時 ごろ に 着く {はず です}。
        english: He should arrive around three (expected).
        hint: 「はずです」 suggests a stronger expectation or certainty, often based on a plan or established
          fact, whereas でしょう indicates a more general probability or assumption. We're looking for a polite
          conjecture.
    scene: Two colleagues discussing a client's arrival time.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「着く でしょう」 uses the plain form of the verb 「着く」 (tsuku) followed by でしょう, demonstrating how
      verbs attach to this structure. The phrase 「三 時 ごろ」 (sanji goro) indicates 'around three o'clock',
      a common adverbial phrase. The use of 「でしょう」 here makes the prediction polite and less assertive,
      suitable for a professional setting where one might not have definitive information but still wants
      to convey an informed expectation.
  - english: This cake must be delicious, don't you think?
    japanese:
      - この ケーキ は おいしい {でしょう}？
      - この ケーキ は おいしい {でしょう} ね。
      - この ケーキ は おいしい {でしょう} か。
    english_literally: This cake is delicious, probably?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この ケーキ は おいしい {だろう}？
        english: This cake is probably delicious (casual).
        hint: The use of 「だろう」 would make this a casual inquiry, which doesn't fit the semi-formal setting
          of a tea party among acquaintances. We're looking for a polite confirmation/conjecture.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この ケーキ は おいし {そう} です ね。
        english: This cake looks delicious, doesn't it?
        hint: 「そう」 describes an appearance, whereas でしょう expresses a conjecture about an inherent quality
          or current state. The speaker is conjecturing about the actual taste, not just the appearance.
          We're looking for a polite conjecture about taste.
    scene: At a tea party, one guest compliments a homemade cake.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「おいしい でしょう？」 connects the plain form of an い-adjective, 「おいしい」 (oishii), with でしょう. The question
      mark indicates a soft query for agreement, typical in polite social situations when expressing an
      opinion or observation. This usage is common when a speaker feels confident in their observation
      but wants to invite the listener to concur, fostering a friendly atmosphere.
  - english: The new cafe will probably be quiet.
    japanese:
      - 新しい カフェ は 静か {でしょう}。
      - 新しい カフェ は 静か {でしょう} ね。
      - 新しい カフェ は 静か {でしょう} か。
    english_literally: New cafe is quiet, probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新しい カフェ は 静か {だろう}。
        english: The new cafe will probably be quiet (casual).
        hint: This uses the casual form 「だろう」, which would be inappropriate for a conversation with a
          senior. We're looking for a polite conjecture.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新しい カフェ は 静か {です か も しれ ませ ん}。
        english: The new cafe might be quiet.
        hint: While also conjecture, 「かもしれません」 implies less certainty, whereas でしょう is used for a more
          probable prediction based on current information. We're looking for a polite conjecture with
          higher certainty.
    scene: A junior employee discusses local spots with their senior at work.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: Here, 「静かでしょう」 shows the usage with a な-adjective stem 「静か」 (shizuka). Unlike い-adjectives,
      the な-adjective simply drops the だ and connects directly to でしょう. This polite conjecture about the
      cafe's atmosphere is typical in conversations where one offers an informed opinion to a superior,
      maintaining politeness while sharing insight.
  - english: That person must be the new manager, right?
    japanese:
      - あの 人 が 新しい 部長 {でしょう}？
      - あの 人 が 新しい 部長 {でしょう} ね？
      - あの 人 が 新しい 部長 {でしょう} か。
    english_literally: That person is new manager, probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 人 が 新しい 部長 {です か}？
        english: Is that person the new manager?
        hint: 「です か」 is a direct question, seeking factual information, while 「でしょう」 implies a speaker's
          assumption seeking confirmation. The scene suggests an observation that needs gentle confirmation,
          not a blank inquiry. We're looking for a polite confirmation of an assumption.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 人 が 新しい 部長 {だろう}？
        english: That person is probably the new manager, right? (casual)
        hint: This uses the casual form 「だろう」 which is unsuitable for a formal office setting. We're looking
          for a polite confirmation of an assumption.
    scene: Two employees observe a new face in the office.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「部長でしょう？」 illustrates the use of でしょう with a noun, 「部長」 (buchou, manager). Similar to な-adjectives,
      nouns directly precede でしょう in polite conjecture. This sentence is a polite way to confirm an identity
      based on observation, allowing the listener to easily affirm or correct without awkwardness.
  - english: It must have been cold yesterday.
    japanese:
      - 昨日 は 寒かっ た {でしょう}。
      - 昨日 は 寒かっ た {でしょう} ね。
      - 昨日 は 寒かっ た {でしょう} か。
    english_literally: Yesterday was cold, probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昨日 は 寒かっ た {と 思い ます}。
        english: I think it was cold yesterday.
        hint: 「と 思います」 expresses a personal opinion, whereas 「でしょう」 here is a conjecture based on observable
          facts (like frost), inviting agreement rather than just stating a thought. We're looking for
          a polite conjecture based on evidence.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昨日 は 寒かっ た {そう} です ね。
        english: I heard it was cold yesterday, right?
        hint: 「そう です」 indicates hearsay, meaning the speaker heard it from someone else, but the scene
          implies the speaker observed evidence themselves. We're looking for a polite conjecture based
          on evidence.
    scene: A neighbor remarks on the morning frost to another.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「寒かったでしょう」 demonstrates でしょう used with the past tense of an い-adjective, 「寒かった」 (samukatta).
      This allows for polite conjecture about past states. The nuance here is a gentle observation and
      invitation for agreement, often used among acquaintances or neighbors, making conversation flow
      smoothly.
  - english: She's probably serious about her studies.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 勉強 に 真剣 {でしょう}。
      - 彼女 は 勉強 に 真剣 {でしょう} ね。
      - 彼女 は 勉強 に 真剣 {でしょう} か。
    english_literally: She towards studies serious, probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 勉強 に 真剣 {そう} です。
        english: She looks serious about her studies.
        hint: 「そう です」 describes appearance, while 「でしょう」 here conjectures about an internal state (seriousness)
          based on observations, suggesting a higher degree of inference. We're looking for a polite conjecture
          about an internal state.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 勉強 に 真剣 だ {と 思い ます}。
        english: I think she is serious about her studies.
        hint: 「と 思います」 is a direct personal opinion. 「でしょう」 offers that opinion as a conjecture, seeking
          gentle affirmation or allowing for difference of opinion without being confrontational. We're
          looking for a polite conjecture.
    scene: A teacher comments on a diligent student's attitude to a colleague.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「真剣でしょう」 combines a な-adjective stem 「真剣」 (shinken) with でしょう to form a polite conjecture
      about someone's internal characteristic. In an academic setting, this allows for a professional
      yet gentle way of discussing students, implying an informed observation without stating it as an
      absolute fact. The politeness of でしょう respects the colleague's own observations.
  - english: That's probably what he meant.
    japanese:
      - それ が 彼 の 言い たかっ た こと {でしょう}。
      - それ が 彼 の 言い たかっ た こと {でしょう} ね。
      - それ が 彼 の 言い たかっ た こと {でしょう} か。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - それ が 彼 の 言い たかっ た こと だ {と 思い ます}。
        english: I think that's what he meant.
        hint: While similar, 「と 思います」 is a more direct statement of personal thought. 「でしょう」 softens it
          into a conjecture, which is more suitable for a group discussion where different interpretations
          are possible. We're looking for a polite conjecture.
      - competing_japanese:
          - それ が 彼 の 言い たかっ た こと {か な}。
        english: I wonder if that's what he meant.
        hint: 「かな」 expresses more personal doubt and is casual, whereas 「でしょう」 maintains politeness and
          invites general agreement from the group. We're looking for a polite conjecture suitable for
          a group discussion.
    scene: During a group discussion, clarifying a previous speaker's unclear statement.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「ことでしょう」 uses でしょう after a nominalized phrase, 「言いたかった こと」 (iitakatta koto, what he wanted
      to say). This structure allows for polite conjecture about abstract concepts or past intentions.
      In a group setting, using でしょう maintains a cooperative atmosphere, inviting others to consider the
      interpretation without imposing it as fact. The phrase 「それ が」 (sore ga) highlights the specific
      interpretation being offered.
  - english: You must be tired, aren't you?
    japanese:
      - お 疲れ {でしょう}？
      - お 疲れ {でしょう} ね？
      - お 疲れ {でしょう} か。
    english_literally: Tired, probably?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - お 疲れ {です か}？
        english: Are you tired?
        hint: A direct question 「です か」 can sound abrupt or accusatory. 「でしょう」 expresses empathy by first
          assuming tiredness, then gently seeking confirmation, making it more thoughtful. We're looking
          for an empathetic conjecture.
      - competing_japanese:
          - お 疲れ だ {と 思い ます}。
        english: I think you are tired.
        hint: Stating 「と 思います」 as a personal thought is less engaging than でしょう, which subtly invites
          the listener to agree or offer more information about their state. We're looking for an empathetic
          conjecture.
    scene: Greeting a family member returning home after a long day.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: supportive
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「お 疲れ でしょう？」 is a very common and empathetic use of でしょう, often functioning as a greeting.
      「お 疲れ」 (otsukare) is a polite expression for 'tiredness' or 'hard work'. When combined with でしょう,
      it forms a soft, considerate inquiry, showing concern while assuming the listener's state, making
      it a very warm and polite expression typically used among family or colleagues. The absence of an
      explicit subject like 「あなた」 (anata) is natural in Japanese when the subject is clear from context.
  - english: This project will surely succeed, won't it?
    japanese:
      - この プロジェクト は きっと 成功 する {でしょう}。
      - この プロジェクト は きっと 成功 する {でしょう} ね。
      - この プロジェクト は きっと 成功 する {でしょう} か。
    english_literally: This project certainly succeed, probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この プロジェクト は きっと 成功 する {はず です}。
        english: This project is supposed to succeed (strong expectation).
        hint: 「はず です」 implies an expectation based on a known plan or reason, whereas でしょう can convey
          a more hopeful or confident prediction without necessarily relying on explicit justification.
          We're looking for a polite, confident conjecture.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この プロジェクト は きっと 成功 する {と 思い ます}。
        english: I think this project will certainly succeed.
        hint: 「と 思います」 is a statement of personal belief. 「でしょう」, especially with 「きっと」, projects that
          belief as a strong likelihood, gently inviting shared optimism rather than simply stating an
          opinion. We're looking for a polite, confident conjecture.
    scene: A team leader reassures their team about a challenging new project.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: inspirational
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「成功 する でしょう」 combines the plain form of the verb 「成功 する」 (seikou suru, to succeed) with でしょう.
      The adverb 「きっと」 (kitto, surely/certainly) strengthens the conjecture, implying a high degree of
      confidence. This usage is common when expressing hopeful predictions or offering encouragement,
      balancing a strong assertion with polite deference to the listener's perspective, which is important
      in leadership.
  - english: Tomorrow's weather will probably be sunny, right?
    japanese:
      - 明日 の 天気 は 晴れ {でしょう}？
      - 明日 の 天気 は 晴れ {でしょう} ね？
      - 明日 の 天気 は 晴れ {でしょう} か。
    english_literally: Tomorrow's weather is sunny, probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 の 天気 は 晴れる {だろう} か。
        english: I wonder if tomorrow's weather will be sunny (casual).
        hint: While similar in meaning, this uses the plain form 「だろう か」 which is more suitable for casual
          self-reflection or a very informal query, not for a polite conversation with an acquaintance.
          We're looking for a polite confirmation/conjecture.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 の 天気 は 晴れる と 予想 {さ れ ます}。
        english: Tomorrow's weather is predicted to be sunny.
        hint: This is a statement of official prediction, using the passive voice. 「でしょう」 is a more personal,
          polite conjecture often used in casual conversation among friends or neighbors, not a formal
          report. We're looking for a polite conjecture.
    scene: Two neighbors chat about the weather forecast.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「晴れ でしょう？」 combines the noun 「晴れ」 (hare, sunny weather) with でしょう. This is a common way to
      make a polite conjecture about future events, especially weather. The nuance is a light, conversational
      query, inviting the other person to share their knowledge or agreement, fitting for a relaxed exchange
      between neighbors. The use of 「明日 の 天気」 (ashita no tenki) clearly sets the topic as 'tomorrow's
      weather'.
post_example_writeup: The choice between 「だろう」 and 「でしょう」 largely depends on the level of politeness required
  by the context. 「だろう」 is suitable for casual conversations with friends and family, while 「でしょう」 is
  more appropriate in formal settings or when speaking to superiors or strangers. While 「だろう」 can sound
  assertive or masculine, its usage as a simple conjecture is widespread across genders in casual contexts.
  The variations in formation allow for different degrees of certainty and politeness. While でしょう always
  carries a polite tone, the context and the speaker's intention determine whether it's a polite conjecture
  or a gentle request for confirmation. Pay attention to the preceding word's form (plain verb/い-adjective,
  or stem for な-adjective/noun) to grasp the exact nuance and ensure correct usage.
