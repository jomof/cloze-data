    "etymology": "たて comes from the verb 立てる (たてる, \"to stand\" or \"to set up\"). The suffix retains a sense of immediacy, indicating that something has just been completed, often implying it's at its freshest or optimal state.",
    "writeup": "たて, originating from the verb 立てる (tateru, \"to stand\" or \"to set up\"), functions as a suffix in Japanese, typically attached to the masu-stem (conjunctive form) of verbs. It conveys that something has \"just been finished\" or is \"freshly finished\". As a suffix, たて transforms verbs into nouns. Consequently, it can be followed by the particle の and a noun to modify it. This suffix emphasizes the moment immediately after an action's completion, rather than merely stating that the action is finished. Therefore, たて is often used with verbs where the quality or characteristic implied by the action degrades over time after completion, such as freshly cooked food or newly picked produce. It highlights the pristine, peak state right after the action.",

To avoid confusion, consider if the freshness or immediate consequence of the action is the key emphasis; if so, たて is likely the best choice.",
