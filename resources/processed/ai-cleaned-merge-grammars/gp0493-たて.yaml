        "grammatical-role": "adjectival"
    },
    "etymology": "たて comes from the verb 立てる (たてる, \"to stand\" or \"to set up\"). The suffix retains a sense of immediacy, indicating that something has just been completed, often implying it's at its freshest or optimal state. This origin suggests a sense of something being 'set up' or 'established' in its perfect, initial condition.",
    "writeup": "たて, originating from the verb 立てる (tateru, \"to stand\" or \"to set up\"), functions as a suffix in Japanese, typically attached to the masu-stem (conjunctive form) of verbs. It conveys that something has \"just been finished\" or is \"freshly finished\". As a suffix, たて transforms verbs into nouns. Consequently, it can be followed by the particle の and a noun to modify it, such as 「焼き立てのパン」 (freshly baked bread). This suffix emphasizes the moment immediately after an action's completion, rather than merely stating that the action is finished. Therefore, たて is often used with verbs where the quality or characteristic implied by the action degrades over time after completion, such as freshly cooked food or newly picked produce. It highlights the pristine, peak state right after the action, emphasizing its optimal condition or a transient characteristic directly resulting from the recent action.",

            "nuance": "Unlike たて, かけ indicates that something is in the process of being done or has just begun but is not yet complete. For example, 読みかけの本 (a book I'm halfway through reading) suggests an unfinished state.",

            "nuance": "たところだ is similar to たて in conveying recent completion but is a full grammatical construction rather than a suffix. It describes actions that just finished and their direct effects. It emphasizes the recency of the action more broadly, while たて often implies a state of freshness or immediacy related to the item itself.",

            "nuance": "たばかり also emphasizes the newness or recency of a situation or item, similar to たところだ.

        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While たて, たところだ, and たばかり all express recent completion, remember that たて is a suffix that often highlights the peak quality or immediate state following an action, especially for things that are consumed or used immediately after being made (like food or newly sharpened pencils). たところだ and たばかり are broader expressions of 'just did' or 'just happened', without necessarily carrying the nuance of a transient, optimal state. To avoid confusion, consider if the freshness or immediate consequence of the action is the key emphasis; if so, たて is likely the best choice.",
