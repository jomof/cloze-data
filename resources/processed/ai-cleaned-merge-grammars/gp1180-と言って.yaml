    "writeup": "**と言って** (to itte) functions as a conjunction similar to \"however,\" \"but,\" or \"having said that.\" It's used to introduce a contrasting or qualifying statement, acknowledging the previous statement while presenting a different perspective or limitation. This grammar point is often found in more formal or written contexts. It sets up a contrasting idea, often implying that the speaker recognizes the initial point but wants to introduce a different consideration. It acts as a bridge between two related but opposing ideas, creating a nuanced and balanced perspective.",
    "etymology": "The phrase **と言って** comes from the verb **言う** (iu), meaning \"to say.\" The **て** form connects the verb to the following statement, creating the sense of \"having said that\" or \"speaking of which,\" which then introduces the contrast.",

The listener is the date so the speaker tries to soften the blow by saying that she has to leave 「今日はもう遅いから帰らないと」which means 'it's late, so I have to go home.'",
            "etymology": "「一緒」is a combination of the kanji 一(one) and 緒(thread). 「帰る」is a word with ancient roots, originally meaning to return to one's origin or source."
