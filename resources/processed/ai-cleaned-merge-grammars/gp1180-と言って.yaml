        "Register": "Primarily used in writing and formal speech.",
        "Function": "Introduces a contrasting point or a reservation about the preceding statement."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「と言って」 comes from the verb 「言う」 (iu), meaning \"to say.\" In this context, it literally means \"having said that,\" and it functions as a conjunction to introduce a contrasting thought or reservation.",
    "writeup": "「と言って」 is a conjunction used to introduce a contrasting or qualifying statement, similar to \"however\" or \"but.\" It acknowledges the preceding statement but presents an opposing or limiting perspective. It's more formal and literary than casual alternatives like 「でも」. It's often used to express a reservation or to soften a potentially contradictory statement. It implies that despite what was said before, there's another aspect to consider.",

                    "mitigation": "This scenario highlights a thoughtful reservation after stating a desire. 「と言って」 introduces a more nuanced counterpoint than a simple 「しかし」 (but), which might sound too abrupt in a reflective discussion."

            "etymology": "「当て」 (ate) is derived from the verb 「当てる」 (ateru), meaning 'to hit' or 'to apply.' In this context, it refers to a prospect or a reliable source."

                    "mitigation": "This scenario highlights an internal conflict where a simple 「しかし」 would not capture the self-reflection. 「と言って」 emphasizes the speaker's recognition of the impracticality of their initial thought or feeling, making it suitable for a monologue or self-talk."

            "nuance": "This phrase describes a common personal dilemma, where the speaker is weighing options. The use of 「億劫だ」 (okkū da, troublesome) highlights a personal feeling often expressed by women in casual self-talk.",
            "etymology": "「億劫」 (okkū) originates from a Buddhist term referring to an incredibly long period of time (a kalpa), implying something that feels like it takes an immense, troublesome effort."

                    "mitigation": "This illustrates a strategic dilemma, where the speaker is presenting a counterpoint to inaction. Using 「しかし」 might sound too blunt or like a simple fact, whereas 「と言って」 conveys a deeper sense of consideration for the difficult choice being presented to the team."

            "etymology": "「名案」 (meian) is composed of 「名」 (mei, excellent) and 「案」 (an, idea). 「悪化」 (akka) combines 「悪」 (aku, bad) and 「化」 (ka, change/become), meaning 'deterioration' or 'worsening'."

This kind of confessional statement, revealing a deeply personal dilemma, is commonly expressed among close male friends. The use of 「勇気もない」 (yūki mo nai, no courage either) emphasizes the speaker's helplessness.",
            "etymology": "「離婚」 (rikon) consists of 「離」 (ri, to separate) and 「婚」 (kon, marriage). 「勇気」 (yūki) is formed from 「勇」 (yū, courage) and 「気」 (ki, spirit/energy)."
