        "part-of-speech": "conjunction",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Used in formal or reflective contexts to introduce a nuance of 'despite what was just said', often when acknowledging a point before introducing a counterpoint or limitation.",
        "function": "Introduces a contrasting point or a reservation about the preceding statement.",
        "nuance": "Implies a subtle acknowledgment of the preceding statement before introducing a counterpoint or limitation, often used to soften contradictions or express a dilemma.",
        "source": "DOJG",
        "colocation": "Often precedes a statement that acknowledges a previous point but then introduces a limitation or an opposing reality.",
        "grammatical-role": "Connects two sentences, with the latter presenting a counterpoint or reservation to the former.",
        "logical-flow": "Creates a flow where an initial statement is presented, and then a contrasting or limiting perspective is introduced.",
        "temporal-flow": "The contrasting statement immediately follows the initial statement, with no significant temporal gap implied."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「と言って」 comes from the verb 「言う」(iu), meaning \"to say.\" In this context, it literally means \"having said that,\" and it functions as a conjunction to introduce a contrasting thought or reservation. This grammatical function evolved from the literal meaning of someone having just stated something, followed by a contrasting remark.",
    "writeup": "「と言って」 is a conjunction employed to introduce a contrasting or qualifying statement, functioning similarly to \"however\" or \"but.\" It acknowledges the preceding statement but then presents an opposing or limiting perspective. This construction is more formal and literary compared to casual alternatives such as 「でも」 or 「けれど」. It is frequently used to express a reservation or to soften a potentially contradictory statement. The nuance implied is that despite what was said immediately before, there is another aspect or reality that must be considered. This often creates a sense of internal deliberation or a careful qualification of a given situation, making it suitable for nuanced discussions or arguments, especially in written form or formal speech.",

                    "mitigation": "While 'しかし' directly introduces a contrast, 'と言って' implies a more nuanced internal consideration or dilemma before presenting the contrasting point, which is suitable for a leader explaining a complex situation to a team, acknowledging difficulty while upholding standards."

            "nuance": "The phrase 「納期 が 短い」 (the deadline is short) presents a challenging reality. The subsequent statement 「品質 を 下げる わけ には いかない」 (we cannot compromise on quality) demonstrates a firm commitment to standards despite the initial constraint. This usage of 「と言って」 highlights a necessary choice in a difficult situation."

                    "mitigation": "'けれど' offers a direct contradiction. 'と言って' is more suited for a reflective context, where the speaker acknowledges one truth ('自信 は ついた') before presenting a nuanced, often emotional, counter-reality ('ホームシック に ならない わけでは ない') that exists simultaneously, fitting for personal journaling."

The follow-up 「ホームシック に ならない わけでは ない」 (it's not as if I don't get homesick) adds a layer of emotional complexity, indicating that despite the positive, a negative feeling persists. This subtle admission makes the nuance of 「と言って」 appropriate here."

                    "mitigation": "'けど' is common for simple contrasts. However, 'と言って' implies a more significant logical constraint or a choice to be made despite the positive, emphasizing that the positive aspect does not negate the problem of high rent, which is more fitting for a serious discussion of a practical issue."
