jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: general
  function: Points to something near the listener or within their shared context.
  grammatical-role: Pre-noun adjectival, modifying a noun.
etymology: 「その」 (sono) is a demonstrative belonging to the 'Ko-So-A-Do' system. The 'so' element indicates
  something associated with the listener, either physically near them or within their realm of knowledge
  or experience. Historically, it derives from the Old Japanese demonstrative 'そ' (so) combined with the
  genitive particle 'の' (no), functioning as a pre-noun adjectival to modify a noun, akin to 'that of'
  or 'that belonging to'.
writeup: 「その」 (sono) is classified as a pre-noun adjectival (連体詞, rentaishi) in Japanese. These words
  are unique because they do not conjugate, meaning their form always remains the same regardless of tense,
  mood, or politeness level. 「その」 always precedes a noun, directly modifying it.Its primary function is
  to refer to a noun that is either physically located near the listener, or that is part of the listener's
  immediate context or shared knowledge. While it translates to 'that' in English, its usage is distinct
  from 'this' (この, kono) or 'that over there' (あの, ano), which indicate proximity to the speaker or distance
  from both, respectively.Consider 「その」 when you are pointing to an object that is closer to the person
  you are speaking to, or when referring to a topic, idea, or situation that has just been discussed and
  is now 'with' the listener.

post_false_friends_writeup: Remember that 「その」 is used to point out something close to the listener or
  related to their immediate context. When you want to indicate something closer to yourself, use 「この」.
  If you want to refer to something further away from both of you, use 「あの」. These are parts of the 'Ko-So-A-Do'
  system of demonstratives, and choosing the correct one depends on the relative proximity of the object
  or concept to the speaker and listener.

    nuance: The use of 「その」 (sono) is appropriate because the restaurant is likely a topic that the listener

      The polite 「です か」 (desu ka) form is suitable for a formal conversation, maintaining politeness between
      individuals. In this context, it shows polite curiosity about something relevant to the listener's
      plans or recent experience.

    scene: A younger colleague just presented a new idea during a team meeting, and their older manager
      offers a compliment.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: supportive
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「その アイデア」 (sono idea) is natural because the idea has just been presented by the
      listener, making it part of their immediate context. The phrase 「素晴らしい です ね」 (subarashii desu ne)
      with 「ね」 (ne) softens the compliment, making it more approachable, especially from an older manager
      to a younger team member, fostering a positive atmosphere without being overly stiff. The casual
      「最高 っす ね！」 (saikou ssu ne!) with 「っす」 (ssu) is a more informal, sometimes male, enthusiastic expression
      often used among peers or in less formal business settings, while 「グッド だ ね！」 (good da ne!) is casual
      and often used among friends, incorporating a loanword.

    nuance: The casual 「ね」 (ne) ending is typical in friendly conversation between close female friends,
      seeking mild agreement. The phrase 「とても かわいい」 (totemo kawaii) is a common, endearing expression.
      「その 犬」 (sono inu) is natural because the dog is either with or near the listener. 「ワン ちゃん」 (wan
      chan) is an affectionate term for a dog, often used by women or when speaking to children, and 「超
      かわいい じゃ ん！」 (chou kawaii jan!) and 「まじ かわいい ん だ けど！」 (maji kawaii n dakedo!) are very casual, youthful
      slang expressions, particularly common among younger women.
