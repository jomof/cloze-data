etymology: 「けれど」 is a contracted form of 「けれども」. Historically, 「けれども」 combines the izennkei (realis/conditional
  form) of the classical auxiliary verb 「けり」 (which signified 'discovery' or 'confirmation of a past event')
  and the conjunctive particle 「ども」 (meaning 'although' or 'even if'). This original meaning of concession
  or unexpected reality evolved over time to its current function as a general conjunction for 'but' or
  'however', connecting contrasting ideas or clauses.
writeup: |-
  「けれど」 is a conjunction in Japanese that means "but," "however," or "although." It is one of the most common ways to connect two contrasting or concessive clauses.

  It is generally considered a softer and more polite way to express contrast compared to 「が」 when connecting clauses, and it can also introduce a new topic or provide additional information without necessarily implying a strong contradiction.

  While 「けれど」 can be used in both formal and casual settings, its slightly longer form 「けれども」 is considered more formal and literary. In very casual speech, it often shortens to 「けど」 or 「けども」.

  It's versatile and can follow plain forms of verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives (using their 「だ」 form), and nouns (using their 「だ」 form).

  The primary function of 「けれど」 is to link two statements where the second statement presents a contrast, a reservation, or a consequence that might seem unexpected given the first statement. It can also simply introduce background information or lead into a question or request.

  - term: '<suggest>: が (conjunction)'
    meaning: but, however
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「が」 can be more neutral and simply connect two clauses without a strong sense of contradiction.
      It's often used for simple listing or softening a statement. 「けれど」 tends to imply a slightly stronger,
      yet still polite, contrast.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:が (conjunction)
  - term: しかし
    meaning: but, however
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「しかし」 is a more formal and stronger conjunction, often used to introduce a significant contradiction
      or shift in topic, usually at the beginning of a sentence. 「けれど」 is softer and can connect clauses
      within a sentence.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:しかし・だが・けれど・しかしながら (but・however)
  - term: だが
    meaning: but, however
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だが」 is a more direct and often blunt conjunction, similar to 「しかし」 but more casual. It's
      typically used to introduce a strong contrast. 「けれど」 offers a softer, more polite transition.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:しかし・だが・けれど・しかしながら (but・however)
  - term: しかしながら
    meaning: however, nevertheless (more formal)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「しかしながら」 is the most formal and literary among these. It implies a deeper, more profound contradiction
      or a formal shift in argument. 「けれど」 is much more common in everyday conversation.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:しかし・だが・けれど・しかしながら (but・however)
  - term: でも (but・however)
    meaning: but, however; even
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: As a conjunction, 「でも」 often introduces an alternative or a surprising counterpoint. It can
      feel more emphatic or conversational. 「けれど」 is a straightforward contrast. 「でも」 also has particle
      uses.
    grammar_point: でも (but・however)
  - term: なのに
    meaning: despite, even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「なのに」 expresses a stronger sense of unexpectedness, disappointment, or slight indignation
      regarding the following clause. 「けれど」 is a more neutral connective for contrast.
    grammar_point: のに (unexpected result)
  - term: ものの (although・but)
    meaning: although, but, despite
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ものの」 is more formal and literary, often used in written Japanese. It implies a concession
      where the subsequent clause reveals something contrary to expectation. 「けれど」 is colloquial and widely
      applicable.
    grammar_point: ものの (although・but)
  - term: ところが
    meaning: however, even so, despite that (introduces unexpected outcome)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ところが」 introduces a sudden, often surprising or unexpected turn of events that sharply contrasts
      with the preceding statement. 「けれど」 provides a milder, more anticipated contrast.
    grammar_point: ところが (unexpected contrast)
post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  While all these terms convey a sense of "but" or "however," their proper usage depends heavily on the context, desired nuance, and formality.

  「けれど」 is your reliable, all-purpose connective for expressing contrast in a gentle way, suitable for most situations.

  「が」 is similar but can be even more neutral, sometimes just linking ideas.

  「しかし」, 「だが」, and 「しかしながら」 are progressively more formal and strong, often marking a significant shift or contradiction, with 「しかしながら」 being reserved for very formal or academic contexts.

  「でも」 carries a slightly more emphatic or surprising tone, and also functions as a particle.

  「なのに」 implies a sense of disappointment or strong unexpectedness.

  「ものの」 is a literary choice for concession.

  「ところが」 introduces a dramatic, often surprising, twist.

  Mastering these distinctions allows for much more precise and natural Japanese expression.

        hint: Both 「が」 and 「けれど」 connect contrasting ideas. 「が」 can be more neutral, while 「けれど」 often
          implies a slightly softer or more polite tone. We're looking for a softer contrast.

        english: He is serious, and also very kind.
        hint: 「が」 often implies a more neutral connection between two facts, sometimes just listing. 「けれど」
          emphasizes a slight contrast or adds information while maintaining a softer tone. We're looking
          for a connection that softens the potential contradiction between 'serious' and 'kind'.
    scene: Two colleagues are discussing a new team member.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「真面目 だ けれど」 links two positive traits, showing that 「けれど」 is not always used for
      negative contrast, but simply for adding another piece of information that might seem distinct.
      The use of 「だ けれど」 is natural in casual conversation.

        english: Excuse me, and could you tell me the way to the station?
        hint: 「が」 can be used as a simple connector for a polite request without implying much contrast.
          「けれど」 softens the request by acknowledging a potential inconvenience. We're looking for a usage
          that gently introduces the request.

        english: I'm sorry, and I can't help you today.
        hint: 「が」 can connect apology and refusal in a neutral way. 「けれど」 adds a slightly apologetic nuance
          to the connection itself, making the refusal sound softer despite the direct apology. We're
          looking for a softer refusal.

        english: Tomorrow is rain's forecast, and by the way, have you finished your homework?
        hint: While 「が」 can also introduce a new topic, 「けれど」 often feels slightly smoother and more natural
          when transitioning abruptly or making a polite inquiry after a statement. We're looking for
          a smooth transition.
    scene: Parents talking to their child in the evening.
    register: casual
    setting: instructional
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「けれど」 to transition from discussing the weather to asking about homework shows
      its flexibility in changing topics. The casual tone and the direct question 「終わった？」 are typical
      for an older speaker addressing a younger family member. The phrasing 「〜だ けれど、ところで」 is a natural
      way to pivot a conversation in Japanese.

        english: I wish I could buy this, but it's really expensive.
        hint: 「が」 could be used here, but 「けれど」 often provides a slightly softer or more introspective
          tone when expressing a personal dilemma or desire versus a contrasting reality. We're looking
          for that softer, reflective tone.
    scene: Someone window shopping.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The sentence-final particle 「な」 adds a sense of personal reflection or a mild lament, often
      used to express one's feelings to oneself or in a casual, intimate setting. It enhances the nuance
      of wishing for something while acknowledging an obstacle. Using 「けれど」 here contributes to that introspective
      feeling.
  - english: That is certainly true, but I believe we need to consider other options.
    japanese:

        hint: 「しかし」 is a stronger, more formal conjunction that often introduces a new sentence to present
          a contrasting viewpoint. 「けれど」 allows for a smoother, slightly less assertive transition within
          the same flow of thought, indicating a reservation without outright contradicting. We're looking
          for a softer, more integrated counter-argument.
