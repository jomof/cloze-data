        "それが": "Used as an interjection to introduce an unexpected or contrary statement."
    },
    "jlpt": null,
    "meaning": "Well; but; however; indicates a statement contrary to expectation or something regrettable.",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Informal, conversational.",

        "Usage": "Common in spoken Japanese, particularly when responding to questions or statements with an answer that isn't straightforward or positive."
    },
    "etymology": "「それ」 (sore) refers to \"that,\" and 「が」 (ga) is a particle that often marks the subject but can also indicate contrast. The combination suggests a shift in focus or a contrast to a previous statement or expectation.",
    "writeup": "「それが」is an interjection used in conversation to introduce a response that is contrary to what the listener might expect, or to express a reservation or disappointing outcome. It's often translated as \"well,\" \"but,\" or \"however\" in English, signaling that the speaker is about to provide information that might not be entirely positive or in line with expectations. Think of it as a way to soften a potentially negative or unexpected statement.",
