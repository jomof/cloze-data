        "function": "Introduces a statement that contrasts with what might be expected or hoped for. It often carries a sense of disappointment, reservation, or mild apology.",
        "nuance": "Common in spoken Japanese, particularly when responding to questions or statements with an answer that isn't straightforward or positive.",
        "colocation": "Often followed by a phrase expressing difficulty, regret, or an unexpected outcome.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a discourse marker or interjection, rather than a grammatical particle in this specific usage.",
        "logical-flow": "Signals a deviation from the presumed or desired logical flow of conversation, introducing a contrasting or problematic reality.",
        "temporal-flow": "Implies a shift in the expected temporal progression of events, indicating an unforeseen development.",
        "spatial-flow": "Though not directly related to physical space, it can metaphorically shift the conversational 'space' from a positive outlook to a more challenging reality."

    "etymology": "「それ」 (sore) refers to \"that,\" and 「が」 (ga) is a particle that often marks the subject but can also indicate contrast. The combination suggests a shift in focus or a contrast to a previous statement or expectation.",
    "writeup": "「それが」 is an interjection used in conversation to introduce a response that is contrary to what the listener might expect, or to express a reservation or disappointing outcome. It's often translated as \"well,\" \"but,\" or \"however\" in English, signaling that the speaker is about to provide information that might not be entirely positive or in line with expectations. Think of it as a way to soften a potentially negative or unexpected statement. This expression is primarily used in informal, conversational settings.",

            "nuance": "While 「ところが」 also introduces a contrast or unexpected turn of events, it tends to emphasize a more significant and surprising divergence from what was expected. 「それが」 is often used for milder disappointments or reservations, whereas 「ところが」 highlights a more pronounced contradiction or surprising outcome.",

When explaining something like why you can't attend an event, or why a plan has changed, 「それが」 can soften the blow. In contrast, 「それは」 is often used to clarify or specify something already under discussion, and 「ところが」 is used for more dramatic or unexpected shifts in the situation.",
