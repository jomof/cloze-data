    "formation": {
        "それが": "Used as an interjection to introduce an unexpected or contrary statement."
    },
    "jlpt": "N3",
    "meaning": "Well; but; however; indicates a statement contrary to expectation or something regrettable.",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Informal, conversational.",
        "Function": "Introduces a statement that contrasts with what might be expected or hoped for. It often carries a sense of disappointment, reservation, or mild apology.",
        "Usage": "Common in spoken Japanese, particularly when responding to questions or statements with an answer that isn't straightforward or positive."
    },
    "etymology": "「それ」 (sore) refers to \"that,\" and 「が」 (ga) is a particle that often marks the subject but can also indicate contrast. The combination suggests a shift in focus or a contrast to a previous statement or expectation.",
    "writeup": "「それが」is an interjection used in conversation to introduce a response that is contrary to what the listener might expect, or to express a reservation or disappointing outcome. It's often translated as \"well,\" \"but,\" or \"however\" in English, signaling that the speaker is about to provide information that might not be entirely positive or in line with expectations. Think of it as a way to soften a potentially negative or unexpected statement.",

                    "competing_grammar": "でも、難しそうなんです。",
                    "mitigation": "Using 「でも」would simply state the fact that it looks difficult, without conveying the speaker's implied regret or the sense of going against the listener's expectation. The scene highlights the friend's prior optimism, making 「それが」the appropriate choice to signal the unexpected and disappointing outcome."
                },
                {
                    "competing_grammar": "しかし、難しそうなんです。",
                    "mitigation": "Similar to 「でも」, 「しかし」would present the information as a mere contrast. 「それが」is used here to express the speaker's feeling of having to deliver an unfavorable update that goes against a shared or implied positive expectation."

                    "competing_grammar": "試験は良くなかったんだ。",
                    "mitigation": "Simply stating 「試験は良くなかったんだ」would convey the fact but lack the nuance of regret or the unexpected outcome that 「それが」provides. The scene emphasizes the prior confidence, making 「それが」suitable for delivering disappointing news contrary to expectation."

                    "mitigation": "While 「でも」can introduce a contrast, 「いや、それが」more strongly expresses the speaker's disappointment and the unexpectedness of the situation, especially when retracting a previous plan. The scene highlights the prior certainty of the plan."

                {

                    "mitigation": "「残念ながら」directly states regret, but 「それが」allows the speaker to imply the regret and the unexpected nature of the development in a more conversational and less direct manner, inviting the listener to understand the implication."
