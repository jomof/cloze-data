        "Verb[た] + までのことだ": "Emphasizes the action was not a big deal."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point combines the past form of a verb (た) with 「まで」 (made, meaning 'until', 'to the extent of') and 「だ」 (da, the plain form copula 'is'). The combination indicates that the action described by the verb is all that was done, nothing more. Adding 「のこと」 (koto) emphasizes this limitation further.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「Verb[た]+までだ」 expresses that one's action was \"just,\" \"merely,\" \"simply,\" or \"only\" that action. The nuance is often that the action wasn't a big deal. It's similar to 「〜るまでだ」. Adding 「までのことだ」 emphasizes this even more. It's often used to modestly downplay one's actions and deflect praise, implying one only did the bare minimum. **Important:** This structure is generally used to refer to one's own actions or those of a group one is affiliated with.",

            "nuance": "「俺」is used, marking this as a male speaker. The casual tone with 「〜だ」indicates familiarity with the listener.",
            "etymology": "「俺」is a first-person pronoun typically used by males."
