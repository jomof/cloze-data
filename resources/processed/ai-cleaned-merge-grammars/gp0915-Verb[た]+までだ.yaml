        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "casual",
        "function": "Used to downplay the significance of an action, emphasizing it was nothing special or extraordinary.",
        "nuance": "Implies the action was the bare minimum, not deserving of special praise or blame, often used for modesty or to justify a simple, unavoidable action.",
        "source": "Bunpro",
        "colocation": "Often used with words like 「ただ」 (just), 「〜だけ」 (only), or in contexts where one is dismissing praise or apologizing for a seemingly minor action.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a sentence-ending expression that modifies the preceding verb to convey a sense of limitation or simple fact."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point combines the past form of a verb (た) with 「まで」 (until, to the extent of) and 「だ」 (a copula, indicating affirmation). Etymologically, it suggests that the action only went 'as far as' the verb describes, implying a limitation or lack of further significance.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「Verb[た]+までだ」 expresses that something was \"just\", \"merely\", or \"simply\" done. It's used to downplay the significance of an action, emphasizing that it was nothing special or extraordinary. It is similar to 「〜るまでだ」, but it uses the past tense (た) to indicate that the action has already occurred. This grammar is often used to modestly highlight that one only did the bare minimum, suggesting praising them is unnecessary.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   This structure is primarily used in reference to one's own actions or the actions of a group they are affiliated with. You will not hear this form used to describe others' actions, as that could sound condescending.\n*   The phrase can be strengthened by adding 「までのことだ」 at the end, for additional emphasis.",
