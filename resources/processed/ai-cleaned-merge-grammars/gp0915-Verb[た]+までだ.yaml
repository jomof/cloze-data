        "Verb[た] + までだ": "Indicates that an action was just, merely, or simply performed. It emphasizes the limited nature of the action."

    "meaning": "Just, merely, simply, only",
    "details": {

    "etymology": "The grammar point combines the past form of a verb (た) with 「まで」 (until, to the extent of) and 「だ」 (a copula, indicating affirmation). Etymologically, it suggests that the action only went 'as far as' the verb describes, implying a limitation or lack of further significance.",
    "writeup": "The grammar pattern 「Verb[た]+までだ」 expresses that something was \"just\", \"merely\", or \"simply\" done. It's used to downplay the significance of an action, emphasizing that it was nothing special or extraordinary. It is similar to 「〜るまでだ」, but it uses the past tense (た) to indicate that the action has already occurred. This grammar is often used to modestly highlight that one only did the bare minimum, suggesting praising them is unnecessary.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   This structure is primarily used in reference to one's own actions or the actions of a group they are affiliated with. You will not hear this form used to describe others' actions, as that could sound condescending.\n*   The phrase can be strengthened by adding 「までのことだ」 at the end, for additional emphasis.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene implies the speaker is downplaying the significance of their statement, suggesting it wasn't meant to cause trouble, which is the nuance conveyed by 「までだ」. Without it, the statement could sound like a simple fact without the self-effacing aspect."
