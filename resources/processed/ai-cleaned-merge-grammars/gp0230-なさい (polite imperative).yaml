    "etymology": "「なさい」 is the imperative form of the honorific verb 「なさる」 (nasaru), which means \"to do.\" Thus, it carries a nuance of respect, albeit within the framework of a command. This form evolved from classical Japanese where 「なさる」 was a highly polite verb, and its imperative 「なさい」 retained some of that politeness, making it a suitable form for those in authority to speak to subordinates without being overly harsh.",
    "writeup": "「なさい」 is a polite imperative form derived from the honorific verb 「なさる」, meaning \"to do.\" While it conveys politeness, it is still a command, making it unsuitable for use toward one's superiors. It is most commonly used by those in positions of authority—such as parents or teachers—to instruct those of lower status, like children or students. It can also be used among peers for a gentle suggestion.\n\nTo use 「なさい」, simply attach it to the ます-stem of any verb. For example, 「食べます」 becomes 「食べなさい」 (Tabe nasai), meaning \"Eat.\" 「読みます」 becomes 「読みなさい」 (Yomi nasai), meaning \"Read.\"\n\nA more casual, shortened form, 「な」, is also used, primarily among peers. This shortened 「な」 implies a gentle suggestion or mild urging rather than a direct command. It is crucial to distinguish this shortened 「な」 from the prohibitive 「な」, meaning \"don't,\" which attaches to the dictionary form of a verb. For example, 「食べるな」 (Taberu na) means \"Don't eat,\" while 「食べな」 (Tabe na) means \"Eat (as a suggestion).\"\n\nWhile 「なさい」 itself is grammatically gender-neutral, its usage can often feel more natural when spoken by women, particularly mothers or female teachers, as it conveys a caring yet firm tone. However, male speakers also use it, especially in roles of authority like a father or a coach.",
