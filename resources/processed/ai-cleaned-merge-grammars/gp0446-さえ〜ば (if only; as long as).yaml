etymology: The grammar point 「さえ〜ば」 is a combination of 「さえ」, an adverbial particle indicating 'even'
  or 'only,' and 「ば」, a conjunction particle indicating a hypothetical condition. The particle 「さえ」 emphasizes
  the minimum requirement needed for a certain result, while 「ば」 sets up the conditional clause. Its origins
  are in the combination of these two elements, which together restrict the condition to the most essential
  point, leading to its meaning of 'if only' or 'as long as.'
writeup: As a set expression, **さえ〜ば** is a combination of the adverbial particle **さえ**, and the conjunction
  particle **ば**. It is used to highlight an assumption, and presents (A) as an extreme limitation that
  is required to achieve (B), hypothetically. This structure may be translated as 'if only (A), then (B)',
  'the only thing needed for (A) is (B)', or 'as long as (A), (B)'. **さえ** may be grouped with any word,
  but will require the conjunctive form, or te-form before it when grouped with verbs. It also regularly
  appears after other particles, forming a dual-particle meaning. This use of **さえ** is an example of
  a limit, with (A) being a hypothetical limit presented by the **ば** particle. It is also possible to
  see **さえ** with other hypothetical indicators (such as たら), but is quite rare in modern Japanese, as
  **さえ〜ば** is considered a set pattern. This limitation is also sometimes referred to as a 'stipulation'
  or 'condition'.
false_friends:
  - term: さえ
    meaning: Even
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「さえ」 on its own means "even" and emphasizes the inclusion of something unexpected, while 「さえ〜ば」
      sets a minimal condition for an outcome, focusing on the *only* requirement.
    grammar_point: さえ (even・if only)
  - term: 限り
    meaning: As long as, While… is the case, Limited to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「限り」 (kagiri) indicates a broader limitation or scope, often implying 'as long as X holds
      true', while 「さえ〜ば」 specifies a single, crucial condition, meaning 'if *only* X, then Y'.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary・Noun-の]限り (as long as・to the extent that)'
  - term: からには
    meaning: As long as, Since, Given
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「からには」 (kara niwa) implies a stronger sense of commitment or obligation after a premise is
      established, whereas 「さえ〜ば」 simply states a necessary and sufficient condition for something to
      happen without implying obligation.
    grammar_point: からには (since; obligation)
  - term: たら
    meaning: If/When
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「たら」 also expresses a conditional, 「さえ〜ば」 explicitly highlights that the condition is
      the *sole* or *minimal* requirement for the consequence. The meaning warning for the grammar point
      explicitly states 「さえ〜たら」 is rare.
    grammar_point: たら (conditional, when・if A then B)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「さえ」 on its own emphasizes inclusion, 「限り」 sets broader limits, and 「からには」
  suggests obligation. Remember that 「さえ〜ば」 always focuses on the **minimum requirement** for something
  to occur. To avoid confusion, carefully consider whether you want to emphasize a minimal condition,
  a broad limitation, or a sense of obligation when choosing between these expressions. Also, while 「〜たら」
  can express a conditional, combining it with 「さえ」 is rare; 「さえ〜ば」 is the standard pattern for expressing
  'if only' or 'as long as' a single condition is met.

post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 「さえ〜ば」 is a highly versatile construction that
  can be applied to nouns, i-adjectives, and na-adjectives/nouns functioning adverbially, as well as verbs.
  The key is to remember that it always highlights the **absolute minimum condition** required for something
  else to occur. Pay close attention to the politeness level of the concluding clause, as it should match
  the overall register of your communication.
