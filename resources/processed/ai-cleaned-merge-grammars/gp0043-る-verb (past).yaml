    "etymology": "The past tense auxiliary 「た」 originally comes from the auxiliary verb 「たり」, which indicated completed action or perfective aspect in classical Japanese. 「たり」 gradually simplified to 「た」 over time.",
    "writeup": "To form the past tense of a る-verb (also known as ichidan verbs or group 2 verbs) in Japanese, you remove the 「る」 from the dictionary form and add 「た」 for the casual past tense or 「ました」 for the polite past tense. Remember that 「ました」 is simply 「ます」 conjugated with 「た」, indicating both politeness and past tense.\n\n「た」 can indicate past tense (happened in the past), completion (an action that has finished), or continuation (a new state that is continuing).",
