  Verb[て-form] + る: A casual contraction of Verb[て-form] + いる, common in everyday speech.
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  function: Indicates an ongoing action, a habitual action, or a resultant state.
  nuance: The primary nuance is distinguishing between a continuous, unfinished action (progressive) and
    the current state that is the result of a completed action (resultative).
etymology: The 〜て form is a conjunctive particle, historically derived from the verb つ (completion) and
  あり (existence). When combined with いる (居る, meaning "to exist" or "to be"), it evolved to express either
  a continuous action or a state resulting from a completed action. いる originally meant "to sit" or "to
  be in a specific place," which gradually broadened to simply "to be" or "to exist," leading to its use
  for indicating a persistent state. The contraction てる is a natural phonological reduction in casual
  speech.
writeup: |-
  〜ている is one of the most fundamental and versatile grammar patterns in Japanese. It serves primarily two main functions: indicating an **ongoing action (progressive)** and indicating a **resultative state**.

  1.  **Ongoing Action (Progressive)**: This is similar to the English "be -ing" form. It describes an action that is currently in progress.
      *   Example: 彼女は本を読んでいます。(She is reading a book.)
      *   Example: 雨が降っています。(It is raining.)

  2.  **Resultative State**: This indicates a state that is the result of a completed action. The action itself might have finished, but its outcome or effect continues. This can be tricky for English speakers because it often translates to a simple present tense or present perfect.
      *   Example: 窓が開いています。(The window is open. - The action of opening is complete, and the state of being open continues.)
      *   Example: 結婚しています。(I am married. - The action of marrying is complete, and the state of being married continues.)
      *   Example with an intransitive verb: 電気がついています。(The light is on. - The action of the light turning on is complete, and the state of being on continues.)

      A common pitfall here is with verbs that describe a state of being rather than a continuous action, such as 知る (to know), 住む (to live), 持つ (to have).
      *   知っている (shitte iru) means "I know" (a state of knowing), not "I am knowing."
      *   住んでいる (sunde iru) means "I live in/am living in" (a state of residence).
      *   持っている (motte iru) means "I have/possess" (a state of possession).

  3.  **Habitual Action**: 〜ている can also describe actions that happen regularly or habitually.
      *   Example: 毎日日本語を勉強しています。(I study Japanese every day.)

  4.  **Casual Contraction (〜てる)**: In casual speech, 〜ている often contracts to 〜てる. This is very common and sounds natural among friends and family.

  - term: Verb[dictionary]
    meaning: simple present/future tense, general truth
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike Verb[ている], the Verb[dictionary] form focuses on a future action, general truth, or
      habitual action without emphasizing the ongoing nature or resultant state.
    grammar_point: Verb[dictionary] (dictionary form)
  - term: Verb[て]いるところだ
    meaning: in the process of doing, right now
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Verb[て]いるところだ specifically emphasizes that the action is happening *at this very moment*,
      whereas Verb[ている] can refer to a broader ongoing period or a resultant state.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-て]いるところだ (in the process of doing)'
  - term: Verb[て]ある
    meaning: a state resulting from an intentional action (transitive verb)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Verb[て]ある implies that a state exists *because someone intentionally did something* to create
      that state, often with a transitive verb and an omitted agent. Verb[ている] for resultative states
      often uses intransitive verbs or simply describes the state without implying specific intent to
      prepare it.
    grammar_point: てある (resultant state)
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions might seem similar, paying attention to the specific
  nuance of ongoing action, present state, and intentionality will help distinguish them. Remember that
  Verb[ている] is versatile, covering continuous actions, current states, and habitual actions.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 今 何 を する の？
        english: What will you do now?
        hint: The Verb[dictionary] form implies a future action. We're looking for an action that is currently
          in progress.
    scene: A friend calls you on the phone and asks what you're up to.

          - 図書 館 で 日本 語 を 勉強 する。
        english: I will study Japanese at the library.
        hint: The simple present Verb[dictionary] form suggests a future intention. We're looking for
          an ongoing action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 図書 館 で 日本 語 を 勉強 する ところ です。
        english: I'm just about to study Japanese at the library.

          not just about to start.
    scene: You're telling your professor what you are currently engaged in.

          - 窓 が 開く。
        english: The window opens/will open.

          for the current state of being open.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 窓 が 開け て あり ます。
        english: The window has been opened (by someone).
        hint: Verb[て]ある implies intentional action by someone to leave it open. Here, we're simply stating
          the current state of the window, regardless of *who* opened it or *why*.
    scene: You notice a window in the room is not closed.

        english: He wears a blue shirt (habitually/will wear).
        hint: The Verb[dictionary] form can describe habitual action, but not the current state of wearing.
          We're looking for what he is currently wearing.
    scene: You are describing a person's current attire to a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The verb 着る (kiru - to wear, put on above waist) when used with {着ています} indicates the *state*
      of wearing something, not the action of putting it on. Even though it's polite, the context of describing
      someone to a friend can be casual.
  - english: I'm married.
    japanese:
      - 結婚 {し て い ます}。
      - 結婚 {し て いる}。
      - 結婚 {し てる}。

        english: My cat sleeps on the sofa (habitually/will sleep).
        hint: The Verb[dictionary] for 寝る can describe a habit or future action. We are looking for the
          current state of being asleep.
    scene: You come home and see your cat napping.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: This example uses the casual contracted form {寝てる} (neteru) for 寝ている, which is very common
      in informal speech. The female speaker uses polite language when addressing others, but the casual
      form is natural when speaking to herself or a pet.
  - english: The light is on.

        english: They will live in Tokyo for 10 years.
        hint: The Verb[ます] form of 住む usually refers to a future action or habitual action but doesn't
          convey the sense of *having lived* there up to now. We're looking for a state of continuous
          residence.

          - 彼 は 答え を 知る。
        english: He will come to know the answer/He knows the answer (general).
        hint: 知る in its dictionary form is used for the action of coming to know. To express the state
          of 'knowing,' Verb[ている] is used.
    scene: You are discussing a problem with a colleague, and you mention someone who has the solution.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The verb 知る (shiru - to know/find out) always takes the {知っています} form to express the state
      of 'knowing.' It would be incorrect to use 知ります in this context. The male speaker uses polite language
      suitable for a professional setting.

        hint: 笑いました indicates a completed action in the past. We're looking for an action that was ongoing
          in the past.

post_example_writeup: Understanding the core concept of Verb[ている] requires careful attention to context,
  as the same form can express both ongoing actions and resultant states. Practice distinguishing these
  uses, especially with verbs that commonly describe states like 知る (to know) or 住む (to live), rather
  than continuous actions.
