        "[Noun] + だ": "Indicates a statement of fact or definition.",

    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "auxiliary verb",
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "Used in casual speech and informal writing to state facts or express assertions.",
        "function": "Functions as a copula, connecting a subject (often implied) to a predicate noun or な-adjective.",
        "nuance": "Carries a direct and assertive tone. Unlike です, だ does not convey politeness and is generally used among close friends or family, or when speaking to oneself.",
        "source": "This grammatical concept forms the foundation of Japanese predicate endings, crucial for basic sentence construction.",
        "counterpoint": "Often contrasted with です, which serves a similar function but in polite contexts. While だ is a base form, です is a polite form used to show respect to the listener.",
        "colocation": "Commonly follows nouns and な-adjectives. Rarely directly follows い-adjectives, as it is considered grammatically incorrect or highly unnatural in modern Japanese.",
        "grammatical-role": "Acts as the predicate ending for nominal sentences and な-adjective phrases in plain form.",
        "logical-flow": "Provides a definitive statement of truth or fact regarding the subject, establishing a logical connection between the subject and its characteristic/identity.",
        "temporal-flow": "Implies present tense or a general truth, contrasting with past tense forms like だった.",
        "spatial-flow": "Not directly related to spatial flow, but the directness of だ can imply immediacy or close observation in descriptive contexts (e.g., あれは桜だ - 'That's a cherry blossom')."
    },
    "etymology": "The origin of 「だ」 is thought to be a contraction of the phrase 「である」, which is the more formal or literary form of the copula. 「で」 is the te-form of the copula 「です」, and 「ある」 means 'to be' (animate). Over time, 「である」 became shortened to 「だ」, losing some of its formality in the process. This evolution reflects a linguistic shift towards more casual and colloquial speech patterns.",
    "writeup": "「だ」 is the equivalent of \"is\" in English. It primarily expresses determination or assertion. As a casual grammar structure, it is not used in polite sentences. Instead, you will encounter it in informal conversations, personal diaries, or casual written communication.\n\nTechnically, 「だ」 is classified as an auxiliary verb, attaching itself to other words to provide them with meaning and serve as a predicate. Its role is comparable to 「です」, but 「です」 is exclusively used in polite contexts and is often one of the first grammatical patterns Japanese learners encounter.\n\n「だ」 consistently follows nouns or words that function similarly to nouns, such as な-adjectives.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「だ」 should **never** be attached directly to the end of い-adjectives. Doing so is considered grammatically incorrect and sounds highly unnatural. For い-adjectives, it is appropriate to use their plain form directly (e.g., 「大きい」 for \"is big\") or to attach a polite equivalent like 「です」 (e.g., 「大きいです」 for \"is big\").\n*   While 「だ」 is often perceived as the \"casual form\" of 「です」, this is not entirely accurate. 「です」 is a polite speech word, whereas the official \"formal version\" of 「だ」 is 「である」. 「である」 is typically found in academic papers, official documents, and formal written texts, while 「です」 is prevalent in polite spoken Japanese.",
