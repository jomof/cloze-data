It indicates a strong assertion or determination.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n*   It is a casual grammar structure, so it is not appropriate for polite speech. Use 「です」 instead for polite situations.\n*   「だ」 connects to nouns and *na*-adjectives.\n*   It is **incorrect** to directly attach 「だ」 to *i*-adjectives. Use 「です」 instead.\n*   Although often called the casual form of 「です」, 「だ」's formal equivalent is actually 「である」, commonly seen in formal writing or articles.\n",
