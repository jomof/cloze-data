        "function": "Forms a noun indicating the method, way, or means of performing the verb. Often used with verbs like がない (nai) or が悪い (warui) to express that something is impossible or difficult to do.",

    "etymology": "「よう」 originates from the verb 「為る（する）」, meaning \"to do.\" Over time, it evolved into a suffix indicating the *manner* or *way* of doing something. Its usage reflects a transition from a verb of action to a noun emphasizing the method of action.",
    "writeup": "The 「よう」 grammar point, when attached to the ます-stem of a verb, transforms the verb into a noun that describes **the method, way, or means of performing that action.** It frequently appears in phrases like 「～ようがない」 (there's no way to do...) or 「～ようによっては」 (depending on how you do...). Consider it a way to discuss *how* something is done or *if* something can be done at all.\n\nIt is often used to express impossibility or difficulty, especially with 「～ようがない」. For example, 「直しようがない」 means \"there's no way to fix it.\" While similar to 「方」 (kata), 「よう」 often carries a nuance of method or means, sometimes implying a specific or correct way of doing something. It can also imply that no method exists.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While 「よう」 focuses on the action itself, 「方」 often refers to a general method or direction. For instance, 「やりようがない」 means \"there's no way to do it\" (emphasizing the lack of means or method), versus 「やり方がない」 which means \"there's no method\" (a more general statement about methods)."

            "nuance": "「仕様」 is a noun meaning 'way of doing' or 'method', but it often pertains to specifications or fixed ways of doing something, like a machine's specifications. 「仕様がない」 is commonly used to describe a situation that is unavoidable or beyond one's control, similar to \"it can't be helped.\" It is often associated with technical or engineering contexts."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「よう」 and 「方」 can indicate ways of doing something, 「よう」 tends to be used when expressing whether something can be done or how it can be done, often in negative constructions, focusing on the feasibility of the action. 「方」, on the other hand, is more general and refers to the method itself, akin to 'how to'. 「仕様」, particularly in 「仕様がない」, carries a nuance of an unavoidable situation or fixed specification, distinct from the active method implied by 「よう」 or 「方」.",
