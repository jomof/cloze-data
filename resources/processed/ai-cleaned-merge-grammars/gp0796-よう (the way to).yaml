    "etymology": "This 「よう」 comes from the verb 「様 (よう)する」, meaning \"to do,\" \"to manage,\" or \"to deal with.\" When attached to the ます stem of a verb, it transforms the verb into a noun that describes the manner or method of performing that action.",
    "writeup": "The 「よう」 suffix, when attached to the ます-stem of a verb, creates a noun that signifies \"the way to do\" something or \"a method of doing\" something. It's important to note that 「よう」 often appears in expressions that convey difficulty or impossibility, such as 「～ようがない」 (there's no way to do...). It can also describe a general way of doing something, as in 「読みようによっては」 (depending on how you read it).",
