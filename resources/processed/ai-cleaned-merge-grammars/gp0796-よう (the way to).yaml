        "Formation": "Verb (ます-stem) + よう",
        "Function": "Forms a noun indicating the method, way, or means of performing the verb. Often used with verbs like がない (nai) or が悪い (warui) to express that something is impossible or difficult to do.",

        "Register": "Generally neutral to formal.",
        "Common Patterns": "V-ます + ようがない (there is no way to do...); V-ます + ようが悪い (the way of doing...is bad); V-ます + ようによっては (depending on how you do...)"
    },
    "writeup": "The 「よう」 grammar point, when attached to the ます-stem of a verb, transforms the verb into a noun that describes **the method, way, or means of performing that action.** It frequently appears in phrases like 「～ようがない」 (there's no way to do...) or 「～ようによっては」 (depending on how you do...). Consider it a way to discuss *how* something is done or *if* something can be done at all.\n\n*   **Common Uses:** It's often used to express impossibility or difficulty, especially with 「～ようがない」. For example, 「直しようがない」 means \"there's no way to fix it.\"\n*   **Subtleties:** While similar to 「方」 (kata), 「よう」 often carries a nuance of method or means, sometimes implying a specific or correct way of doing something. It can also imply that no method exists.",

    "etymology": "「よう」 originates from the verb 「為る（する）」, meaning \"to do.\" Over time, it evolved into a suffix indicating the *manner* or *way* of doing something. Its usage reflects a transition from a verb of action to a noun emphasizing the method of action.",
