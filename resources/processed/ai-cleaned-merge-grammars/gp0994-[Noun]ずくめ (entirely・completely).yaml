pronunciation:
  katakana: ズクメ
  romaji: zukume
formation:
  Noun + ずくめ: Indicates something is made up entirely or exclusively of that noun.
  Noun + ずくめ + の + Noun: Indicates that the following noun is entirely characterized by the preceding
    noun.
jlpt: N1
etymology: The term ずくめ originates from the verb 尽くす (tsukusu), meaning "to exhaust" or "to use up completely."
  The め (me) is an added suffix, thought to emphasize the completeness. Over time, づくめ (dzukume) became
  ずくめ (zukume), reflecting a shift in pronunciation and preferred writing.
writeup: 'The term ずくめ (zukume) is used to express that something is entirely or exclusively made up of
  something else. It stems from the verb 尽くす (tsukusu), meaning "to exhaust" or "use completely." The
  め (me) is added as a suffix, thought to emphasize the completeness. It attaches directly to nouns, indicating
  that the specified element is so prevalent that nothing else is apparent. There are two main formations
  for ずくめ: 1. **[Noun] + ずくめ**: This form functions adverbially, indicating that the preceding noun completely
  dominates the situation or period. For example, 「仕事ずくめ」 (shigoto zukume) means "nothing but work." 2.
  **[Noun] + ずくめ + の + Noun**: In this form, ずくめ acts as an adjectival phrase modifying the following
  noun. For example, 「黒ずくめの服」 (kuro zukume no fuku) means "an outfit that is entirely black." While づくめ
  (dzukume) might appear in older texts, ずくめ (zukume) is the standard form now. ずくめ can be used in both
  positive and negative situations, and its usage is flexible across various registers, from casual conversation
  to more formal declarations. It is often seen in fixed expressions. Be mindful of its usage and aim
  to apply it in scenarios you''ve encountered before. **Important Considerations:** The nuance of ずくめ
  is that the noun is **so dominant** that it describes the entirety or exclusive nature of the situation
  or item. It is not merely ''a lot of'' but ''nothing but'' or ''completely composed of''. It often implies
  an overwhelming or all-encompassing characteristic, rather than just a large quantity or limitation.'

  - term: ばかり (only・excessive)
    meaning: Only, just, nothing but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike ずくめ, ばかり implies limitation or exclusivity, often with a subtle nuance of 'only' or
      'nothing but' (to the exclusion of others), and can also mean 'just finished'.
    grammar_point: ばかり (only・just, often with nuance of excess)
  - term: だらけ (covered in)
    meaning: Full of; covered in
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike ずくめ which expresses complete composition, だらけ indicates being covered with or full
      of undesirable things, usually with a negative nuance, focusing on messiness or undesirability.
    grammar_point: '[Noun]だらけ (full of, negative nuance)'
  - term: ずくし (all sorts of)
    meaning: All sorts of; all kinds of; exhaustive
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike ずくめ, which indicates something is completely or exclusively of one type, ずくし implies
      a thorough list or an exhaustive array of different things, emphasizing variety.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ずくし (all sorts of)
post_false_friends_writeup: The key difference to remember is that ずくめ (zukume) indicates something is
  made up entirely or exclusively of one thing. In contrast, ばかり (bakari) implies a limitation or exclusivity,
  often with a subtle nuance of 'only' or 'nothing but (to the exclusion of others)'. だらけ (darake) refers
  to being covered in or full of undesirable things, usually with a negative connotation. Lastly, ずくし
  (zukushi) means 'all sorts of' or 'an exhaustive list of various items', emphasizing variety rather
  than singular dominance.

        english: Lately, it's been only good things, and every day is enjoyable.
        hint: While {ばかり} can mean 'only' or 'nothing but', it sometimes implies a lack of variety or
