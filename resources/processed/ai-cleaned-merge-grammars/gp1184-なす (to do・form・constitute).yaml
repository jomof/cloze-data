etymology: 「なす」 originally derives from the verb 「為す」, which has roots in classical Japanese. Its meaning
  has evolved over time to encompass various forms of "doing," "making," and "constituting." The character
  為自体 implies an an active process of doing, making, or forming.
writeup: 'The verb 「なす」 is a somewhat formal and often literary way of saying "to do," "to perform," "to
  make," or "to constitute." It carries a nuanced sense of actively causing something to happen, bringing
  something into existence, or forming the essential nature of something. While similar to 「する」 or 「行う」,
  「なす」 is distinctly more formal and is frequently encountered in written texts, academic discourse, and
  more serious or reflective contexts. 「なす」 can be employed in several key patterns: *   **[Noun1] を [Noun2]
  と なす**: This structure signifies "to regard Noun1 as Noun2" or "to transform Noun1 into Noun2." It implies
  a deliberate act of conceptualizing or changing the nature of something. *   **[Noun] を なす**: This usage
  generally means "to do Noun" or "to perform Noun." It often appears when speaking of actions that have
  a significant impact, are performed with effort, or relate to moral or foundational deeds, such as "to
  do good" (善 を なす) or "to constitute a foundation" (基礎 を なす). *   **[Noun] が なされる**: The passive form,
  「なされる」, is quite common. It conveys that an action is "being done" or "being performed" in an impersonal,
  formal, or objective manner, often seen in reports, academic writing, or when describing official procedures.'

  - term: する
    meaning: To do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「なす」 and 「する」 both mean "to do," 「なす」 is more formal and often used in written language
      or when describing the constitution of something. 「する」 is much more versatile and common in everyday
      speech and applies to a wider range of actions without implying a deep constitutive meaning or formality
      unless specified by context or other particles or phrases that accompany it.
    grammar_point: する (to do・make)
  - term: 行う
    meaning: To conduct; to carry out
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「行う」 also means "to do" or "to carry out," but it is generally used for planned or organized
      events or actions, whereas 「なす」 has a broader sense of causing something to be or transforming something.
      「行う」 emphasizes the execution of a pre-determined plan or event, while 「なす」 emphasizes the creation
      or formation of something, or a more profound act of 'doing'.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:行う (to conduct・to carry out)
  - term: となる
    meaning: To become
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「A を B と なす」 means "to regard A as B" or "to change A into B," 「A が B と なる」 means "A
      becomes B." 「となる」 describes a change or result that occurs, while 「なす」 describes the active process
      of regarding or transforming, or the act of constituting something from its core essence. 「なす」 implies
      human agency or an inherent forming quality, whereas 「となる」 denotes a state of being or a natural
      transition.
    grammar_point: となる (to become・result in)
  - term: 見なす
    meaning: To regard as; to consider as
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike 「なす」 which can imply an active transformation or the inherent constitution of something,
      「見なす」 primarily means to 'regard as' or 'consider as', often based on a judgment or perception without
      necessarily changing the actual nature of the object. 「なす」 can involve a deeper, more profound act
      of shaping or forming, while 「見なす」 is more about how something is perceived or interpreted.

  - term: 築く
    meaning: To build; to establish
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「なす」 can mean to 'constitute' or 'form' a foundation, especially in a conceptual or
      inherent sense, 「築く」 specifically means to 'build' or 'establish' something tangible or abstract
      through effort and construction. 「築く」 implies a process of physical or systematic creation, whereas
      「なす」 suggests a more fundamental or essential contribution to something's existence or identity.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:築く (to build・to establish)
  - term: 果たす
    meaning: To fulfill; to accomplish; to carry out
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「なす」 can mean to 'perform' or 'fulfill' a duty or role, 「果たす」 specifically means to
      'accomplish' or 'carry out' a task to its completion, emphasizing the successful execution of an
      obligation or goal. 「果たす」 focuses on bringing a task to an end, often with a sense of completion
      or duty performed, while 「なす」 can refer to the ongoing act of doing or constituting something, without
      necessarily implying completion.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:果たす (to fulfill・to accomplish・to carry out)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「なす」, 「する」, and 「行う」 all translate to "do" in English, but they have different
  nuances. 「なす」 is more formal and often used in written language. 「する」 is the most common and versatile.
  「行う」 is generally used for planned or organized events or actions. Additionally, 「A を B と なす」 (regard
  A as B or change A into B) is different from 「A が B と なる」 (A becomes B). When considering how something
  is perceived, 「見なす」 means 'to regard as', whereas 「なす」 implies an active transformation or the actual
  constitution of something. For constructing or establishing, 「築く」 implies physical building, while 「なす」
  suggests a more fundamental role in forming something. Finally, for completing tasks, 「果たす」 specifically
  means to fulfill a duty, while 「なす」 has a broader sense of performing or bringing about. Pay close attention
  to the context to choose the most appropriate verb.

post_example_writeup: 「なす」 is a versatile verb with several core meanings. When used with the pattern
  「Noun1 を Noun2 と なす」, it expresses a deliberate transformation or a conceptual reframing of Noun1 into
  Noun2. This is different from a simple change of state. When describing an action, especially in its
  passive form 「なされる」, it denotes a formal or impersonal execution, often seen in official reports or
  academic contexts. Lastly, 「Noun を なす」 is used to describe something that constitutes or forms the fundamental
  basis of another entity, or to perform significant actions like doing good deeds.
