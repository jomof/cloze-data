formation:
  どなた: Used as a polite interrogative pronoun for "who". It replaces 誰 (dare) in polite contexts.
  '[どなた] + particle': It typically functions as a noun, so particles like が・は・に・と・から・で・を can follow it,
    depending on its grammatical role in the sentence.
jlpt: N5
etymology: どなた is a more polite and respectful form of 誰 (だれ). It originates from 何方 (いずかた), which meant
  "which direction" or "which person" in classical Japanese, and then evolved to signify a polite way
  to refer to a person. The "ど" part is common in interrogative words (どこ・どう・どれ). The "なた" part is an
  honorific suffix, derived from 方 (かた), meaning "person" or "direction", conveying respect. This evolution
  highlights how the concept of 'direction' or 'side' became a respectful way to refer to an individual.
writeup: どなた is a polite interrogative pronoun used to ask "who". It is the polite equivalent of 誰 (だれ),
  which is more casual. While 誰 is appropriate in most informal settings, どなた should be used when addressing
  strangers, superiors, or in formal situations where politeness is required. It conveys respect towards
  the person being asked about, or the listener. Like 誰, どなた can take various particles depending on its
  grammatical function in the sentence. For example, どなたが (who is the subject), どなたに (to whom), どなたと (with
  whom), どなたを (whom as object), and どなたから (from whom). It is commonly used when answering a phone call
  (e.g., どなたですか？ - "Who is this?"), asking about someone's identity in a respectful manner, or when inquiring
  about a third party in a formal context. While どちら様 (どちらさま) is even more polite and formal, どなた strikes
  a good balance for general polite use.

  - term: 誰
    meaning: who (casual)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 誰 is the casual form of "who". It lacks the politeness and respect conveyed by どなた and should
      be reserved for friends, family, or informal contexts. Using 誰 in formal situations can sound rude.
    grammar_point: 誰 (who)
  - term: どちら様
    meaning: who (very polite・honorific)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: どちら様 is a more formal and honorific way to ask "who", often used in customer service or when
      you need to be extremely respectful, especially regarding someone's identity. どなた is generally polite
      but どちら様 adds an extra layer of deference, implying "which esteemed person."
    grammar_point: <suggest>:どちら様 (who・polite honorific)
  - term: どちら
    meaning: which (of two)・which way・polite who (among options)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: どちら primarily means "which (of two)" or "which way." While it can sometimes be used to ask
      "who" when choosing from a limited set of options (e.g., "どちらが担当者ですか？" - "Which one is the person
      in charge?"), it's not a direct, general equivalent for "who" like どなた. どなた is for identity, どちら
      is for choice or direction.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:どちら (which of two)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between どなた、誰、どちら様、and どちら, consider the level of politeness
  and the specific context. どなた is suitable for most polite everyday interactions. 誰 is for casual settings.
  どちら様 should be reserved for highly formal or honorific situations, often used when inquiring about a
  customer or guest. どちら is generally used when asking "which one" from a limited selection, or "which
  way," and its usage for "who" is more specific and less general than どなた.
