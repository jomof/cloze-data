    "etymology": "The particle 「しか」 likely evolved from a combination of 「し」 (an emphatic particle) and 「か」 (a question particle). Over time, it transitioned to its current exclusive meaning, always used with a negative verb.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「しか」 serves to express exclusivity or limitation, akin to the English \"only\" or \"nothing but.\" It is a distinguishing feature of 「しか」 that it **must** always be paired with a negative predicate, most commonly the plain negative form 「ない」 or the polite negative 「ません」. This inherent negativity is why 「しか〜ない」 is often translated as \"there is nothing but (X)\" or \"only (X) exists,\" emphasizing the singular presence or characteristic of X.\n\n「しか」 primarily functions with nouns, pronouns, or quantity expressions to limit the scope to only that element. For example, 「水{しか} 飲ま{ない}」 means \"I drink nothing but water,\" highlighting that no other beverage is consumed. It denotes a strict boundary or a singular focus.\n\nIt is crucial to differentiate 「しか〜ない」 from a related, but distinct, grammatical construction where 「しかない」 directly follows a verb in its plain form (e.g., 「するしかない」). In that context, 「しかない」 translates to \"have no choice but to do X\" or \"X is the only option,\" indicating a lack of alternatives. This specific lesson focuses exclusively on 「しか」 as a limiting particle used with nouns and quantities.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「しか〜ない」 emphasizes exclusivity through a negative verb, other expressions convey similar ideas with different nuances. 「だけ」 is a simple \"only\" that can be used with affirmative verbs and lacks the strong sense of limitation or slight negativity inherent in 「しか」. 「ばかり」 often describes a continuous state or an excessive focus, sometimes with a mild complaint. 「でしかない」 conveys that something is *merely* what it is, stripping away any perceived importance. The standalone 「しかない」 (verb + しかない) is a completely different grammatical construction meaning \"have no choice but.\" More formal expressions like 「にほかならない」 and 「をおいてほかに〜ない」 offer stronger assertions of exclusivity or unique suitability. 「きり」 is another particle for \"only,\" but it does not require a negative verb and can also imply a continuous state or a \"since\" meaning. Understanding these differences is key to accurately conveying precise shades of meaning in Japanese.",
