    "etymology": "The particle 「しか」 likely evolved from a combination of 「し」 (an emphatic particle) and 「か」 (a question particle). Over time, it transitioned to its current exclusive meaning, always used with a negative verb.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「しか」 serves to express exclusivity or limitation, akin to the English \"only\" or \"nothing but.\" It is a distinguishing feature of 「しか」 that it **must** always be paired with a negative predicate, most commonly the plain negative form 「ない」 or the polite negative 「ません」. This inherent negativity is why 「しか〜ない」 is often translated as \"there is nothing but (X)\" or \"only (X) exists,\" emphasizing the singular presence or characteristic of X.\n\n「しか」 primarily functions with nouns, pronouns, or quantity expressions to limit the scope to only that element. For example, 「水{しか} 飲ま{ない}」 means \"I drink nothing but water,\" highlighting that no other beverage is consumed. It denotes a strict boundary or a singular focus.\n\nIt is crucial to differentiate 「しか〜ない」 from a related, but distinct, grammatical construction where 「しかない」 directly follows a verb in its plain form (e.g., 「するしかない」). In that context, 「しかない」 translates to \"have no choice but to do X\" or \"X is the only option,\" indicating a lack of alternatives. This specific lesson focuses exclusively on 「しか」 as a limiting particle used with nouns and quantities.",

            "meaning": "Only, just",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「しか」, 「だけ」 can be used with affirmative verbs. 「水 だけ 飲む」 means \"I only drink water,\" focusing on the quantity without the strong implication of limitation or negativity that 「しか」 carries."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「ばかり」 often implies repetition or doing nothing else, sometimes with a negative connotation. 「食べて ばかり いる」 means \"You're always just eating.\" It can also mean \"just finished.\""

            "nuance": "This is used to emphasize that something is *nothing more than* what it is, often suggesting insignificance or a lack of depth. 「単なる 偶然 で しか ない」 (It's merely a coincidence). It expresses exclusivity of a different kind – a lack of additional qualities or meaning."

            "nuance": "This is a distinct grammar point. When 「しかない」 follows a plain verb form (e.g., 「するしかない」), it means \"have no choice but to do X\" or \"X is the only option.\" It implies an unavoidable action due to lack of alternatives. This differs from 「しか〜ない」 (noun + negative verb), which limits the *scope* to a specific noun/quantity."

            "nuance": "A more emphatic and often literary expression of exclusivity, similar to \"there is no one/nothing else but X.\" 「彼 を おいてほかに 適任 者 は いない」 (There's no one else suitable but him). It implies that the item/person mentioned is uniquely qualified or exceptional, making others unsuitable."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「しか〜ない」 emphasizes exclusivity through a negative verb, other expressions convey similar ideas with different nuances. 「だけ」 is a simple \"only\" that can be used with affirmative verbs and lacks the strong sense of limitation or slight negativity inherent in 「しか」. 「ばかり」 often describes a continuous state or an excessive focus, sometimes with a mild complaint. 「でしかない」 conveys that something is *merely* what it is, stripping away any perceived importance. The standalone 「しかない」 (verb + しかない) is a completely different grammatical construction meaning \"have no choice but.\" More formal expressions like 「にほかならない」 and 「をおいてほかに〜ない」 offer stronger assertions of exclusivity or unique suitability. 「きり」 is another particle for \"only,\" but it does not require a negative verb and can also imply a continuous state or a \"since\" meaning. Understanding these differences is key to accurately conveying precise shades of meaning in Japanese.",
