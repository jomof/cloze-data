grammar_point: い-Adjective[くても] (concessive)
learn_before:
  - Verb[ても] (concessive)
id: gp9999
meaning: even if (adjective); even though (adjective)
pronunciation:
  katakana: イ・アジェクティブ・クテモ
  romaji: i-adjective kutemo
formation:
  い-Adjective (remove い) + くても: Used to express 'even if' or 'even though' with an い-adjective.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The formation combines the い-adjective's conjunctive form (連用形 - ren'yōkei) ending in 「く」,
  with the particle 「て」, which indicates connection or cause-and-effect, and the particle 「も」, which conveys
  the meaning of 'even' or 'also'. Historically, 「て」 and 「も」 combined to form a concessive meaning across
  various parts of speech, and this specific construction applies it to い-adjectives.
writeup: |-
  The grammar pattern 「い-Adjective[くても]」 is used to express a concessive condition, meaning "even if (adjective)" or "even though (adjective)." It indicates that despite the state or quality described by the い-adjective, the main clause still happens or holds true.

  This form is created by taking an い-adjective, removing its final 「い」, and attaching 「くても」. For example, 「寒い」 (samui - cold) becomes 「寒くても」 (samukutemo - even if it's cold). The particle 「も」 (mo) in this construction signifies 'even' or 'also,' effectively creating the concessive meaning. This pattern is versatile and can be used in a variety of situations, from describing weather to personal feelings or the qualities of objects.

  It is important to note that while 「い-Adjective[くても]」 expresses a counter-expectation, it generally does not carry the same strong nuance of surprise or dissatisfaction that 「のに」 does. It simply states a condition and an outcome that is not prevented by that condition.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[て]も
    meaning: even if (verb); even though (verb)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「Verb[て]も」 applies the concessive meaning to verbs, whereas 「い-Adjective[くても]」 is specifically
      for い-adjectives. The underlying 「ても」 structure is the same, but the part of speech it attaches
      to differs. We're looking for an adjective.
    grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
  - term: な-Adjectiveでも
    meaning: even if (na-adjective); even though (na-adjective)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to verbs, 「な-Adjectiveでも」 applies the concessive meaning to な-adjectives (by adding
      「で」 before 「も」), not い-adjectives. We're looking for an adjective.
    grammar_point: でも (even・any・no matter)
  - term: Nounでも
    meaning: even (noun); even if (noun)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「Nounでも」 applies the concessive meaning to nouns. The basic principle of adding 「も」 remains,
      but the connection to a noun is different from modifying an い-adjective. We're looking for an adjective.
    grammar_point: でも (even・any・no matter)
  - term: なのに
    meaning: even though; despite (with unexpected or dissatisfied nuance)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express a concessive idea, 「なのに」 (which is 「な」 + 「のに」) implies surprise, disappointment,
      or a sense of 'contrary to expectation.' 「い-Adjective[くても]」 is a more neutral statement of 'even
      if,' without the strong emotional undertone. We're looking for an adjective.
    grammar_point: のに (unexpected result)
  - term: けれど・けど
    meaning: but; although
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「けれど」 and 「けど」 are general conjunctions that connect two clauses, often indicating a contrast
      or concession. They are broader in application and don't specifically attach to the く form of い-adjectives
      to express 'even if'. We're looking for an adjective.
    grammar_point: しかし (but・however)
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions all convey some form of concession or contrast, 「い-Adjective[くても]」
  is specifically structured for い-adjectives to mean 'even if/though [adjective]'. 「ても」 (general) and
  「でも」 (for な-adjectives/nouns) use the same core particle 「も」 but attach to different parts of speech.
  「なのに」 and 「けれど/けど」 are conjunctions that express concession or contrast, but they lack the direct 'even
  if' structure that 「い-Adjective[くても]」 provides for adjectives and often carry different nuances, such
  as strong unexpectedness or simply a mild contrast.
examples:
  - english: Even if it's hot, I want to eat hot pot.

          - 暑い けれど、鍋 を 食べ たい です。
        english: It's hot, but I want to eat hot pot.
        hint: 「けれど」 is a general conjunction indicating contrast. The sentence is looking for a stronger
          'even if' nuance for the adjective.

post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, 「い-Adjective[くても]」 is a fundamental way to express
  a concessive idea, allowing you to acknowledge a quality or state while still proceeding with an action
  or statement that might seem contrary to it. It is a very common and natural way to speak in Japanese.
