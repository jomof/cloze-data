        "Verb[て] + Consequence": "Indicates that the verb in て-form is the reason for the following consequence.",

    },
    "etymology": "The 「て」 form originally functioned as a conjunctive particle, linking clauses together. Over time, it developed the nuance of indicating cause and effect, particularly when the result (the second clause) is something less controllable by the speaker.",
    "writeup": "The 「て」-form of a verb (or 「で」 for nouns and *na*-adjectives) can express the meaning of \"because,\" \"due to,\" or \"since.\" This usage often implies that the speaker did not have control over the outcome described in the second part of the sentence. The first part of the sentence (A) provides the reason or cause, and the second part (B) describes the resulting situation or feeling. This grammar point emphasizes the uncontrollable nature of the (B) statement, suggesting that (A) led to (B) in a way that the speaker couldn't prevent or easily influence. It is useful for expressing feelings like being troubled, happy, surprised, tired, or worried as a result of some preceding action or state. For nouns and *na*-adjectives, the particle 「で」 is used instead of 「て」.",
