    "etymology": "The particle 「て」 originally evolved from the conjunctive particle 「して」. Over time, 「して」 was shortened to 「て」, retaining its function of connecting clauses and indicating a reason or cause.",
    "writeup": "The 「て」-form of a verb can indicate \"because,\" \"since,\" or \"due to\" in English. When using this grammar point, the (B) statement is often something beyond the speaker's control. For verbs and い-adjectives, use the 「て」-form. For nouns and な-adjectives, use 「で」. The nuance is closer to \"(A) and I'm troubled\" or \"(A) and I'm happy,\" where the feeling is a natural consequence of (A). This grammar point expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between two events or states.",

            "etymology": "「捕まって」is the te-form of 「捕まる」, which means 'to be caught'."
