    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ていく」 is a combination of the 「て」-form of a verb and the verb 「いく」(iku), which means \"to go.\" The 「て」-form connects actions, and 「いく」 indicates movement away from the speaker. Over time, this combination evolved to express the idea of something starting and continuing, or moving away.",
    "writeup": "This grammar construction combines the 「て」 particle with the verb 「行く」 (iku, \"to go\"). To use it, attach 「て」 to a verb, then follow it with 「いく」. The nuance is usually that \"(A) happened and then went,\" or \"will happen, and then go.\" In other words, it depends on whether 「いく」 is in present or past tense.\n\n「ていく」 can represent time or a physical place. When representing a physical place, the kanji form 「行く」 is more likely, but this isn't a strict rule. When used in relation to time, the nuance is usually that something has already started or is about to start, and then will continue to progress in the same way.\n\nThis is the opposite of 「てくる」, which indicates that something has finally reached a certain state after progressing in that way for some time.\n\nCompared to English, 「ていく」 is similar to the phrase \"to go on to (A)\" in relation to time. It focuses on the speaker's journey to a specific point. For example, \"She went on to become a doctor after university.\"",
