    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ていく」 is formed by combining the te-form of a verb with the verb 「いく」(to go). The 「て」 particle connects actions, and 「いく」 indicates movement away from the speaker or a continuation into the future. The combination creates the nuance of something starting and continuing, or going away while doing something.",
    "writeup": "This grammar construction combines the te-form 「て」 with the verb 「いく」(to go). To use 「ていく」, attach 「て」 to any verb, then follow it with 「いく」. The nuance suggests '(A) happened and then went' or 'will happen, and then go'. The tense of 「いく」 (present or past) determines whether the action is ongoing or completed.\n\n「ていく」 can describe both time and physical place. When indicating physical place, the kanji form 「行く」 is more common, but the choice depends on the writer.\n\nIn relation to time, 「ていく」 indicates something has started or is about to start and will continue progressing in the same manner. This contrasts with 「てくる」, which indicates something reaching a certain state after progressing for some time.\n\n**Important Consideration**\n\n「ていく」 is similar to the English phrase \"to go on to (A)\" when referring to time. It emphasizes the speaker's journey to a specific point. For example, \"She went on to become a doctor after university.\"",
