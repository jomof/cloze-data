        "part-of-speech": "adverb",
        "register": "semi-formal",
        "usage-context": "general use",
        "function": "To introduce a strong hypothetical condition.",
        "nuance": "Adds a sense of heightened uncertainty or a more dramatic 'what if' to the conditional clause. It implies a situation that may be unlikely, significant, or one the speaker is seriously contemplating."
    },
    "etymology": "「もしも」 is derived from 「もし」 (if), combined with the particle 「も」, which adds emphasis or the sense of \"even.\" While its literal meaning is \"even a bit,\" it primarily serves to strengthen the hypothetical nature of 「もし」.",
    "writeup": "「もしも」 functions as an adverb in Japanese, serving to emphasize the hypothetical nature of a statement. It strengthens the nuance of \"if\" or \"in the case that,\" often implying a higher degree of uncertainty or a more significant hypothetical scenario. This adverb is almost exclusively paired with various conditional expressions such as 〜なら, 〜ば, 〜と, 〜たら, or 〜ても, and it is typically placed at the beginning of a sentence or clause.\n\nWhile 「もし」 also conveys a hypothetical condition, the addition of 「も」 in 「もしも」 intensifies this meaning, suggesting a stronger sense of uncertainty, possibility, or even a dramatic \"what if\" scenario. This makes it particularly effective for situations where the outcome is less certain, more impactful, or when the speaker wishes to convey a heightened sense of speculation.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n*   「もしも」 is frequently used when discussing a potential *result* of a hypothetical situation. That is, if condition A is true, then outcome B will occur.\n*   In contrast, 「たとえ〜ても」 also expresses a hypothetical. However, it emphasizes that a certain outcome will happen *regardless* of the condition, or explores the consequence even in an unlikely scenario, rather than a direct result contingent on the hypothetical.",
