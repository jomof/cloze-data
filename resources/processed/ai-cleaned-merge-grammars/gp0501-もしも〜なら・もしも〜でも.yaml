    "etymology": "「もしも」is derived from 「もし」 (if) combined with the particle 「も」, which adds emphasis or the sense of \"even.\" It strengthens the hypothetical nature of 「もし」.",
    "writeup": "「もしも」is an adverb in Japanese that emphasizes the base meaning of 「もし」, which is \"if\" or \"in the case that\". Therefore, the literal meaning of 「もしも」 is \"even a bit\". Because 「もし」and 「もしも」are almost exclusively paired with sentences that use some sort of assumption, or \"hypothesis\" based expression, 「もしも」will often be translated as \"supposing that\". 「もしも」is often used at the beginning of sentences that include almost any form of hypothesis expression, for example, 「ば」, 「と」, 「なら」, or 「ても」.\n\nImportant Notes:\n*   「もし」 and 「もしも」are most often used to express some type of result. This means that B will happen *if* A happens, or *if* A is true.\n*   However, 「たとえ」 is contrastive, and therefore asks \"what the result\" of a specific situation may be.",
