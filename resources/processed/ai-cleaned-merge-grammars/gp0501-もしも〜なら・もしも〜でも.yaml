        "part-of-speech": "adverb",

        "usage-context": "general use",
        "function": "To introduce a strong hypothetical condition.",
        "nuance": "Adds a sense of heightened uncertainty or a more dramatic 'what if' to the conditional clause. It implies a situation that may be unlikely, significant, or one the speaker is seriously contemplating."
    },
    "etymology": "「もしも」 is derived from 「もし」 (if), combined with the particle 「も」, which adds emphasis or the sense of \"even.\" While its literal meaning is \"even a bit,\" it primarily serves to strengthen the hypothetical nature of 「もし」.",
    "writeup": "「もしも」 functions as an adverb in Japanese, serving to emphasize the hypothetical nature of a statement. It strengthens the nuance of \"if\" or \"in the case that,\" often implying a higher degree of uncertainty or a more significant hypothetical scenario. This adverb is almost exclusively paired with various conditional expressions such as 〜なら, 〜ば, 〜と, 〜たら, or 〜ても, and it is typically placed at the beginning of a sentence or clause.\n\nWhile 「もし」 also conveys a hypothetical condition, the addition of 「も」 in 「もしも」 intensifies this meaning, suggesting a stronger sense of uncertainty, possibility, or even a dramatic \"what if\" scenario. This makes it particularly effective for situations where the outcome is less certain, more impactful, or when the speaker wishes to convey a heightened sense of speculation.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n*   「もしも」 is frequently used when discussing a potential *result* of a hypothetical situation. That is, if condition A is true, then outcome B will occur.\n*   In contrast, 「たとえ〜ても」 also expresses a hypothetical. However, it emphasizes that a certain outcome will happen *regardless* of the condition, or explores the consequence even in an unlikely scenario, rather than a direct result contingent on the hypothetical.",

            "nuance": "While both express hypothetical situations, 「たとえ〜ても」 emphasizes that an outcome will happen *regardless* of the condition, or explores the consequence in an unlikely scenario. 「もしも」, however, focuses on a direct result of a specific hypothetical condition, suggesting uncertainty or possibility of that condition occurring, and its outcome, rather than an outcome irrespective of the condition's likelihood or extreme nature of the condition itself, which is what 「たとえ」 emphasizes for."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「なら」 is a general conditional form that applies a condition to a statement. 「もしも〜なら」 adds a strong emphasis on the hypothetical nature of the condition, suggesting uncertainty or an unlikely possibility. It intensifies the conditional premise that precedes the consequence, making the conditional statement more impactful than simply using 「なら」 alone for more dramatic or uncertain scenarios."

            "nuance": "「もし」 also expresses a hypothetical condition, but 「もしも」 enhances this by adding greater emphasis and a stronger sense of uncertainty or possibility to the \"if\" clause. While often interchangeable in casual conversation, 「もしも」 is preferred when the hypothetical situation is more significant, uncertain, or when the speaker wishes to add a dramatic or emphatic tone to the conditional statement, emphasizing the possibility of that hypothetical situation occurring."

            "kind": "often confused with",
            "nuance": "While 「でも」 is used as part of the conditional 「〜ても」, on its own it acts as a particle meaning \"even,\" \"too,\" or \"or something.\" It does not introduce a hypothetical condition on its own, unlike 「もしも」. The common pitfall is to confuse the individual particle 「でも」 with its role within the broader 「もしも〜でも」 conditional construction. 「もしも〜でも」 emphasizes the hypothetical nature of the conditional clause, while 「でも」 alone focuses on inclusion or concession in a different context."

            "meaning": "If, When (conditional)",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「〜たら」 is a common conditional form that denotes a completed action or state leading to a consequence. 「もしも〜たら」 specifically emphasizes the hypothetical or unlikely nature of the initial condition. While 「〜たら」 can simply state a sequential condition, 「もしも〜たら」 adds a layer of speculation, suggesting that the speaker is contemplating a possibility that might not occur or is significant in its potential impact."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「もしも」 can be paired with various conditional forms, including 「なら」, 「たら」, and 「〜ても」, it is important to differentiate it from the individual particles or conjunctions. 「もしも」 explicitly introduces a hypothetical situation, emphasizing its speculative nature. Therefore, when you want to highlight the uncertainty or the significance of a hypothetical condition, 「もしも」 is the appropriate choice over simply using other conditional forms alone. Pay close attention to whether the intent is to state a general conditional or to emphasize the 'what if' aspect.",

            "etymology": "The use of 「もしも」 here enhances the hypothetical nature of the condition, emphasizing the 'what if' aspect of rain rather than a simple conditional statement about cause and effect.

            "nuance": "The combination of 「もしも」 and 「〜たら」 in this casual setting, especially when spoken by a younger male speaker, conveys a sense of dreaming or expressing a lighthearted fantasy. The use of 「行きたい」 reflects a personal desire, often shared among friends, further reinforcing the casual and aspirational tone. The emphasized hypothetical of 「もしも」 highlights the unlikely, dream-like nature of winning the lottery, making the desire for a world trip feel more like a personal fantasy.",
            "etymology": "The phrase 「もしも」 adds a layer of speculation to the conditional 「〜たら」, suggesting the speaker is contemplating a possibility that is quite unlikely, aligning with the aspirational nature of dreaming about winning a lottery.

            "etymology": "Here, 「もしも」 intensifies the concessive conditional 「〜としても」, highlighting the significant hypothetical of not having time. This makes the command more impactful, conveying that the task must be completed regardless of this challenging, yet considered, hypothetical."
