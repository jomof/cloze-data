    "etymology": "「ちゃんと」 and 「きちんと」 are both onomatopoeic adverbs. 「ちゃんと」 is thought to have originated from the sound of something being done firmly and reliably. 「きちんと」 has origins in the sound of something being perfectly aligned or orderly.",
    "writeup": "「ちゃんと」 and 「きちんと」 are 副詞 (adverbs) with very similar meanings: \"properly\" or \"neatly.\" They can modify an entire sentence or a specific verb.\n\nHistorically, 「ちゃんと」 also meant \"quickly,\" but this usage is rare today. Both terms imply doing something thoroughly and without laziness.",
