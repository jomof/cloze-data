    "etymology": "The expression 「に代わって」 is composed of the particle 「に」, which indicates the target or point of action; the verb 「代わる (かわる)」, meaning \"to substitute, to take the place of, to replace\"; and the 「て」-form, which connects it to the following clause. Historically, the 「に」 here denotes the location or object that undergoes replacement or substitution. The verb `代わる` (or its transitive counterpart `替える`) has always centered on the concept of exchange. The `て`-form provides a sequential or causal connection, allowing the preceding action of substitution to set the stage for the subsequent action.",
    "writeup": "「に代わって」 is a grammatical expression used with nouns to indicate that someone or something is acting **in place of** another, **on behalf of** another, or **succeeding** another. It conveys a sense of formal substitution or representation.\n\nThis expression is formed by combining a noun with the particle 「に」, followed by the `te`-form of the verb 「代わる (かわる)」. For example, 「父に代わって」 means \"in place of my father\" or \"on my father's behalf.\"\n\nA slightly more formal variant, 「に代わり」, is also frequently used, especially in written contexts or more polite speech, functioning as a conjunctive. While 「に代わって」 implies a direct action or state of substitution, 「に代わり」 serves to connect clauses, often introducing a new subject or action that takes the place of what came before.\n\n**Key nuances:**\n*   **Substitution/Replacement:** The core meaning revolves around one entity taking the role or position of another. This can be temporary or permanent.\n*   **Representation/On Behalf Of:** It is frequently used when someone acts as a representative for another person or organization, conveying a sense of responsibility or delegation.\n*   **Succession:** In some contexts, it can imply one thing being replaced by another in a continuous series, such as new technology replacing old.\n\n**Important considerations:**\n*   The entity being replaced (A) is marked by 「に」.\n*   The entity doing the replacing (B) is usually the subject of the following clause.\n*   The expression often implies a degree of authority, responsibility, or necessity in the substitution.",
