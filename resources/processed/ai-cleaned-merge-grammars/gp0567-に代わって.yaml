    "etymology": "The expression 「に代わって」 is composed of the particle 「に」, which indicates the target or point of action; the verb 「代わる (かわる)」, meaning \"to substitute, to take the place of, to replace\"; and the 「て」-form, which connects it to the following clause. Historically, the 「に」 here denotes the location or object that undergoes replacement or substitution. The verb `代わる` (or its transitive counterpart `替える`) has always centered on the concept of exchange. The `て`-form provides a sequential or causal connection, allowing the preceding action of substitution to set the stage for the subsequent action.",
    "writeup": "「に代わって」 is a grammatical expression used with nouns to indicate that someone or something is acting **in place of** another, **on behalf of** another, or **succeeding** another. It conveys a sense of formal substitution or representation.\n\nThis expression is formed by combining a noun with the particle 「に」, followed by the `te`-form of the verb 「代わる (かわる)」. For example, 「父に代わって」 means \"in place of my father\" or \"on my father's behalf.\"\n\nA slightly more formal variant, 「に代わり」, is also frequently used, especially in written contexts or more polite speech, functioning as a conjunctive. While 「に代わって」 implies a direct action or state of substitution, 「に代わり」 serves to connect clauses, often introducing a new subject or action that takes the place of what came before.\n\n**Key nuances:**\n*   **Substitution/Replacement:** The core meaning revolves around one entity taking the role or position of another. This can be temporary or permanent.\n*   **Representation/On Behalf Of:** It is frequently used when someone acts as a representative for another person or organization, conveying a sense of responsibility or delegation.\n*   **Succession:** In some contexts, it can imply one thing being replaced by another in a continuous series, such as new technology replacing old.\n\n**Important considerations:**\n*   The entity being replaced (A) is marked by 「に」.\n*   The entity doing the replacing (B) is usually the subject of the following clause.\n*   The expression often implies a degree of authority, responsibility, or necessity in the substitution.",

            "meaning": "Instead of, in place of, in exchange for",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While 「に代わって」 specifically emphasizes acting on behalf of someone or something, or one thing actively replacing another in a formal or established role, 「代わりに」 has a broader meaning of \"instead of\" or \"in exchange for.\" It can be used for simpler, less formal substitutions and exchanges without necessarily implying representation or succession."

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "Although both 「に代わって」 and 「代わりに」 can translate to \"in place of\" or \"instead of,\" their nuances differ. 「に代わって」 implies a formal or representative substitution, often carrying the weight of responsibility or a clear transfer of role, as when someone acts \"on behalf of\" a superior. In contrast, 「代わりに」 is more general and can describe a simple exchange or choice, such as \"eating rice instead of bread\" or \"doing A instead of B.\" While there can be overlap, remember to choose 「に代わって」 when the context involves acting as a formal representative or one thing actively taking the position of another.",
