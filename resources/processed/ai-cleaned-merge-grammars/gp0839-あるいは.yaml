    "etymology": "「あるいは」 comes from the verb 「或る」 (aru), meaning \"a certain\", the suffix 「い」 (i) used for making い-adjectives, and the adverbial particle 「は」 (wa). The literal sense is akin to \"another possibility.\"",
    "writeup": "「あるいは」 is a conjunction used to present alternatives or possibilities. It is more formal than 「または」 or 「それとも」. It often appears after a statement that ends with 「か」, indicating another possibility or option. 「あるいは」 can be translated as \"or,\" \"possibly,\" \"maybe,\" or \"perhaps.\" This expression carries a formal and somewhat stiff tone, making it suitable for academic, professional, or written contexts rather than casual conversation. Its etymology suggests a nuance of introducing 'a certain other' option.",
