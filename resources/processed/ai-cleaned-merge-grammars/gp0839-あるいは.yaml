    "etymology": "「あるいは」comes from combining 「或る (aru)」, meaning \"a certain,\" with the suffix 「い (i)」 used for creating い-adjectives, and the adverbial particle 「は (wa)」. Literally, it means something like \"another possibility.\"",
    "writeup": "「あるいは」is a conjunction used to present alternatives or possibilities. It often follows statements marked with the particle 「か」. While it can be translated as \"possibly,\" \"maybe,\" or \"or,\" it fundamentally highlights a certain element existing within the same category as something else. It indicates **another possibility** within a given context. It is considered a formal expression.",
