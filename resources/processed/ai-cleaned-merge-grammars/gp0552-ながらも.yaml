    "etymology": "ながらも is a combination of the conjunction particle ながら (meaning \"while\") and the adverbial particle も (meaning \"also\" or \"even\"). The kanji 乍ら suggests the nuance of 'while' is maintained.",
    "writeup": "ながらも is a combination of ながら and も. Derived from the kanji 乍ら, meaning \"while\", ながら almost always retains this nuance. Because of this, ながらも can be translated as \"even while (A), (B)\" or \"although (A), also (B)\". ながらも often expresses surprise at the coexistence of (A) and (B) and can be used after い-adjectives, な-adjectives, nouns, or the conjunctive form of verbs that describe states. ながらも highlights the thing that comes after the existing state of (A). Because of this, ながらも can only be used with verbs that highlight states of existence (like feelings) rather than ongoing actions. It is often used in more formal writing or speech.",
