    "etymology": "ながらも is derived from the particle ながら (meaning 'while') and the particle も (meaning 'also, even'). This combination creates a nuance of contrast or concession, expressing that something is true 'even though' something else is also true. The kanji 乍ら indicates 'while' and further emphasizes the concurrent nature of the two connected ideas. The addition of も intensifies this concessive meaning, highlighting a surprising or unexpected relationship between the two clauses.",
    "writeup": "**ながらも** combines the conjunction particle **ながら** and the adverbial particle **も**. Derived from the kanji 乍ら, which carries the meaning 'while,' **ながらも** typically retains this nuance. Therefore, it can be translated as 'even while (A), (B)' or 'although (A), also (B).' **ながらも** often expresses surprise at the coexistence of (A) and (B). It can follow い-adjectives, な-adjectives, nouns, or the ます stem or て-いる form of verbs. While it frequently applies to conditions or states (such as feelings or attributes), it can also be used with actions to emphasize an unexpected outcome or perseverance *despite* the action or the state it implies.",
