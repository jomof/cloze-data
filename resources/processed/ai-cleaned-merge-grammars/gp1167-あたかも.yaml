        "part-of-speech": "adverb",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Used to present a counterfactual statement emphatically, often with 「かのよう」.",

    "etymology": "The etymology of 「あたかも」 is debated. One theory suggests it comes from 「当に (atarini)」, meaning \"exactly\" or \"precisely,\" combined with 「も」, an emphatic particle. Another theory proposes it's related to 「値 (atai)」, meaning \"value\" or \"worth,\" suggesting a comparison to something of equal value or quality.",
    "writeup": "「あたかも」 is an adverb used to express that something is **just like** or **exactly like** something else, often in a way that is not actually true. It is predominantly used in formal writing and speech, lending a refined and emphatic tone to descriptions. It serves to highlight a hypothetical or counterfactual situation, making a comparison extremely vivid and impactful, almost to the point of illusion. While it can appear alone, 「あたかも」 is very commonly paired with 「かのよう」 (or its more literary counterpart 「かのごとし」) to reinforce the 'as if' meaning. The combination of 「あたかも～かのよう」 creates a powerful rhetorical effect, drawing a strong resemblance between two distinct entities or situations.",

The phrase 「力強いね」 (powerful, isn't it) enhances the sense of shared appreciation and informal tone, common among younger females. The use of 「あたかも」 adds an appreciative emphasis to the artwork's lifelike quality."

This reflects an older speaker in a professional setting, suitable for describing the advanced and almost unfathomable complexity of the technology to an academic audience. The structure 「自然現象の如く」 (like a natural phenomenon) emphasizes this advanced level of complexity."

It is much more colloquial and less formal than 「あたかも」."

While 「あたかも」 is formal, 「ごとき」 is even more so and belongs to a different stylistic register, often paired with 「あたかも」 in highly poetic or dramatic contexts to intensify the counterfactual comparison."
