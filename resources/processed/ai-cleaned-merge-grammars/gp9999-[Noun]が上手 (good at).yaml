jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: adjective
  register: teineigo (polite)
  function: Describes someone's skill or proficiency.
  nuance: Implies an objective assessment of skill. Crucially, it is typically used to praise **someone
    else's** ability. Using 『上手』 to describe one's own skills can sound boastful or arrogant, especially
    in Japanese culture where humility is valued. For self-description, 『得意 (とくい)』 (strong point, good
    at) or direct verb constructions are preferred. While `上手` is a な-adjective, when used in the `Noun
    が 上手 だ` construction, it behaves like an adjective describing the noun's proficiency in a skill.
etymology: The term 『上手 (じょうず)』 literally combines 『上 (じょう)』 meaning 'upper' or 'superior,' and 『手 (て)』
  meaning 'hand.' Historically, having the 'upper hand' signified skill, superiority, or being skilled
  at a task, often literally involving manual dexterity. This concept evolved to denote general proficiency
  or being 'good at' something. The 'hand' component is common in Japanese vocabulary related to ability,
  such as 『得意 (とくい)』 and 『苦手 (にがて)』, reflecting a connection to practical skill.
writeup: |-
  『上手 (じょうず)』 is a な-adjective used to describe someone's skill or proficiency in a particular area. It is commonly used with the particle 『が』 to mark the noun or nominalized verb representing the skill or activity one is good at. For example, 『料理が上手です』 means "They are good at cooking." If you want to say "They are good at singing," you would say 『歌を歌うのが上手です』, using 『歌うの』 to nominalize the verb "to sing."

  A key cultural nuance to remember is that 『上手』 is almost exclusively used when praising **someone else's** abilities. It is generally considered inappropriate or boastful to use 『上手』 to describe your own skills. Instead, if you want to say you are good at something, you would typically use 『得意 (とくい)』 or simply state that you can do it well without directly assessing your own skill (e.g., 『絵が描けます』 - "I can draw pictures").

  While 『上手』 describes skill, it can also sometimes be used to comment on the **appearance** of something (e.g., 『字が上手ですね』 - "Your handwriting is good"). However, its primary function is related to performance and ability. Pay attention to the distinction between 『上手』 and similar words like 『得意 (とくい)』 and 『下手 (へた)』, as their appropriate usage depends heavily on who is being described and the speaker's relationship to them.

  - term: 得意 (とくい)
    meaning: good at, strong point, favorite
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 『上手』, 『得意』 is typically used when talking about **one's own** strengths or preferred
      activities. It implies a personal aptitude or something one enjoys and is good at. It can also be
      used for others, but often carries a nuance of something being a person's 'strong suit' rather than
      just a general skill. For example, 『私は料理が得意です』 means "I am good at cooking (it's my strong point)."
    grammar_point: <suggest>:得意 (strong point)
  - term: 下手 (へた)
    meaning: poor at, unskillful
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 『下手』 is the direct antonym of 『上手』, meaning 'unskillful' or 'poor at.' Like 『上手』, it generally
      carries an objective assessment of skill and is commonly used for others. While less rude than using
      『上手』 for oneself, using 『下手』 for oneself is still common and often expresses humility, e.g., 『私は歌が下手です』
      (I am poor at singing).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:下手 (unskillful)
  - term: 苦手 (にがて)
    meaning: weak at, not good with, dislike
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 『苦手』 implies a personal aversion, dislike, or a struggle with something, rather than an objective
      lack of skill. You might say you are 『苦手』 at something if you find it difficult, unpleasant, or
      simply don't enjoy it. It can be used for oneself or others, e.g., 『私は数学が苦手です』 (I am bad at math
      / I struggle with math). It often implies a subjective feeling.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:苦手 (not good with)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'To summarize the distinctions: Use 『上手』 for praising others'' skills. Use
  『得意』 for your own skills or when speaking about someone''s particular strong suit. Use 『下手』 as the direct
  opposite of 『上手』 for describing objective lack of skill, often used humbly for oneself or objectively
  for others. Use 『苦手』 when you want to express a personal difficulty with or dislike of something, for
  yourself or others.'
examples:
  - english: My teacher is really good at playing the piano.
    japanese:
      - 先生 は ピアノ が {上手} です。
      - 先生 は ピアノ が {上手} だ。
    english_literally: Teacher, as for piano, is skillful.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 は ピアノ が {得意} です。
        english: My teacher is good at piano (it's their strong point).
        hint: While 『得意』 can also mean 'good at,' it often implies a personal strength or something one
          excels at. 『上手』 is more about general skill or objective performance. We're looking for a general
          assessment of skill.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 は ピアノ を {上手 に} 弾き ます。
        english: My teacher plays the piano skillfully.
        hint: This uses the adverbial form 『上手に』 to describe *how* the action is performed. The original
          grammar point describes the *person* as skillful. We're looking for the adjectival usage of
          'good at'.
    scene: A student is talking about their music teacher with a friend.

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 絵 を 描く の が {上手} です ね！
        english: You're really good at drawing pictures, aren't you!
        hint: This explicitly states the action 'drawing pictures'. The original is more concise, simply
          stating 'good at drawing'. We're looking for the concise noun form.
    scene: You see your friend's beautiful sketch and are impressed.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The 『ね』 at the end seeks agreement and softens the compliment. The use of 『上手』 here is natural
      as the speaker is praising the listener's ability directly.
  - english: I'm not good at speaking English.
    japanese:
      - 私 は 英語 を 話す の が {上手} で は あり ませ ん。
      - 私 は 英語 を 話す の が {上手} で は ない です。
      - 私 は 英語 を 話す の が {上手} じゃ ない です。
      - 私 は 英語 を 話す の が {上手} で は ない。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 英語 を 話す の が {苦手} です。
        english: I am not good at speaking English (I struggle with it).
        hint: 『苦手』 suggests a personal difficulty or aversion. 『上手ではない』 simply states a lack of skill.
          We're looking for a direct negation of skill.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 英語 を 話す の が {下手} です。
        english: I am unskillful at speaking English.
        hint: 『下手』 is the direct opposite of 『上手』 and is perfectly fine when describing one's own lack
          of skill in a humble way. However, 『上手ではない』 is also a common way to express this gently. We're
          looking for a common humble expression.
    scene: Someone is making an apology for their limited English speaking ability.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: apologetic
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: While 『上手』 is typically used for others, 『上手ではない』 or 『上手ではありません』 is an acceptable and common
      way to humbly state one's own lack of skill, avoiding the strong self-deprecating nuance of 『下手です』
      which might sound too harsh. The combination with 『私 は』 emphasizes the speaker's own situation.
      The use of 『話す の』 nominalizes the verb 'to speak'.

        english: He has skill in cooking.
        hint: This phrase literally means 'he has cooking arms/skill' and implies capability. 『上手だ』 is
          a direct assessment of skill. We're looking for the direct adjectival description.
    scene: Two friends gossiping about another friend's hidden talent.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female

      because it's a casual observation about someone else's skill. The male speaker uses plain form 『だ』.

        english: Despite her young age, she is very good at doing dance.

          stating 'good at dance'. We're looking for the concise form.
    scene: Watching a talented child performer.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 『幼い ながら も』 (while young) sets up a contrast. 『とても上手だ』 emphasizes a high degree of skill. This
      is a common way to express a child's exceptional talent. The plain form 『だ』 is appropriate for this
      casual, observational context.

          for an objective assessment, making 『得意』 less natural here.
    scene: A young man (artist) hesitantly asks for feedback from a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 『僕』 for 'I' is typical for young males. While using 『上手』 for oneself can be boastful,
      asking 'Am I good?' with 『上手だと思いますか？』 is acceptable as it's a humble inquiry seeking an objective
      opinion rather than a self-assertion. The particle 『と』 is used for quoting what one thinks.
  - english: He's good at everything, isn't he?
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 何 で も {上手} です ね。
      - 彼 は 何 で も {上手} だ ね。

    scene: Two people admiring a mutual acquaintance who seems to excel at everything.
    register: casual

      - 日本 語 が とても {上手} に なり まし た ね！

        english: You've become quite able to speak Japanese!

          the improvement in skill level. We're looking for the improvement in quality of speech.
    scene: A Japanese friend greets a foreign friend whom they haven't seen in a while.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    nuance: The 『に なりました』 construction shows a change from a previous state to being 『上手』. This is a very
      common and polite compliment to a Japanese learner. The 『ね』 softens the compliment and invites agreement.
