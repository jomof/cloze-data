    "etymology": "The particle 「は」 derives from the verb 「放つ(hanatsu)」, meaning 「to release」 or 「to emit」. Over time, its function evolved to highlight or contrast the topic it follows.",
    "writeup": "The 「は」 particle has two primary functions. The first, learned early on, marks the topic of a sentence. The second, and relevant here, highlights contrast (making a comparison). When 「は」 follows a number or counter, it commonly carries this comparison meaning, translating to \"or so\" or \"at least.\"\n\n「くらい」 or 「ぐらい」 often softens the statement before 「は」, further emphasizing the \"or so\" nuance. Though translated as \"at least,\" the comparative nature of 「は」 creates this nuance. The preceding number is emphasized, implying other amounts exist. It essentially suggests, \"As for (A), as opposed to (B),\" where (B) is usually unstated.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   「は」, when used this way, implies a minimum quantity or degree.\n*   Using 「くらい」 with 「は」 makes the statement less assertive.",
