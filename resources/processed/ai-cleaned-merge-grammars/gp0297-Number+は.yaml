        "function": "Emphasizes a number or quantity as a minimum, or implies a contrast with other possible amounts.",
        "nuance": "The core function of は here is to highlight contrast. It places emphasis on the preceding number, suggesting it is a minimum standard, an estimated lower bound, or a significant quantity relative to other unmentioned possibilities."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle は typically functions to mark the topic of a sentence or indicate contrast. When used after a number or counter, it takes on a contrasting meaning, similar to \"at least\" or \"or so.\" The nuance is comparative, implying other possibilities but emphasizing the stated quantity. Adding くらい (or ぐらい) before は softens the statement, suggesting an approximation.",
    "writeup": "The particle は generally marks the topic of a sentence. However, when used after a number or counter, it carries a contrasting meaning, often translated as \"at least\" or \"or so.\" This construction highlights the preceding quantity, implying that it is a minimum or a significant amount compared to other unstated possibilities. The presence of は suggests a contrast, even if the other side of the comparison is not explicitly mentioned. For instance, saying 「３つは」 (at least three) implies that while there might be more, three is the non-negotiable minimum or a noteworthy quantity. \n\nAdding くらい (or ぐらい) before は, as in 「数 + くらい / ぐらい + は」, softens the statement, giving it a sense of \"approximately at least.\" This lessens the directness of the assertion while still retaining the nuance of a minimum threshold. This grammar point is versatile and can be used in various contexts to express certainty about a minimum, an estimate, or to set a benchmark.",
