    "etymology": "The は particle generally marks the topic of a sentence or indicates contrast. Here, it emphasizes the number, implying a comparison or minimum expectation. The addition of くらい softens the assertion, suggesting approximation.",
    "writeup": "The particle は typically functions to mark the topic of a sentence. However, when used after a number or counter, it takes on a contrasting meaning, similar to \"at least\" or \"or so.\" The nuance is comparative, implying other possibilities but emphasizing the stated quantity. Adding くらい (or ぐらい) before は softens the statement, suggesting an approximation. While translatable as \"at least,\" は highlights a specific amount in contrast to other possible amounts, creating a sense of \"as opposed to (B),\" where (B) is often unstated.",
