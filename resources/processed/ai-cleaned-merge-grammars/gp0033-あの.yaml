    "etymology": "「あの」originates from the demonstrative series 「こ・そ・あ・ど」. 「あ」indicates something distant from both the speaker and the listener. It is related to 「あれ」 and 「あそこ」, which also denote things or places 'over there.'",
    "writeup": "「あの」is classified as a pre-noun adjectival (連体詞) in Japanese. These words do not conjugate, always appearing in the same form. 「あの」 comes from the 「こそあど」 family of words (demonstratives), and is used to identify a thing that is away from both the listener and the speaker. It's usually translated as \"that\" (thing over there). As the name 'pre-noun adjectival' suggests, these words always appear before a noun, modifying it.",
