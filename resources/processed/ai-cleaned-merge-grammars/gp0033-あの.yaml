        "usage-context": "To refer to something distant from both the speaker and the listener, often physically, but sometimes metaphorically (e.g., in memory or general knowledge).",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a determiner, always preceding a noun it modifies.",
        "spatial-flow": "Indicates distance, placing the modified noun out of immediate reach or clear proximity to both participants in a conversation, and often out of their shared immediate space or attention focus as well, implying something commonly known or recalled by both speakers from a shared past or distant context."
    },
    "etymology": "「あの」 originates from the demonstrative series 「こ・そ・あ・ど」. 「あ」 indicates something distant from both the speaker and the listener. It is related to 「あれ」 and 「あそこ」, which also denote things or places 'over there.' Its usage as an interjection likely stems from its original sense of 'pointing away' or 'referring to something distant,' which evolved into a linguistic pointer to gain attention or bridge thoughts.",
    "writeup": "「あの」 is classified as a pre-noun adjectival (連体詞 - rentaishi) in Japanese. These words do not conjugate, always appearing in the same form. Although functionally similar to English demonstrative adjectives like \"that,\" they belong to a distinct grammatical category in Japanese. 「あの」 comes from the 「こそあど」 family of words (demonstratives), and is used to identify a thing that is away from both the listener and the speaker. It's usually translated as \"that\" (thing over there). As the name 'pre-noun adjectival' suggests, these words always appear before a noun, modifying it. They function similarly to adjectives, directly preceding the noun they describe.\n\nBeyond its role as a pre-noun adjectival, 「あの」 also serves as a common interjection. In this capacity, it is used to gain someone's attention, to express hesitation, or to lead into a statement, much like \"um,\" \"uh,\" or \"excuse me\" in English. This dual function highlights the versatility of short Japanese words and how context dictates meaning.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The Japanese demonstratives form a system known as 'kosoado' (これ, それ, あれ, どれ; この, その, あの, どの; ここ, そこ, あそこ, どこ; etc.). It is essential to distinguish 「あの」, which modifies a noun far from both speaker and listener, from other demonstratives like 「この」 (near speaker), 「その」 (near listener), or their pronoun counterparts 「あれ」 (far from both). Furthermore, be mindful that 「あの」 can also function as an interjection, signaling hesitation or to draw attention, a distinct usage from its role as a noun modifier. Mastering the spatial relationships and contextual cues is key to their correct usage.",
