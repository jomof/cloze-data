    romaji: ha motoyori
  formation:
    Noun + はもとより: Indicates that something is true not only for the noun, but also for something else.
    Verb Phrase (Nominalized with の or こと) + はもとより: Indicates that something is true not only for the nominalized
      verb phrase, but also for something else.

  jlpt: N2
  details:
    part-of-speech: phrase
    register: formal
    usage-context: Used in formal writing and speech to indicate that something is true for a given element,
      and even more so for another element, or that a foundational truth extends to another aspect.
    function: Emphasizes an additional fact or inherent truth.
    nuance: 'The particle は highlights the initial element, もとより emphasizes the ''origin'' or ''base'' from
      which other truths extend. It can imply that the first fact is obvious or basic, while the second
      is a further implication. It has two main nuances: ''not only A, but also B'' and ''from the start/by
      nature A is B''.'
    grammatical-role: Connects two related statements or elements, showing an additive or foundational relationship.
  etymology: 'The phrase 「はもとより」 is composed of three elements: the topic particle 「は」 (ha), the noun 「元」
    (moto), meaning ''origin'' or ''base'', and the particle 「より」 (yori), meaning ''from'' or ''than''.
    Literally, it conveys a sense of ''from the origin'' or ''more than the base''. This etymology underpins
    its two main uses: the additive sense (''not only from the base/origin but also beyond'') and the inherent
    sense (''inherently, from the very beginning''). The combination evolved to express that a primary or
    obvious fact serves as a starting point for further implications or additional truths.'
  writeup: |-
    「はもとより」, often written in hiragana as はもとより, is a versatile grammatical expression that functions in two primary ways:

    1.  **"Not only A, but also B" (～だけでなく～も)**: This is the most common usage. It indicates that something applies to (A), and even more so, or additionally, to (B). The element (A) is often something obvious, basic, or expected, while (B) represents an extension or a more significant point. It serves to highlight the broader scope or additional applicability of a statement.
        *   It can attach to nouns directly.
        *   It can attach to verb phrases that have been nominalized using 「の」 or 「こと」.

    2.  **"From the start / By nature A is B" (最初から / 生来)**: In this less common but equally valid usage, 「はもとより」 emphasizes that a certain condition or truth is inherent, foundational, or has existed from the very beginning. It highlights the innate quality or initial state of something. The context usually makes it clear which meaning is intended. This meaning emphasizes a fundamental truth rather than an additive one.

    「はもとより」 carries a formal register and is more commonly found in written Japanese or formal spoken contexts. It is a more formal alternative to expressions like 「はもちろん」 or 「だけでなく」, lending a sense of weight and comprehensiveness to the statement.
  false_friends:
    - term: はもちろん
      meaning: Not only... but also; Let alone; Not to mention; Of course
      kind: synonym
      nuance: 「はもちろん」 is generally less formal than 「はもとより」 and can be used in a wider range of contexts.
        It often emphasizes that the first item is an obvious fact. While 「はもとより」 can convey a similar meaning,
        it has a more formal and somewhat literary feel, implying a foundational or inherent truth from
        which other facts extend.
      grammar_point: はもちろん (not only... but also)
    - term: だけでなく
      meaning: Not only ~ but ~ also; Not just ~ but ~ also
      kind: synonym
      nuance: 「だけでなく(て)〜も」 is a more common and versatile expression for 'not only... but also' and is less
        formal than 「はもとより」. It directly links two items in an additive way. 「はもとより」 can imply a more inherent
        or foundational relationship between the two items, often suggesting that the second item is a natural
        extension or consequence of the first.
      grammar_point: 〜ばかりでなく・〜だけでなく (not only... but also)
    - term: のみならず
      meaning: Not only... but also; Not just... but; What is more
      kind: synonym
      nuance: 「のみならず」 is a very formal and literary equivalent of 'not only... but also'. It is often used
        in written Japanese and has a strong sense of adding significant information. While similar in formality
        to 「はもとより」, 「のみならず」 tends to emphasize the addition of further, often equally important, information,
        whereas 「はもとより」 can also imply a foundational or inherent truth.
      grammar_point: はもとより・のみならず (not only・let alone)
    - term: に限らず
      meaning: Not just; Not only… but also
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「に限らず」 means 'not limited to' or 'not just' and emphasizes that something is true for a specific
        case and extends beyond it to other, similar cases. It focuses on the scope or inclusiveness. In
        contrast, 「はもとより」 explicitly states that something is true for one item and additionally for another,
        which may not necessarily be part of the same category, or it emphasizes an inherent truth.
      grammar_point: に限らず (not limited to)
    - term: ばかりでなく
      meaning: Not only…but also; As well as
      kind: synonym
      nuance: 「ばかりでなく」 is a common expression for 'not only... but also' and is generally less formal than
        「はもとより」. It highlights that something is true for one item, and then, in addition, for another.
        It can sometimes carry a nuance of surprise or emphasis on the second item. 「はもとより」, on the other
        hand, can also imply an inherent or foundational relationship, or that the first item is an obvious
        base from which the second truth extends.
      grammar_point: 〜ばかりでなく・〜だけでなく (not only... but also)
    - term: は言うまでもない
      meaning: It goes without saying (that), (It is) needless to say, I don't need to remind you
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「は言うまでもない」 emphasizes that something is so obvious or basic it doesn't need to be stated.
        While 「はもとより」 can convey a similar sense of foundational truth, it then typically extends to an
        additional, often less obvious, point. 「は言うまでもない」 primarily focuses on the self-evidence of a single
        point.
      grammar_point: は言うまでもない (goes without saying)
    - term: もさることながら
      meaning: Not only... but also; It goes without saying that... but even more so; It is a fact that...
        but
      kind: synonym
      nuance: 「もさることながら」 is also a formal expression meaning 'not only... but also', often with the nuance
        that the second point is even more significant or surprising than the first. 「はもとより」 emphasizes
        a 'from the origin' or 'inherent' aspect of the first point that leads to the second, making the
        second feel like a natural extension, whereas 「もさることながら」 might suggest a stronger contrast or added
        emphasis on the second element.
      grammar_point: もさることながら (not only・but more so)
  post_false_friends_writeup: While several expressions convey the idea of 'not only... but also' in Japanese,
    understanding their subtle differences in nuance and formality is crucial for precise communication.
    「はもとより」 stands out for its formal tone and its ability to imply either an additive relationship, where
    one fact is a clear extension of another, or to highlight an inherent, foundational truth. Expressions
    like 「はもちろん」 and 「だけでなく」 are more casual and broadly used, while 「のみならず」 and 「もさることながら」 maintain a high
    degree of formality, often used in written Japanese, with the latter often emphasizing the second point
    as even more significant. 「に限らず」 emphasizes broader applicability, and 「ばかりでなく」 tends to highlight additional
    surprising facts. Lastly, 「は言うまでもない」 focuses on the self-evidence of a statement. Choosing the appropriate
    expression depends on the desired level of formality, the specific relationship between the two elements,
    and whether an inherent truth is being conveyed.

          hint: 「だけでなく」 is a more general expression for 'not only...but also' and is less formal. 「はもとより」

            splendid and worth seeing.

          english: This restaurant is famous not just for its delicious food, but also for its excellent
            service.
          hint: 「だけでなく」 is a common, direct way to express 'not only... but also', suitable for general
            conversation. 「はもとより」 adds a more formal tone, suggesting that good service naturally extends
            from the restaurant's reputation for delicious food. We're looking for a formal way to express
            multiple reasons for fame.

          english: This restaurant is famous for its delicious food of course, but also for its excellent
            service.
          hint: 「もちろん」 implies the first point is obvious. 「はもとより」 conveys a more nuanced sense, indicating
            that the service excellence is an inherent aspect of the restaurant's overall quality, often
            implying it's a natural progression from the food. We're looking for a formal phrase that implies
            the second quality is a natural extension of the first.

          english: The city's development aims not just for economic growth, but also for environmental
            sustainability.
          hint: 「だけでなく」 is a general additive expression. 「はもとより」 conveys a more comprehensive and formal
            tone, implying that sustainability is a fundamental goal, naturally arising alongside economic
            growth. We're looking for a formal way to describe intertwined development goals.

          hint: 「のみならず」 is also highly formal, but it tends to emphasize adding further, often equally important,
            information. 「はもとより」 suggests that environmental sustainability is an inherent and foundational
            aspect of the development, not just an added goal. We're looking for a formal expression that
            highlights a foundational approach.

  post_example_writeup: The examples provided illustrate both the 'not only... but also' and 'from the start/by
    nature' nuances of 「はもとより」. Notice how the usage is consistently formal, often appearing in contexts
    such as academic discussions, professional presentations, or critical analyses. This reflects its function
    in adding weight and and comprehensiveness to statements, making it suitable when precision and a nuanced
    understanding are required. The first six examples demonstrate the additive sense, where the second
    point (e.g., the interior's splendor, an actor's character, economic benefits) is presented as an additional,
    important aspect to the initial one. The seventh example, "From the start, I believed...", specifically
    highlights the 'from the start/by nature' meaning, where the speaker's belief in the individual's ability
    to inspire was inherent and present from the very beginning of their assessment. The final examples
    continue to showcase the additive sense, demonstrating multifaceted aspects in restaurant quality and
    urban development. This consistent formality and the clear distinction between the two nuances are key
    to mastering 「はもとより」.

  details:
    part-of-speech: phrase
    register: formal
    usage-context: Very formal, stiff
    function: Adds an additional aspect or consequence to a preceding statement.
    nuance: Emphasizes that something is true for one aspect, and additionally true for another, often more
      significant or unexpected, aspect. Carries a formal or literary tone.
  etymology: 「のみならず」 is derived from 「のみ」 (only), the negative form of the verb 「なる」 (naru, to become) which
    is 「なら」, and the auxiliary verb 「ず」 (zu, not). Literally, it implies 'not only that it becomes [A],
    but also [B]'.
  writeup: '「のみならず」 is a formal expression used to indicate that something is "not only A, but also B."
    It serves a similar function to 「だけでなく」 or 「ばかりでなく」, but carries a significantly more formal and literary
    tone. Its usage is typically restricted to written language, formal speeches, or academic discourse,
    making it less common in casual conversation. This grammar point can connect to various parts of speech:
    Nouns: It attaches directly to nouns, or to nouns followed by 「である」. Verbs: It connects to verbs in
    their plain forms (dictionary form, negative plain, past plain, negative past plain). い-adjectives:
    It attaches to い-adjectives in their plain forms (dictionary form, past plain). な-adjectives: It attaches
    to な-adjectives in their plain forms (e.g., 静かなのみならず). Additionally, 「のみならず」 can function as a conjunction,
    appearing at the beginning of a new sentence. In this role, it means "furthermore," "moreover," or "what''s
    more," adding a subsequent point or elaboration to a previous statement. Due to its inherent formality,
    it should be chosen carefully to match the appropriate register of communication. It signals a more
    elevated or authoritative tone compared to its less formal counterparts.'

    - term: ばかりでなく
      meaning: Not only...but also, As well as
      kind: synonym
      nuance: 「ばかりでなく」 is less formal than 「のみならず」. Use it when you want to sound less stiff. It often implies
        the second item is an additional benefit or drawback.
      grammar_point: 〜ばかりでなく・〜だけでなく (not only... but also)
    - term: だけでなく
      meaning: Not only... but also

    - term: に限らず
      meaning: Not just, Not only… but also
      kind: synonym
      nuance: 「に限らず」 often implies a wider scope or that something applies to more than just the specified
        category, suggesting a lack of limitation. This is subtly different from 「のみならず」's direct addition
        of another element.
      grammar_point: に限らず (not limited to)
    - term: だけでなく(て)〜も
      meaning: Not only ~ but ~ also, Not just ~ but ~ also

      nuance: This pattern explicitly emphasizes the second part (も) more strongly, often highlighting its
        unexpected or additional significance. While similar, 「のみならず」 has a more formal, literary feel.

    - term: はもとより
      meaning: Not only... but also, Let alone, Of course,
      kind: synonym
      nuance: 「はもとより」 implies that the first item is obvious or expected, adding a nuance of 'of course'
        or 'needless to say'. It's more about acknowledging an obvious fact and then adding something further,
        whereas 「のみならず」 simply adds a parallel point.
      grammar_point: はもとより・のみならず (not only・let alone)
    - term: だけ
      meaning: Only, Just
      kind: often confused with
      nuance: 「だけ」 means 'only' or 'just', serving as a limiter. 「のみならず」 means 'not only... but also', expressing
        expansion. Pay close attention to the presence of 「ならず」 (not only that it becomes) which negates
        the limiting sense of 「のみ」.
      grammar_point: だけ (only・just)
  post_false_friends_writeup: While 「ばかりでなく」, 「だけでなく」, 「に限らず」, 「だけでなく(て)〜も」, and 「はもとより」 share similar meanings
    with 「のみならず」, they have subtle differences in nuance and formality. 「ばかりでなく」 and 「だけでなく」 are considerably
    less formal and more common in everyday conversation. 「に限らず」 implies a broader application or scope.
    「はもとより」 suggests the first item is an obvious given. Understanding these nuances will help you choose
    the most appropriate expression for your intended meaning and context. Take care not to confuse with
    「だけ」, which means 「only」 and is a restrictive particle.

        - 地震 は 建物 を 破壊 する {のみ なら ず}、人々 の 心 に も 深い 傷跡 を 残す。

          english: Earthquakes not only destroy buildings, but also leave deep scars on people's hearts.
          hint: While 「だけでなく」 conveys a similar meaning, 「のみならず」 adds a more formal and literary tone, suitable
            for serious, informative contexts like this. We're looking for a formal expression to emphasize
            both impacts.
      scene: A journalist writing an article about the long-term impact of natural disasters.
      register: formal
      setting: informative
      nuance: The sentence employs formal vocabulary like 「破壊 する」 (to destroy) and 「深い 傷 を 残す」 (to leave
        deep scars), which are typical in journalistic or academic writing. The use of 「のみならず」 reinforces
        the seriousness of the topic, making the statement sound authoritative and impactful. The example
        uses the verb plain form formation.
      etymology: The phrase 「深い 傷 を 残す」 (fukai kizu o nokosu) literally means 'to leave deep wounds,' and
        is a common idiomatic expression used to describe lasting emotional or psychological damage, drawing
        a parallel to physical scars left on the body. This evokes a strong emotional response, fitting
        for a formal article discussing the impact of natural disasters beyond just physical destruction.
    - english: This mountain trail is not only steep but also has many dangerous sections, so caution is

          english: This mountain trail is not only steep, but also has many dangerous sections, so caution
            is necessary.
          hint: 「だけでなく」 is a more common and versatile expression for 'not only... but also' in everyday
            conversation than the formal 「のみならず」. We're looking for a formal way to state the dangers.
      scene: A hiking guide briefing a group of tourists before they embark on a challenging trail.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: instructional
      nuance: The usage of 「〜です」 for politeness while still maintaining a formal tone with 「のみならず」 makes
        this suitable for a guide addressing tourists. The phrase 「注意 が 必要 です」 (caution is necessary) further
        reinforces the instructional and cautionary nature. This example demonstrates the な-adjective plain
        form formation. The alternative uses 「多々 ある」 and 「注意 を 要する」 for a slightly more formal nuance.
      etymology: 「注意 が 必要」 (chūi ga hitsuyō) is a common fixed expression meaning 'caution is necessary'
        or 'attention is required.' Its origin is straightforward, combining 「注意」 (attention/caution) and
        「必要」 (necessity), forming a direct and unambiguous warning, which is crucial in instructional contexts
        like a hiking brief.
    - english: He not only continues to study every day but also achieves excellent results in sports.

          english: He not only continues to study every day, but also achieves excellent results in sports.
          hint: While 「ばかりでなく」 is a valid alternative, 「のみならず」 is preferred in formal or academic contexts
            to highlight comprehensive excellence. We're looking for a formal expression suitable for an
            academic report.
      scene: A teacher discussing a student's exemplary performance during a parent-teacher conference.
      register: formal
      setting: academic
      nuance: This sentence highlights exceptional performance using the formal expression 「素晴らしい 成果 を 出している」
        (achieving excellent results). The use of 「のみならず」 reinforces the comprehensive nature of the student's
        talents, appropriate for an academic report or discussion. This example uses the verb plain form
        formation. The alternative uses 「励む」 (to strive) and 「収める」 (to obtain) for a more elevated academic
        tone.
      etymology: The phrase 「成果 を 出す」 (seika o dasu) meaning 'to achieve results' or 'to produce results'
        is a standard formal expression. 「成果」 (seika) implies 'fruitful results' or 'achievements', often
        used in academic, business, or sports contexts to denote concrete, positive outcomes, reflecting
        a serious assessment of performance.
    - english: She is not only a famous singer but also actively engaged in social contribution activities.

          english: She is a famous singer. Moreover, she is also actively engaged in social contribution
            activities.
          hint: 「その 上」 functions as a conjunction meaning 'moreover' or 'in addition,' but it separates
            the two ideas more distinctly. 「のみならず」 directly links them as a single expanding statement.
            We're looking for a phrase that tightly connects the two aspects.
      scene: A speaker introducing a prominent public figure at a formal charity event.
      register: formal
      setting: professional
      nuance: The sentence begins with the formal 「彼女 は」 (she is) and uses 「熱心 に 取り組んでいる」 (actively engaged
        in) which conveys dedication. The combination of 「〜である のみならず」 presents both aspects of her public
        life with equal emphasis and a high degree of formality, suitable for a public address. This example
        uses the Noun + である formation. The alternative uses 「意欲 的 に 従事 し て いる」 for a more proactive and
        professional nuance.
      etymology: 「社会 貢献 活動」 (shakai kōken katsudō) is a compound noun meaning 'social contribution activities'.
        It's a relatively modern term that reflects increased corporate and individual engagement in philanthropy
        and community service. The precision of this term highlights the formality and specific nature of
        the activities being described, appropriate for a formal introduction.
    - english: This problem is complicated. What's more, solving it will likely cost a great deal of money.
      japanese:
        - この 問題 は 複雑 だ。{のみ なら ず}、解決 する に は 多額 の 費用 が かかる だろう。
        - この 問題 は 複雑 で ある。{のみ なら ず}、解決 に は 膨大 な 費用 を 要する だろう。

          english: This problem is complicated. And, solving it will likely cost a great deal of money.
          hint: 「そして」 is a general 'and' or 'then' conjunction. 「のみならず」 in this conjunctive usage specifically
            emphasizes the addition of a significant, often unexpected, secondary point in a formal tone.
            We're looking for a formal conjunction to emphasize the added burden.
      scene: A manager presenting a difficult project status report to company executives.
      register: bijinesu nihongo (business)
      setting: professional
      nuance: The sentence structure clearly separates two points using 「のみならず」 as a conjunctive device,
        a common feature in formal reports or speeches. The word 「多額」 (a large sum) further contributes
        to the formal and serious tone, underscoring the financial implications for the business. This example
        demonstrates the conjunctive formation. The alternative uses 「複雑 で ある」, 「膨大」, and 「要する」 for an even
        higher level of formality often found in written reports.
      etymology: 「多額 の 費用」 (tagaku no hiyō) refers to 'a large sum of money for expenses.' 「多額」 is a formal
        word for 'large amount,' emphasizing the significant financial burden. This choice of vocabulary
        reinforces the gravity of the issue being discussed in a business context, indicating a substantial
        and perhaps problematic cost.
    - english: The performance was not only technically brilliant but also deeply moving, captivating the

        - その 演奏 は 技術 的 に 優れ て い た {のみ なら ず}、聴衆 の 心 を 掴む ほど 感動 的 で あっ た。

        enough to captivate the entire audience.

          english: That performance was technically brilliant. Furthermore, it was deeply moving, captivating
            the entire audience.
          hint: 「さらに」 introduces an additional point, but 「のみならず」 creates a tighter connection between the
            two qualities, emphasizing that both were true of the performance. We're looking for a way to
            show that both qualities were simultaneously present.
      scene: A music critic writing a review of a classical concert.
      register: formal
      setting: creative
      nuance: This example uses a noun + である implicit in 「秀逸 であった」. The adjectives 「秀逸」 (excellent) and
        「感動 的」 (moving) combined with 「魅了 する」 (to captivate) are typical of literary or critical discourse.
        The formal tone of 「のみならず」 suits a sophisticated review. The alternative uses 「優れて いた」 (was excellent)
        and 「心 を 掴む」 (to grab one's heart), which are also natural and formal ways to express similar sentiments.
      etymology: 「秀逸」 (shūitsu) means 'excellent' or 'superb', often used in artistic or academic contexts
        to denote outstanding quality. 「聴衆 を 魅了 する」 (chōshū o miryō suru) means 'to captivate the audience',
        a common idiom in performance reviews, emphasizing the powerful effect on listeners. The combination
        elevates the description beyond simple praise.
    - english: The new policy not only aims to reduce costs but also to improve employee well-being.
      japanese:

          english: The new policy not only aims to reduce costs but also to improve employee well-being.
          hint: While 「ばかりでなく」 conveys a similar meaning, 「のみならず」 gives the statement a more official and
            authoritative tone, suitable for policy descriptions or formal announcements. We need a formal
            phrase for a policy statement.
      scene: A human resources manager explaining a new company policy to employees.
      register: formal
      setting: informative
      nuance: The technical terms 「コスト 削減」 (cost reduction) and 「福利 厚生」 (employee well-being) are characteristic
        of business and policy discussions. The verb 「目指す」 (to aim for) followed by 「のみならず」 precisely conveys
        the dual objectives of the policy in a formal manner. This uses the verb plain form. The alternative
        uses 「図る」 and 「意図 し て いる」 which are slightly more formal business terms, making the nuance even
        more precise and official.
      etymology: 「福利 厚生」 (fukuri kōsei) is a common compound noun in Japanese business and legal contexts,
        referring specifically to employee benefits and welfare. Its inclusion highlights the comprehensive
        nature of the policy, extending beyond mere financial considerations to encompass employee well-being.
    - english: The ancient city was not only a center of trade but also flourished as a hub of culture and

          english: The ancient city was a center of trade. Also, it flourished as a hub of culture and learning.
          hint: 「また」 simply adds another point. 「のみならず」 emphasizes that the city excelled in both aspects,
            giving a more cohesive and impactful statement suitable for academic writing. We're looking
            for a phrase to highlight dual excellence.
      scene: A historian lecturing on the characteristics of ancient civilizations.
      register: formal
      setting: informative
      nuance: This sentence employs vocabulary common in historical and academic discourse, such as 「古代
        都市」 (ancient city), 「交易」 (trade), 「学問」 (learning), and 「栄えた」 (flourished). The 「〜であった のみならず」 construction
        is fitting for describing historical facts with authority. This uses the Noun + である のみならず formation.
        The alternative uses 「学術」 (scholarship) and 「繁栄 した」 (prospered) for a slightly different academic
        phrasing, further emphasizing the city's intellectual and cultural significance.
      etymology: 「拠点」 (kyoten) means 'base' or 'hub', often used to describe a central point for activity.
        In this context, it signifies the city's role as a nexus for cultural and scholarly pursuits, conveying
        its historical importance beyond just economic activity.
    - english: He was not only talented but also diligent, which led to his rapid success.
      japanese:
        - 彼 は 才能 が あっ た {のみ なら ず}、勤勉 で も あっ た の で、急速 に 成功 を 収め た。
        - 彼 は 才能 豊か で あっ た {のみ なら ず}、大変 勤勉 で あっ た の で、目覚ましい 成功 を 遂げ た。
      english_literally: As for him, not only being talented, but also being diligent, so he achieved rapid
        success.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 は 才能 が あっ た {だけ で なく}、勤勉 で も あっ た の で、急速 に 成功 を 収め た。
          english: He was not only talented but also diligent, which led to his rapid success.
          hint: 「だけでなく」 is common, but 「のみならず」 enhances the formality and emphasizes the combination of
            these two significant qualities as contributing factors to his success. We need a formal way
            to describe his double strengths.
      scene: A mentor speaking about the qualities of a successful protégé during an award ceremony.
      register: formal
      setting: inspirational
      nuance: This example highlights the combination of positive attributes using an い-adjective (才能 が
        あっ た) followed by のみならず (in this case, past tense of ある). The phrase 「急速 に 成功 を 収め た」 (achieved
        rapid success) adds to the formal and laudatory tone. The alternative uses 「才能 豊か であった」 (was abundantly
        talented) and 「目覚ましい 成功 を 遂げ た」 (achieved striking success) for a more elaborate and inspiring tone,
        suitable for an award speech.
      etymology: 「勤勉」 (kinben) means 'diligence' or 'industry', a virtue highly valued in Japanese society,
        often associated with hard work and perseverance. The phrase 「成功 を 収める」 (seikō o osameru) means
        'to achieve success', a formal expression for reaching a desired outcome or goal.
    - english: The proposal was not only logical but also presented in a highly persuasive manner, gaining
        unanimous approval.
      japanese:
        - その 提案 は 論理 的 で あっ た {のみ なら ず}、極めて 説得 力 ある 形 で 提示 さ れ、満場 一致 で 承認 さ れ た。
        - その 提案 は 論理 的 で あっ た {のみ なら ず}、非常 に 説得 力 の ある 仕方 で 提示 さ れ、全員 の 賛同 を 得 た。
      english_literally: That proposal, not only being logical, but also presented in a highly persuasive
        manner, and was unanimously approved.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - その 提案 は 論理 的 だっ た。{しかも}、極めて 説得 力 ある 形 で 提示 さ れ、満場 一致 で 承認 さ れ た。
          english: The proposal was logical. Moreover, it was presented in a highly persuasive manner, gaining
            unanimous approval.
          hint: 「しかも」 often implies 'what's more' or 'and yet' with a slightly surprising or added positive/negative
            nuance. 「のみならず」 maintains a more neutral, formal addition of two significant qualities. We need
            to formally connect both positive aspects.
      scene: A board member describing a successful proposal during a corporate meeting.
      register: formal
      setting: persuasive
      nuance: This example uses the な-adjective (論理 的) with である followed by 「のみならず」. Phrases like 「説得 力
        ある 形」 (persuasive manner) and 「満場 一致 で 承認 された」 (unanimously approved) are common in formal business
        or academic contexts, emphasizing the quality of the proposal and its reception. The alternative
        uses 「非常 に 説得 力 の ある 仕方 で」 (in a very persuasive way) and 「全員 の 賛同 を 得た」 (gained everyone's approval)
        for stylistic variation in formal communication.
      etymology: 「満場 一致」 (manjō itchi) literally means 'entire hall agreement' or 'unanimous', used in formal
        settings like meetings or assemblies to denote complete consensus. 「承認」 (shōnin) means 'approval'
        or 'endorsement', a formal term for officially accepting something.
  post_example_writeup: The examples above showcase how 「のみならず」 is used to connect two related but distinct
    qualities or facts across various registers and settings. Remember that while the core meaning implies
    formality, the nuances of surrounding words and particles allow for expression in more intimate or specific
    contexts. Its formal nature makes it particularly suitable for written reports, academic papers, and
    official speeches, where a precise and elevated tone is desired.
