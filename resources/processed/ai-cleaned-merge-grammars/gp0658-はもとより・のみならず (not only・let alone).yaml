details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  function: Indicates that something is true not only for the preceding item but also for another, often
    more significant or surprising, item. It expands the scope of a statement.
  nuance: はもとより implies that the first item is a given or obvious, and the second item is an additional,
    often more noteworthy, point. のみならず is more formal and assertive, emphasizing that the statement extends
    beyond the first item, often suggesting an additive or comprehensive nature.
etymology: 「はもとより」combines the topic particle 「は」 with 「元より」 (motoyori), meaning 'originally' or 'from
  the first.' Thus, it signifies 'from the first, it is natural that A is true, and moreover B is also
  true.' 「のみならず」is composed of 「のみ」 (only), a classical equivalent of 「だけ」, and 「ならず」, the classical negative
  form of 「なる」 (to be/become). Literally, it means 'not merely being,' hence 'not only A, but also B.'
  Both expressions highlight an expansion beyond an initial premise, with roots in older forms of Japanese.
writeup: "「はもとより」 and 「のみならず」 are grammar patterns used to express 'not only X, but also Y.' They indicate\
  \ that a statement is true for X, and furthermore, it is also true for Y, with Y often being a more\
  \ significant, surprising, or expected extension of the statement than X. \n\n「はもとより」 (Ha motoyori)\
  \ literally means 'from the beginning' or 'originally.' When used in this pattern, it implies that the\
  \ first item (X) is already understood or expected to be true, and the second item (Y) is an additional\
  \ fact that holds true, often to an even greater degree. It's frequently used when discussing a range\
  \ of things, from basic to more advanced, or simple to complex. It can be used with nouns, plain verb\
  \ forms, and plain i-adjective forms, and with な-adjectives using 「である」. While formal, it can occasionally\
  \ appear in slightly less rigid contexts than 「のみならず」.\n\n「のみならず」 (Nominarazu) is a more formal and\
  \ somewhat literary expression. It consists of 「のみ」 (meaning 'only' or 'nothing but') and the classical\
  \ negative 「ならず」 (meaning 'not being' or 'not becoming'). The literal interpretation is 'not merely\
  \ being X,' leading to the meaning 'not only X, but also Y.' This pattern strongly emphasizes the comprehensive\
  \ nature of the statement, asserting that its truth extends beyond the initial point to include other\
  \ aspects. It is suitable for more formal writing and speeches. \n\nBoth phrases convey a similar core\
  \ meaning, but 「のみならず」 generally carries a stronger and more formal tone, often implying a broader scope\
  \ or a more significant addition than 「はもとより」. When choosing between the two, consider the level of\
  \ formality and the desired emphasis on the additional item."

  - term: 〜ばかりでなく・〜だけでなく
    meaning: Not only... but also
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ばかりでなく」 and 「だけでなく」 are more general and less formal ways to express 'not only... but also.'
      They don't carry the strong implication that the latter item is more significant or self-evident
      than the former, which 「はもとより」 often does. 「のみならず」 is generally more formal than these.
    grammar_point: 〜ばかりでなく・〜だけでなく (not only... but also)
  - term: はもちろん
    meaning: Of course; needless to say; not to mention
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「はもちろん」 strongly implies that the first item is obvious and goes without saying. While it
      also means 'not only... but also,' it puts more emphasis on the given nature of the first item,
      whereas 「はもとより」 and 「のみならず」 focus more on extending the scope from the first item to the second,
      which can be less obvious or more impactful. 「はもとより」 is often interchangeable with 「はもちろん」, but
      「のみならず」 is generally more formal and less focused on obviousness.
    grammar_point: はもちろん (not only... but also)
  - term: さえ
    meaning: Even
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「さえ」 emphasizes an extreme or unexpected case, meaning 'even X.' While it can be used to highlight
      an additional item, it doesn't build on a 'not only... but also' structure in the same way. It typically
      highlights the minimum or surprising maximum scope, rather than expanding from a known truth.
    grammar_point: さえ (even・if only)
  - term: すら
    meaning: Even (with negative nuance)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「さえ」, 「すら」 means 'even,' but often carries a more negative or critical nuance,
      implying 'even X (which is surprising or undesirable).' It is also used for emphasizing an extreme
      case rather than a general expansion from 'not only... but also.'
    grammar_point: すら (even)
post_false_friends_writeup: While all these expressions can relate to adding information or emphasizing
  scope, 「はもとより・のみならず」 specifically highlight that something is true for a given item AND extends to another,
  often more significant, item. 「ばかりでなく」 and 「だけでなく」 are more neutral additions. 「はもちろん」 emphasizes the
  obviousness of the first item. 「さえ」 and 「すら」 are purely emphatic, focusing on the unexpectedness of
  'even' a particular item.
examples:
  - english: She is good at cooking, and singing as well.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 料理 {は もとより}、歌 も 上手 だ。
      - 彼女 は 料理 {のみ なら ず}、歌 も 上手 だ。
    english_literally: As for her, cooking, naturally, and singing also is skillful.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 料理 が 上手 な {だけ で なく}、歌 も 上手 だ。
        english: She is not only good at cooking but also good at singing.
        hint: While similar, 「だけでなく」 is a more neutral addition. 「はもとより」 implies her cooking skill is
          a given, and her singing is an added bonus. We're looking for an expression that suggests 'not
          only X, but also Y'.
    scene: A teacher is praising a student's various talents.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: The use of 「はもとより」 suggests that her cooking skill is already known or expected, and her singing
      ability is an additional, perhaps surprising, talent. 「のみならず」 would also work here with a slightly
      more formal feel.
  - english: The new policy affects not only large companies but also small and medium-sized enterprises.
    japanese:
      - 新しい 政策 は、大 企業 {は もとより}、中 小 企業 に も 影響 を 与える。
      - 新しい 政策 は、大 企業 {のみ なら ず}、中 小 企業 に も 影響 を 与える。
    english_literally: New policy, large companies, naturally, small and medium enterprises also affects.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新しい 政策 は、大 企業 に {は もちろん}、中 小 企業 に も 影響 を 与える。
        english: The new policy affects large companies, of course, and also small and medium-sized enterprises.
        hint: 「はもちろん」 emphasizes that the effect on large companies is obvious. While similar, 「はもとより」
          here focuses on extending the impact from large companies to smaller ones. We're looking for
          an expression that expands the scope.
    scene: A business analyst is explaining the broad impact of a new government policy.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「はもとより」 indicates that the impact on large companies is a primary or expected consequence,
      but the policy's reach extends further to SMEs. 「のみならず」 here would emphasize the comprehensive nature
      of the policy's impact.
  - english: This software is easy to use, and its functions are excellent as well.
    japanese:
      - この ソフト は 使い やすい {は もとより}、機能 も 優れ て いる。
      - この ソフト は 使い やすい {のみ なら ず}、機能 も 優れ て いる。
    english_literally: This software is easy to use, naturally, its functions also are excellent.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この ソフト は 使い やすい。{それ に} 機能 も 優れ て いる。
        english: This software is easy to use. And its functions are excellent.
        hint: 「それに」 is a simple 'and' or 'in addition.' We need a phrase that conveys 'not only... but
          also,' implying a higher level of quality or feature beyond the initial one. The current sentence
          implies that ease of use is a given, and the excellent functions are an added bonus.
    scene: A tech reviewer is giving a positive review of a new software.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: Using 「はもとより」 emphasizes that being user-friendly is a basic, expected quality, and the outstanding
      functions are an additional, significant plus. 「のみならず」 maintains this additive nuance with higher
      formality.
  - english: He can speak English, and French as well.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 英語 が 話せる {は もとより}、フランス 語 も 話せる。
      - 彼 は 英語 が 話せる {のみ なら ず}、フランス 語 も 話せる。
    english_literally: As for him, English can be spoken, naturally, French also can be spoken.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 英語 が 話せる {ばかり か}、フランス 語 も 話せる。
        english: Not only can he speak English, but he can also speak French.
        hint: 「ばかりか」 is a very common 'not only... but also' form. 「はもとより」 and 「のみならず」 offer a more formal
          or slightly more nuanced way of expressing this, suggesting that English is a given, and French
          is an impressive addition. The emphasis is on expansion beyond the initial statement.
    scene: Two colleagues are discussing a new team member's qualifications.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「はもとより」 indicates that English proficiency is expected, and French proficiency is an added,
      notable skill. 「のみならず」 offers a slightly more formal and strong assertion of this additional skill.
  - english: That restaurant is popular with adults, and with children too.
    japanese:
      - あの レストラン は 大人 {は もとより}、子供 に も 人気 が ある。
      - あの レストラン は 大人 {のみ なら ず}、子供 に も 人気 が ある。
    english_literally: That restaurant, adults, naturally, children also popularity has.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの レストラン は 大人 も 人気 が ある。{それ に} 子供 に も 人気 が ある。
        english: That restaurant is popular with adults. In addition, it's popular with children.
        hint: 「それに」 simply adds another piece of information. We need an expression that links the two
          popularity points, suggesting that popularity with children is an extension of its general appeal,
          building upon its popularity with adults.
    scene: A family is deciding where to eat.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: While the register is casual for the scene, the grammar pattern itself lends a slightly elevated
      tone, indicating that popularity with adults is expected, and popularity with children is an additional,
      perhaps surprising, positive point. 「はもとより」 is chosen for its versatility in this context.
  - english: This car is expensive, and maintenance costs are high as well.
    japanese:
      - この 車 は 値段 が 高い {は もとより}、維持 費 も かかる。
      - この 車 は 値段 が 高い {のみ なら ず}、維持 費 も かかる。
    english_literally: This car, price is high, naturally, maintenance costs also takes time.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 車 は 値段 が 高い。{その 上} 維持 費 も かかる。
        english: This car is expensive. On top of that, maintenance costs are high.
        hint: 「その上」 is a simple 'on top of that.' We need a construction that expresses 'not only X, but
          also Y,' implying that the high price is just the beginning of the expenses.
    scene: Someone is complaining about the cost of car ownership.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: Using 「はもとより」 conveys that the high purchase price is an initial drawback, and the high maintenance
      cost is an additional, equally significant, negative point. 「のみならず」 would make this sound more formal
      and less like a casual complaint.
  - english: He contributes to research, and he trains young researchers as well.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は 研究 に 貢献 する {は もとより}、若手 研究 者 の 育成 に も 力 を 入れ て いる。
      - 彼 は 研究 に 貢献 する {のみ なら ず}、若手 研究 者 の 育成 に も 力 を 入れ て いる。
    english_literally: As for him, research contributes, naturally, young researchers' development also
      effort is putting in.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 研究 に 貢献 する。{それ に} 若手 研究 者 の 育成 に も 力 を 入れ て いる。
        english: He contributes to research. In addition, he is putting effort into training young researchers.
        hint: While this example works, a simple 'in addition' doesn't convey the full sense of 'not only
          X, but also Y' where the second point is an important extension of the first. 「はもとより」 or 「のみならず」
          emphasize his comprehensive dedication.
    scene: A university dean is describing a professor's contributions.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「のみならず」 is highly appropriate here due to its formality and the emphasis it places on the
      professor's broad contributions, extending beyond research to nurturing new talent. 「はもとより」 is also
      suitable, indicating research contribution is a given, and fostering young talent is an additional,
      important aspect.
  - english: The company values not only profit but also social responsibility.
    japanese:
      - その 企業 は 利益 {は もとより}、社会 的 責任 も 重視 し て いる。
      - その 企業 は 利益 {のみ なら ず}、社会 的 責任 も 重視 し て いる。
    english_literally: That company, profit, naturally, social responsibility also emphasizes.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 企業 は 利益 を {もちろん} 重視 し て いる が、社会 的 責任 も 重視 し て いる。
        english: That company, of course, values profit, but also values social responsibility.
        hint: 「もちろん」 focuses on the obviousness of valuing profit. 「のみならず」 (and はもとより) more directly states
          that responsibility is considered *in addition to* profit, showing a broader scope of values.
          We need an expression that states 'not only X but also Y'.
    scene: A company representative is presenting their corporate philosophy.
    register: formal
    setting: persuasive
    nuance: Using 「のみならず」 highlights the company's commitment beyond mere profit, extending to social
      responsibility, which is often seen as a higher ethical consideration. This creates a positive and
      comprehensive image. 「はもとより」 serves a similar purpose.
  - english: This city attracts tourists, and it is also a great place to live.
    japanese:
      - この 街 は 観光 客 に 人気 が ある {は もとより}、住み やすい 場所 で も ある。
      - この 街 は 観光 客 に 人気 が ある {のみ なら ず}、住み やすい 場所 で も ある。
    english_literally: This city, tourists popularity has, naturally, easy to live place also is.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 街 は 観光 客 に 人気 が ある。{その 上} 住み やすい 場所 で も ある。
        english: This city is popular with tourists. On top of that, it's also an easy place to live.
        hint: 「その上」 is a simple additive phrase. 「はもとより」 or 「のみならず」 suggest that its tourist appeal is
          a given, and its livability is another key, perhaps more important, attribute, showing a more
          integrated expansion of its characteristics.
    scene: A city official is promoting the city.
    register: formal
    setting: optimistic
    nuance: 「はもとより」 is effective here as it acknowledges the city's obvious tourist appeal while emphasizing
      its additional, crucial quality as a good place to live. 「のみならず」 would convey a similar idea with
      added formality, suitable for an official statement.
  - english: The research requires a lot of time, and also a lot of money.
    japanese:
      - その 研究 は 時間 {は もとより}、多額 の 費用 も 要する。
      - その 研究 は 時間 {のみ なら ず}、多額 の 費用 も 要する。
    english_literally: That research, time, naturally, large amount of cost also requires.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 研究 は 時間 も かかる。{そして} 多額 の 費用 も 要する。
        english: That research takes time. And it also requires a large amount of money.
        hint: 「そして」 is a simple conjunction. We need a phrase that combines the two requirements, indicating
          that time is a basic need, but large funds are also necessary for the research to proceed.
    scene: A scientist is explaining the demands of a complex research project.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「のみならず」 is well-suited here to convey that the research demands not only time (which is often
      a given for research) but also substantial financial resources, highlighting the comprehensive nature
      of the requirements. 「はもとより」 could also be used with a slightly less formal but still appropriate
      tone.
