jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: adjective
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to express proficiency, skill, or a personal strong point. Can also convey a sense
    of pride or triumph in one's ability. Often implies a natural aptitude rather than just learned skill.
  function: Expresses ability, specialty, or confidence.
  nuance: Implies a natural talent or something one feels confident and perhaps a bit proud about. Differs
    from 上手 (jouzu), which is more about objective skill, and 好き (suki), which is about preference.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a な-adjective (adjectival noun).
etymology: The kanji 得 (toku) means 'gain, obtain, acquire' and 意 (i) means 'idea, thought, mind.' Together,
  得意 literally suggests 'gaining favor/advantage in one's mind' or 'what one's mind has acquired well.'
  This historical context underpins its modern meaning of being proficient at something and feeling confident
  or proud about it.
writeup: '得意 (tokui) is a versatile Japanese word that functions as a な-adjective (adjectival noun), primarily
  conveying the meaning of being good at something, one''s strong point, or specialty. It can also carry
  an emotional nuance of pride or triumph regarding one''s ability.Key Usage Patterns: * [Noun] が 得意だ:
  Used to express being good at a specific subject, sport, or activity. For example, 「数学が{得意だ}」 (I am
  good at math). * [Verb dictionary form] の が 得意だ: Used when the strong point is an action. The verb needs
  to be nominalized with の. For example, 「料理をするのが{得意だ}」 (I am good at cooking). * 得意な [Noun]: Used to
  describe a noun as one''s strong point or specialty. For example, 「{得意な}科目」 (my strong subject).The
  nuance of "pride" or "triumph" emerges when 得意 is used in contexts where one has achieved something
  well or proven their capability. For instance, after winning a game, someone might say 「{得意な}顔をする」 (to
  make a triumphant face).'
false_friends:
  - term: 好き (suki)
    meaning: to like; to be fond of
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 得意 means 'good at' or 'one's strong point', 好き expresses a personal preference or enjoyment,
      not necessarily skill. One might like something without being good at it, or be good at something
      without liking it.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Nounが好みだ (to like)
  - term: 上手 (jouzu)
    meaning: skillful; good at
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 上手 (jouzu) is a more objective assessment of skill, indicating that someone performs a task
      well. 得意, on the other hand, implies a personal strong point often suggesting a natural talent or
      confidence, and it's generally not used to praise someone else directly. When praising others, 上手は
      (jouzu wa) is more common. For example, one would say 「日本語が{お上手}ですね」 (Your Japanese is good, isn't
      it?), not 「日本語が{お得意}ですね」.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:上手 (skillful)
  - term: 苦手 (nigatena)
    meaning: not good at; weak point
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 苦手 is the direct opposite of 得意. It describes something one is not good at, struggles with,
      or dislikes. While 得意 implies confidence and aptitude, 苦手 implies a lack of confidence or difficulty.
    grammar_point: 苦手 (not good at)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the subtle differences between 得意, 好き, and 上手 is key to using
  them correctly. While all three can relate to abilities or preferences, their focus differs. 得意 emphasizes
  a personal strong point often implying a natural talent or confidence. 上手 is a more objective assessment
  of skill, indicating that someone performs a task well. 好き expresses a personal preference or enjoyment.
  Furthermore, 苦手 serves as the direct antonym to 得意, expressing one's weakness or dislike for something.

      specialty in English, rather than just objective skill.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 得意 can be used to describe skills, subjects, or activities
  where one has a natural aptitude or feels a high degree of confidence. It's often paired with the particle
  が for the object of skill or のが for actions. The nuance of 'pride' can be seen in expressions like 「得意な顔」.
  Remember to choose the appropriate copula (だ, です, でございます) and tense (だった) based on the context and desired
  level of formality.
