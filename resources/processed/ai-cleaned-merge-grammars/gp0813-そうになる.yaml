    "writeup": "The grammar point 「そうになる」 expresses that something almost happened. It's used to convey a sense of near occurrence or being on the verge of something. The structure is typically: Verb (ます stem) + 「そうになる」. This grammar point is commonly used in spoken Japanese to describe situations where an action or event nearly occurred but was ultimately avoided. For example, 「泣きそうになった」 (nakisou ni natta) means \"I almost cried.\"",
