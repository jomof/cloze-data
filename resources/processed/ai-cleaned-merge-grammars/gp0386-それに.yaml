        "part-of-speech": "conjunction",

        "nuance": "The information introduced by それに must maintain the same positive or negative tone as the preceding statement. It cannot connect a positive statement to a negative one, or vice versa."
    },
    "etymology": "それに is formed by combining the pronoun それ (that) and the case-marking particle に (to/in). It literally means \"to that\" or \"in addition to that,\" with それ referring to the entire preceding clause or sentence.",
    "writeup": "The conjunction **それに** serves to add information to a previously stated clause or sentence. Conceptually, it translates to \"and to that\" or \"in addition to that,\" where \"that\" encompasses the preceding context. This makes it similar in meaning to English expressions like \"moreover,\" \"furthermore,\" or simply \"and.\"\n\nA critical characteristic of **それに** is the **tone consistency** it demands. The information introduced by **それに** (the B part) must logically follow and share the same positive or negative emotional or factual valence as the preceding information (the A part). For instance, if the first statement describes positive attributes, the additional information must also be positive. Conversely, if the first statement presents negative circumstances, the following statement introduced by **それに** must continue that negative tone.\n\nThis principle stems from its etymological roots: the particle に highlights that the additional information is being *added* to the existing context, implying a coherent, cumulative effect rather than a contrasting or unrelated one. Therefore, **それに** is unsuitable for connecting statements of opposing tones, as this would violate the sense of logical addition.",
