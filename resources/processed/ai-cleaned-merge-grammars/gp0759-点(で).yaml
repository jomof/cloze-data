    "etymology": "The word 「点 (ten)」 literally means \"point\" or \"spot.\" When combined with the particle 「で (de),\" which indicates location or means, it forms a phrase that signifies \"at a point\" or \"in terms of a point.\" This linguistic evolution allows 「点(で)」 to express a specific aspect, regard, or criterion, as if one is looking at something from a particular 'point' of view.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「点(で) (ten de)」 is used to specify a particular aspect or point of view when making a statement or comparison. It is akin to saying \"in terms of,\" \"from the point of view of,\" or \"in that\" in English. This expression is frequently encountered in analytical or comparative discussions, enabling the speaker to focus on a precise criterion or characteristic.\n\nIt can be used in four primary formations:\n\n*   **[Demonstrative/Quantifier] + 点(で)**: This highlights a specific instance or quantity. For example, 「この点で (kono ten de)」 means \"in this regard.\"\n*   **[Noun/Adjective(い/な)stem/さ] + 点(で)**: This specifies a particular category or quality. For instance, 「値段の点で (nedan no ten de)」 translates to \"in terms of price,\" while 「静かさの点で (shizukasa no ten de)」 means \"in terms of quietness.\"\n*   **[Noun] + [Adjective(い/な)stem]さ + という + 点(で)**: This structure is used to emphasize a particular quality related to a noun. For example, 「頭のよさという点で (atama no yosa to iu ten de)」 means \"in terms of intelligence.\"\n*   **[Sentence in Informal Form] + という + 点(で)**: This formation is employed to explain the basis of a statement by highlighting a particular aspect or reason. For example, 「性能がいいという点で (seinō ga ii to iu ten de)」 means \"in that the performance is good.\"\n\n「点(で)」 allows for precise expression, directing the listener's attention to the exact aspect being discussed or evaluated. Its analytical nature makes it suitable for formal discussions and comparative analyses.",

While it can often be used interchangeably with 「点(で)」 in certain contexts (e.g., 「安全性 の 面 で」 vs. 「安全性 の 点 で」), 「面」 can also refer to a physical surface, which 「点(で)」 cannot. 「点(で)」 typically implies a more specific point of view or criterion."

While the 「～という点(で)」 formation can express a reason, it does so by framing the reason as a specific *aspect* or *point* of consideration. For instance, 「忙しい という 理由 で」 (for the reason that I'm busy) directly gives 'being busy' as the cause, whereas 「忙しい という 点 で」 (in that I'm busy) uses 'being busy' as a particular aspect or consideration."

Use 「点(で)」 when you want to highlight a specific criterion, characteristic, or facet within a broader context. If you're discussing a general aspect, 「面」 might be suitable. If you're talking about a specific scenario or condition, use 「場合」.
