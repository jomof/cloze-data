    "etymology": "The word 「点 (ten)」 literally means \"point\" or \"spot.\" When combined with the particle 「で (de),\" which indicates location or means, it forms a phrase that signifies \"at a point\" or \"in terms of a point.\" This linguistic evolution allows 「点(で)」 to express a specific aspect, regard, or criterion, as if one is looking at something from a particular 'point' of view.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「点(で) (ten de)」 is used to specify a particular aspect or point of view when making a statement or comparison. It is akin to saying \"in terms of,\" \"from the point of view of,\" or \"in that\" in English. This expression is frequently encountered in analytical or comparative discussions, enabling the speaker to focus on a precise criterion or characteristic.\n\nIt can be used in four primary formations:\n\n*   **[Demonstrative/Quantifier] + 点(で)**: This highlights a specific instance or quantity. For example, 「この 点 で (kono ten de)」 means \"in this regard.\"\n*   **[Noun/Adjective(い/な)stem/さ] + 点(で)**: This specifies a particular category or quality. For instance, 「値段 の 点 で (nedan no ten de)」 translates to \"in terms of price,\" while 「静かさ の 点 で (shizukasa no ten de)」 means \"in terms of quietness.\"\n*   **[Noun] + [Adjective(い/な)stem]さ + と いう + 点(で)**: This structure is used to emphasize a particular quality related to a noun. For example, 「頭 の よさ と いう 点 で (atama no yosa to iu ten de)」 means \"in terms of intelligence.\"\n*   **[Sentence in Informal Form] + と いう + 点(で)**: This formation is employed to explain the basis of a statement by highlighting a particular aspect or reason. For example, 「性能 が いい と いう 点 で (seinō ga ii to iu ten de)」 means \"in that the performance is good.\"\n\n「点(で)」 allows for precise expression, directing the listener's attention to the exact aspect being discussed or evaluated. Its analytical nature makes it suitable for formal discussions and comparative analyses.",
