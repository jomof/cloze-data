    "etymology": "「機 (ki)」 in this context literally means 'machine' or 'mechanism,' but colloquially it has evolved to signify an 'opportunity,' 'chance,' or 'occasion.' The particle 「を」 functions as an object marker, here highlighting the preceding noun as the specific opportunity being acted upon. The particle 「に」 denotes the point in time or occasion at which an action occurs. Thus, 「を機に」 combines these elements to express the deliberate action of leveraging a particular event or situation as a turning point for something new or significant.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「を機に」 is used to express that a certain event or situation is actively seized as an opportunity or turning point to initiate a new action or change. It implies a conscious decision by the speaker or subject to utilize the given circumstance for a specific purpose. It is more deliberate than simply stating a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nThis expression is typically applied to significant life events, major decisions, or important turning points. It can often be translated as 'taking advantage of the opportunity of (A), (B)' or 'on the occasion of (A), (B)', where (A) is the event and (B) is the action taken.\n\n「を機に」 strongly emphasizes the intentionality of the action that follows. The event or situation (A) is not merely a trigger, but rather a carefully considered impetus for the subsequent action (B). This makes it suitable for formal contexts, discussions of important life changes, or reflective statements about personal development.",
