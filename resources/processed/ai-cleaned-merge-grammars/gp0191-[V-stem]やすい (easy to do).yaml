pronunciation:

  romaji: yasui
formation:
  Verb (ます-stem) + やすい: Indicates that an action is easy to perform, often due to the inherent nature
    or design of the subject or object.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  function: Indicates the inherent ease with which an action can be performed or experienced.
  nuance: Focuses on the inherent characteristic of an object or situation that makes an action effortless
    or straightforward. It describes something designed to facilitate the action, rather than a person's
    skill.
  counterpoint: にくい (difficult to do)
  colocation: Often used with transitive verbs, describing the ease of manipulating or interacting with
    an object. It can also be used with intransitive verbs, describing the ease of a state or process.
  grammatical-role: Functions as an い-adjective, meaning it can modify nouns or act as a predicate at
    the end of a sentence.
etymology: The suffix 「やすい」 originates from the い-adjective 「易い」 (やす・い), meaning "easy," "simple," or
  "uncomplicated." When attached to the ます-stem of a verb, it directly imparts this sense of ease to the
  action described by the verb. This linguistic evolution highlights how a general concept of "easiness"
  was grammaticalized to describe the facility of performing an action.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「V-stem やすい」 attaches to the ます-stem of verbs to express that an action is easy to perform. It often describes an inherent quality of an object or situation that makes the action straightforward or effortless. For example, a book that is 「読みやすい」 (easy to read) might have large print, clear explanations, or an engaging plot. This grammar point differs from simply stating that something is easy to do by emphasizing the innate characteristic that contributes to that ease.

  This form acts as an い-adjective, meaning it conjugates like any other い-adjective (e.g., 「やすくない」, 「やすかった」). It can modify nouns directly (e.g., 「使いやすい道具」 - easy-to-use tool) or appear at the end of a sentence (e.g., 「このペンはとても書きやすい。」 - This pen is very easy to write with).

  It is crucial to distinguish this usage of 「やすい」 from its homophone 「[V-stem]やすい (prone to・likely to)」, which expresses a tendency or susceptibility, often to negative outcomes. The context usually makes the intended meaning clear. When 「V-stem やすい」 describes inherent ease, it often refers to the design, quality, or condition of something.
false_friends:
  - term: '[V-stem]やすい (prone to・likely to)'
    meaning: prone to; likely to; apt to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This other usage of 「やすい」 indicates a **tendency** or **susceptibility** to an action or state,
      often implying something undesirable or an inherent weakness (e.g., 「壊れやすい」 - prone to breaking).
      Unlike the 'easy to do' meaning, it does not describe inherent ease of action.
    grammar_point: '[V-stem]やすい (prone to・likely to)'
  - term: 簡単だ
    meaning: simple; easy (in general)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「簡単だ」 describes something as **simple** or **uncomplicated** in its nature or structure, often
      referring to a task or problem. While a simple task might also be easy to do, 「V-stem やすい」 specifically
      describes the **ease of performing an action** related to it, often highlighting a user-friendly
      aspect or design.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:簡単だ (simple)
  - term: Vことができる
    meaning: can do; be able to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「Vことができる」 expresses **ability** or **possibility** (i.e., one is capable of doing something,
      or it is possible to do it). In contrast, 「V-stem やすい」 emphasizes the **effortlessness** or low
      difficulty involved in performing the action, assuming the ability is already present.
    grammar_point: することができる (can・be able to)
  - term: 得意だ
    meaning: to be good at; to be skillful
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「得意だ」 describes **one's own skill** or proficiency in performing an action, making it easy
      for *that particular person*. 「V-stem やすい」 describes the **inherent ease of the action or object
      itself**, irrespective of the performer's individual skill level.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:得意だ (to be good at)
  - term: 楽だ
    meaning: easy; comfortable; relaxed
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「楽だ」 means something is **easy** in the sense of being **comfortable, not burdensome, or requiring
      little effort**, often implying a pleasant experience or relief from hardship. While overlapping,
      「V-stem やすい」 more directly focuses on the ease of *doing* an action, particularly regarding design
      or usability.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:楽だ (easy・comfortable)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing 「V-stem やすい」 (easy to do) from other similar expressions,
  consider whether the focus is on the inherent quality of the item or action (「やすい」), the simplicity
  of the task itself (「簡単だ」), the capability to perform the action (「Vことができる」), or a person's skill level
  (「得意だ」). The key is that 「やすい」 points to what makes the action easy, often an aspect of its design or
  nature.

        english: This type of clothing is easy to wash and dries quickly, so it's convenient for travel.
        hint: 「洗いやすい」 and 「乾きやすい」 specifically refer to the inherent properties of the fabric that make
          washing and drying effortless. 「洗濯 が 簡単」 is more general for easy washing, and 「すぐ 乾く」 means
          dries quickly, not necessarily easily due to material.
    scene: A person shares packing tips with a friend before a trip.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The use of 「洗いやすい」 and 「乾きやすい」 highlights the practical benefits of the clothing for travel
      due to its material properties. The conjunction 「し」 lists multiple reasons for its convenience.
      The casual tone is suitable for advice between friends, while the second variation uses more formal
      phrasing for a general recommendation.
post_example_writeup: Understanding 「V-stem やすい」 helps to appreciate how Japanese describes inherent qualities
  that facilitate actions, a nuance often conveyed through design or natural properties. Paying attention
  to context is key to differentiating this from the 'prone to' usage of the same ending. When choosing
  between 「やすい」 and words like 「簡単」 or 「楽」, consider if you are describing the inherent quality that *makes*
  an action easy, or simply that something is easy or comfortable in a more general sense.
