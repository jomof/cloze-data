meaning: To come (after action); to continue (doing); to become (gradually)
meaning_warning: While てくる can indicate 'to come,' its primary function as a grammatical auxiliary goes
  beyond simple physical movement to include temporal progression, gradual change, or the completion of
  an action with implied return. Do not confuse it with the standalone verb くる (to come).

pronunciation:
  katakana: テクル
  romaji: tekuru
formation:
  '[Verb te-form] + くる': Indicates an action that happens and then moves towards the speaker, or a change
    that has occurred or is occurring from the past until the present.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: General
  function: Indicates movement towards the speaker, continuation of an action/state from the past to the
    present, or a gradual change.
  nuance: The meaning of てくる often depends on the type of verb it attaches to. For verbs of movement,
    it implies coming. For verbs of change, it implies a process unfolding over time up to the present.
    For actions, it can imply continuation or return.
etymology: The grammar point 「てくる」 is a compound form, combining the te-form of a verb with the verb 来る
  (くる), meaning "to come." The te-form serves to connect verbs, indicating a sequence of actions or a
  preceding state. In this construction, 来る adds a directional or temporal nuance. Historically, this
  combination evolved to describe an action that moves towards the speaker or a state that develops and
  approaches the present moment. It implies a trajectory from a point in the past or a distant location
  to the present moment or the speaker's location.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point **てくる** functions as an auxiliary verb, attaching to the te-form of another verb. It primarily conveys three core meanings:

  1.  **Movement towards the speaker**: When combined with verbs of movement, **てくる** indicates that an action is performed, and then the subject moves towards the speaker or a reference point. For example, 「持って来る (motte kuru)」 means "to bring (something)" (literally, "to hold and come"), implying movement towards the speaker.

  2.  **Gradual change or process from past to present**: This is a very common usage where **てくる** signifies that a state or action has been developing or progressing over time, leading up to the present moment. It implies a continuous or gradual change. For instance, 「暖かくなって来た (atatakaku natte kita)」 means "it has become warm (gradually, over time)."

  3.  **Completion of an action with implied return**: In specific contexts, particularly with verbs like 行く (iku, to go), **てくる** forms expressions like 「行って来る (itte kuru)」, which means "to go and come back." This implies that the action (going) is performed, and a return to the original location or speaker is expected.

  It is important to differentiate **てくる** from its counterpart **ていく**. While **てくる** describes movement or change towards the speaker or the present, **ていく** generally describes movement or change away from the speaker or progressing into the future. The specific nuance of **てくる** is determined by the main verb it attaches to and the context of the sentence. While the kanji 来る is often used for the literal "come" meaning, the hiragana くる is frequently seen in the grammatical auxiliary sense, especially for changes over time.
false_friends:
  - term: くる
    meaning: To come
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「くる」 simply means "to come" as a verb of motion and does not inherently express a continuous
      action or a gradual change over time like 「てくる」.
    grammar_point: くる (come)
  - term: になる・くなる (to become)
    meaning: To become (Adjective)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「〜になる」 and 「〜くなる」 describe a direct change into a specific state. While 「てくる」 can also
      indicate 'to become,' it specifically implies a *gradual* process or change that has unfolded over
      time leading up to the present moment.
    grammar_point: になる・くなる (to become)
  - term: つづける (to continue)
    meaning: To continue (doing)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「つづける」 means "to continue" an action or state. While 「てくる」 can also imply continuation, 「つづける」
      specifically emphasizes the uninterrupted nature of the action, whereas 「てくる」 emphasizes the *result*
      or *current state* of a process that has been ongoing.
    grammar_point: つづける (to continue)
  - term: ばかりだ (only continues to)
    meaning: (Only) continue to, Keep on -ing, More and more
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ばかりだ」 emphasizes that a situation is exclusively moving in one direction, often negatively,
      or that something is *only* continuing. 「てくる」, conversely, focuses on an emergence or a process
      of change that has developed up to the present, not necessarily an exclusively unidirectional trend.
    grammar_point: ばかりだ (only continues to)
  - term: ていく (to continue or move away)
    meaning: To ~ and go, To start
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ていく」 indicates movement away from the speaker, or a change that will progress from the present
      into the future. This is in direct contrast to 「てくる」, which implies movement or change towards the
      speaker or leading up to the present moment.
    grammar_point: ていく (to continue or move away)
post_false_friends_writeup: The key distinction between **てくる** and these similar expressions lies in
  the implied direction and temporal focus. **てくる** consistently brings the action or change *towards*
  the speaker or the present moment, whether literally or figuratively. Other expressions may denote simple
  continuation, a change to a fixed state, or movement away, but they lack this inherent 'coming towards'
  aspect.
examples:
  - english: I'm about to go out and come back.
    japanese:
      - そろそろ 外 に 出かけ て {くる} よ。
      - そろそろ 外 に 出かけ て {き ます} よ。
      - そろそろ 外 へ 出かけ て {くる} よ。
    english_literally: Soon outside go and come.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - そろそろ 外 に {出かける} よ。
        english: I'm about to go out.
        hint: Using just 出かける (to go out) doesn't convey the implied return. We're looking for an expression
          that suggests leaving and coming back.
    scene: A man is leaving his apartment to run a quick errand and informs his roommate.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「出かけてくる」 combines the action of going out with the expectation of returning, implying a round
      trip. This is common in casual Japanese to inform someone you will be back shortly after leaving.
    etymology: The combination of the te-form of 「出かける」 (to go out) and 「くる」 (to come) literally means
      "go out and come." This structure specifically implies an action undertaken away from the speaker's
      current location, followed by a return to that location. It reflects a common pattern of expressing
      temporary excursions in Japanese.
  - english: I'm just going to the convenience store.
    japanese:
      - ちょっと コンビニ に 行っ て {き ます}。
      - ちょっと コンビニ に 行っ て {くる}。
    english_literally: Just convenience store to go and come.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ちょっと コンビニ に {行き ます}。
        english: I'm just going to the convenience store.
        hint: 「行きます」 simply states you are going. 「行ってきます」 implies that you will go and then return. We're
          looking for a phrase that conveys a brief departure with the intention of coming back.
    scene: A person tells their housemate they are stepping out briefly.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: 「行ってきます」 is a very common phrase used when leaving a place with the intention of returning.
      It literally means "I'll go and come back," highlighting the expected return. This is typically
      used in casual settings among family or housemates. The phrase is gender-neutral, making it suitable
      for a female speaker addressing another female housemate.
    etymology: This is a fixed expression combining the te-form of 「行く」 (to go) and 「くる」 (to come). Historically,
      it encapsulates the idea of performing an action (going) and then returning to the point of origin,
      making it a concise way to announce a temporary departure.
  - english: Please buy a cake and bring it for Mom's birthday.
    japanese:
      - お 母 さん の 誕生 日 に ケーキ を 買っ て {き て} ください。
      - お 母 さん の 誕生 日 に ケーキ を 買っ て {き なさい}。
    english_literally: Mother's birthday for cake buy and come ください.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - お 母 さん の 誕生 日 に ケーキ を {買っ て} ください。
        english: Please buy a cake for Mom's birthday.
        hint: Simply using 買って (buy) does not convey the expectation of bringing the item back. We're
          looking for an instruction that includes both the act of buying and returning with the item.
    scene: A father asks his child to help prepare for their mother's birthday celebration.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: '「買ってきてください」 uses the te-form of 「てくる」 in a command form to imply two actions: buying the
      cake at a different location and then bringing it back to the speaker''s location. This nuance of
      ''perform an action elsewhere and return with the result'' is a key function of 「てくる」.'
    etymology: 'The te-form of 「買う」 (to buy), which is 「買って」, combined with the te-form of 「くる」 (to come),
      「きて」, forms 「買ってきて」. This construction effectively bundles two sequential actions into a single
      instruction: first, the action of buying, and second, the action of bringing the purchased item
      back. The structure mirrors the physical movement implied by 「くる」.'
  - english: The package I was waiting for has finally arrived.
    japanese:
      - 待っ て い た 荷物 が やっと 届い て {き た}。
      - 待っ て い た 荷物 が やっと 届い て {き まし た}。
    english_literally: Waited package finally arrived and came.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 待っ て い た 荷物 が やっと {届い た}。
        english: The package I was waiting for finally arrived.
        hint: 「届いた」 simply states that the package arrived. 「届いてきた」 emphasizes the movement of the package
          to the speaker's location, highlighting its arrival from elsewhere. We're looking for an expression
          that conveys the sense of something coming to you.
    scene: Someone has been eagerly waiting for an online order to arrive.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: 「届いてきた」 emphasizes the physical movement of the package towards the speaker's location, implying
      it has come from somewhere else. It adds a sense of expectation being met as the item 'came to'
      them. This sentence is a self-reflection, often said aloud to oneself upon receiving the item.
    etymology: 「届く」 (to arrive, to reach) in its te-form 「届いて」 combined with 「くる」 (to come) means that
      something has arrived or reached the speaker's location, carrying the directional nuance of 「くる」
      towards the speaker.
  - english: It has suddenly gotten cold, hasn't it?
    japanese:
      - 急 に 寒く なっ て {き まし た} ね。
      - 急 に 寒く なっ て {き た} ね。
    english_literally: Suddenly cold become and came, right?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 急 に 寒く {なり まし た} ね。
        english: It suddenly became cold, didn't it?
        hint: While なりました simply states a change, it doesn't emphasize the gradual process from the past
          up to the present. We're looking for an expression that conveys a change that has developed
          over time.
    scene: Two colleagues exchange pleasantries as they meet in the office hallway on a chilly morning.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「寒くなってきました」 uses the auxiliary verb 「てくる」 to express a gradual change that has
      occurred over time and continued up to the present moment. It emphasizes the process of becoming
      cold, rather than a sudden, instantaneous shift. This usage is common for describing environmental
      changes in a polite, general way, suitable for both male and female speakers.
    etymology: The use of 「なる」 (to become) in its te-form 「なって」 combined with 「くる」 (to come) highlights
      a process of change that has developed over time and reached the present state. This structure effectively
      conveys the 'coming into being' or 'gradual emergence' of a new condition, drawing on 「くる」's core
      meaning of movement towards the present.
  - english: His Japanese has been getting better and better lately.
    japanese:
      - この 頃、彼 の 日本 語 は どんどん 上手 に なっ て {き まし た}。
      - この 頃、彼 の 日本 語 は どんどん 上手 に なっ て {き た}。

      - competing_japanese:
          - この 頃、彼 の 日本 語 は どんどん 上手 に {なり まし た}。
        english: Recently, his Japanese got better and better.
        hint: While 上手になりました indicates a change, it lacks the nuance of a gradual, continuous process
          leading up to the present. We're looking for an expression that highlights ongoing improvement.
    scene: Two friends are discussing a mutual acquaintance's progress in learning Japanese.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「なってきました」 indicates a gradual process of improvement that has continued from the past until
      the present, emphasizing the progress made over time. This usage is common in casual conversation
      to describe ongoing development.
    etymology: The phrase 「上手になってきました」, combining 「なる」 (to become) in its te-form with 「くる」, describes
      a gradual change that has unfolded over a period and reached the current state. The meaning is rooted
      in 「くる」's sense of movement towards the present, implying that the 'becoming good' has progressed
      progressively from a past point until now.
  - english: This new project has gradually taken shape.
    japanese:
      - この 新しい プロジェクト は、徐々 に 形 に なっ て {き た}。
      - この 新しい プロジェクト は、徐々 に 形 に なっ て {き まし た}。
    english_literally: This new project gradually form into became and came.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 新しい プロジェクト は、徐々 に 形 に {なっ た}。
        english: This new project gradually took shape.
        hint: Using just なった (became) describes a completed change but doesn't convey the sense of a gradual
          process or development up to the present. We're looking for an expression that highlights the
          progression of the project's formation over time.
    scene: A project manager is updating their team on the progress of a complex project.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The phrase 「形になってきた」 uses 「てくる」 to emphasize that the project's development into a tangible
      form has been a gradual process over time, leading up to its current state. It highlights the progression
      of the project. This is a common way to describe developments in a professional or academic setting,
      suitable for any gender when addressing a group.
    etymology: 「形になる」 means "to take shape" or "to materialize." When combined with 「てくる」 as 「形になってきた」,
      it signifies that this process of materialization has been ongoing and has progressed to the present.
      The historical nuance of 「くる」 as movement towards the speaker or present reinforces the idea of
      the project's form gradually emerging into existence.
  - english: When I'm with her, I somehow start to feel uneasy.
    japanese:
      - 僕 は 彼女 と いる と、なぜ か 落ち着か なく なっ て {くる}。
      - 僕 は 彼女 と いる と、なぜ か 落ち着か なく なっ て {き ます}。
    english_literally: I with her am when, somehow uneasy become and come.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 僕 は 彼女 と いる と、なぜ か 落ち着か なく {なる}。
        english: When I'm with her, I somehow become uneasy.
        hint: While 落ち着かなくなる (become uneasy) describes the change of state, it doesn't express the nuance
          of a gradual, emerging feeling. We're looking for a phrase that conveys the subtle onset and
          development of an emotion.
    scene: A young man confides in a friend about his feelings when he's around a particular girl.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The phrase 「落ち着かなく なって くる」 conveys a process where the feeling of uneasiness gradually arises
      and continues when the speaker is with the girl. This is a common way for male speakers to express
      emergent or developing emotions in a casual context, highlighting the subtle, progressive nature
      of the feeling. The male speech particle 「僕」 is used here.
    etymology: The auxiliary verb 「てくる」 attached to 「なる」 (to become) as 「なってくる」 expresses a change or
      state that begins to emerge and gradually develops or continues into the present. This reflects
      「くる」's inherent meaning of 'coming' or 'approaching', applied to an internal state or emotion.
  - english: Lately, I've started to understand Japanese better.
    japanese:
      - 最近、日本 語 が 分かる よう に なっ て {き た}。
      - 最近、日本 語 が 分かる よう に なっ て {き まし た}。
    english_literally: Lately, Japanese understandable become and came.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 最近、日本 語 が 分かる よう に {なっ た}。
        english: Lately, I came to understand Japanese.
        hint: While 「なった」 indicates a change, 「なってきた」 implies a gradual process of becoming understood
          over time. We're looking for an expression that conveys this progressive development of understanding.
    scene: A student proudly shares their progress with a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: optimistic
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: 「分かるように なって きた」 indicates a gradual improvement in understanding Japanese over a period of
      time, leading up to the present moment. This usage of 「てくる」 is perfect for describing a skill that
      has progressively developed, and can be used by speakers of any gender.
    etymology: The phrase 「分かるようになる」 means "to come to understand." Adding 「てくる」 to it, forming 「分かるように
      なって くる」, emphasizes the gradual and continuous process of acquiring that understanding, with the
      knowledge 'coming towards' the learner over time.
  - english: Since coming to Japan, I have continuously studied Japanese.
    japanese:
      - 日本 に 来 て から、ずっと 日本 語 を 勉強 し て {き まし た}。
      - 日本 に 来 て から、ずっと 日本 語 を 勉強 し て {き た}。
    english_literally: Japan to came since, continuously Japanese studied and came.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 日本 に 来 て から、ずっと 日本 語 を {勉強 し まし た}。
        english: Since coming to Japan, I continuously studied Japanese.
        hint: Using just 勉強しました (studied) is a simple past tense and doesn't emphasize the ongoing or
          continuous nature of the action from a past point up to the present. We're looking for a nuance
          of sustained effort over time.
    scene: A student reflecting on their long-term efforts in learning Japanese since arriving in the
      country.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「勉強してきました」 emphasizes the ongoing nature of the Japanese study from a point in
      the past (coming to Japan) up until the present moment. It signifies a continuous process or accumulation
      of effort. This conveys dedication and sustained effort, and is appropriate for a female speaker
      reflecting on her accomplishments to an older male mentor.
    etymology: The auxiliary verb 「てくる」, when attached to 「勉強する」 (to study) as 「勉強してくる」, expresses an
      action that has been performed continuously or repeatedly from a past point up to the present. It
      conveys a sense of accumulated experience or sustained effort, mirroring the concept of 'coming'
      from the past to the present with the action.
  - english: Even after a long time, the pain hasn't gone away.
    japanese:
      - 長い 間 経っ て も、痛み が 引い て {こ ない}。
      - 長い 間 経っ て も、痛み が 引い て {き ませ ん}。
    english_literally: Long time passed even if, pain draw and not come.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 長い 間 経っ て も、痛み が {引か ない}。
        english: Even after a long time, the pain doesn't subside.
        hint: While 「引かない」 means the pain doesn't subside, 「引いてこない」 suggests that the pain hasn't decreased
          or receded over time, implying a lack of progressive improvement. We're looking for a phrase
          that expresses a persistent condition that hasn't changed or improved.
    scene: Someone discusses a persistent physical ailment with a doctor or friend, expressing frustration.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「引いてこない」 uses the negative form of 「てくる」 to express that the pain has not gradually subsided
      or receded over time, implying a persistent condition. This usage emphasizes the lack of a desired
      progressive change towards the speaker (or current state). The sentence is gender-neutral but can
      be used by a male speaker to express frustration about a health issue.
    etymology: 「引く」 (hiku) can mean to recede or withdraw. When combined with the negative form of 「てくる」
      (te konai), it implies that something (like pain) has not moved towards a state of receding or disappearing
      over time. It signifies a lack of expected gradual change.
post_example_writeup: As illustrated in the examples, **てくる** allows for expressing movement towards the
  speaker, a continuous action from the past to the present, or a gradual change. Paying close attention
  to the context and the preceding verb is essential for understanding the specific nuance being conveyed.
