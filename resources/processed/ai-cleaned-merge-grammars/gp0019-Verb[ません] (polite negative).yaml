formation:
  Verb[ます-stem] + ません: Used to create the polite negative form of a verb.
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  function: Negates a verb in a polite context.
  nuance: Indicates non-occurrence or denial in a polite, respectful manner. It is a direct polite negative.
  grammatical-role: Polite negation of actions, states, or existence.
etymology: The auxiliary verb 「ます」 originates from the classical auxiliary verb 「まゐらす」, which means 'to
  offer' or 'to serve' in a humble sense, eventually evolving into a general polite marker. Its negative
  form, 「ません」, is a contraction of 「ませぬ」, where 「ませ」 is the irrealis (mizenkei) form of 「ます」 and 「ぬ」 is
  the classical negative auxiliary verb, which later contracted to 「ん」. Thus, 「ません」 literally means something
  like 'does not politely do', establishing its role as a polite negation marker.
writeup: |-
  「ません」 is the standard polite negative form for Japanese verbs. It is directly derived from the polite affirmative 「ます」 form, serving as its negative counterpart. This grammatical construction is fundamental for expressing actions that are not performed, will not be performed, or states that do not exist, all while maintaining a respectful and polite tone suitable for most general conversations, especially when speaking to superiors, strangers, or in formal settings.

  To form the 「ません」 form, you simply take the ます-stem of a verb (which is obtained by dropping 「ます」 from the polite affirmative form) and attach 「ません」. For example, 「食べます」 (to eat) becomes 「食べません」 (will not eat / do not eat), and 「行きます」 (to go) becomes 「行きません」 (will not go / do not go). In the case of 「あります」 (to exist for inanimate objects / to have), its polite negative form is 「ありません」. Similarly, for い-adjectives, the 「ない」 ending becomes 「ありません」 (e.g., 「美味しくありません」 - not delicious) which is a more formal alternative to 「美味しくないです」.

  This form is gender-neutral and can be used by speakers of any age. It is versatile for expressing habitual actions not performed (e.g., 'I don't drink coffee'), future non-actions (e.g., 'I won't go tomorrow'), or general negative statements (e.g., 'That is not correct'). Mastery of 「ません」 is crucial for polite and effective communication in Japanese.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[ない] (plain negative)
    meaning: plain negative form of verbs
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ません」 is the polite form for verb negation, suitable for general respectful interactions.
      In contrast, 「ない」 is the plain or casual form, typically used among close friends and family, or
      when speaking informally. While both express negation, their level of formality is distinct.
    grammar_point: Verb[ない] (plain negative)
  - term: Verb[ませんでした] (polite past negative)
    meaning: polite past negative form of verbs
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ません」 indicates a polite negative in the present or future tense (e.g., 'I don't go,' 'I won't
      go'). 「ませんでした」, however, is the polite past negative form (e.g., 'I didn't go'). The key difference
      lies in the temporal aspect of the negation.
    grammar_point: Verb[ませんでした] (polite past negative)
  - term: ませんか (invitation or suggestion)
    meaning: invitation or suggestion
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ません」 alone is a statement of polite negation, when followed by the question particle
      「か」, as in 「ませんか」, it transforms into an invitation or polite suggestion. For example, 「行きませんか？」
      means 'Won't you go?' or 'Shall we go?', entirely different from the declarative negative 「行きません」
      ('I won't go').
    grammar_point: ませんか (invitation or suggestion)
  - term: い-Adjective[くない] (negative)
    meaning: negative form of い-adjectives
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ません」 is for negating verbs. To negate い-adjectives, you typically use the 「くない」 form (e.g.,
      「高くない」 - not expensive). While you can form a polite negative of い-adjectives by adding 「ありません」
      after the く-form (e.g., 「高 くありません」), the base negation for い-adjectives fundamentally involves 「くない」.
    grammar_point: い-Adjective[くない] (negative)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing 「ません」 from similar expressions, remember that its core
  function is polite verb negation in the non-past tense. Its plain counterpart, 「ない」, fulfills the same
  role but in casual settings. For past negation, 「ませんでした」 is used. The addition of 「か」 to form 「ませんか」
  completely changes the meaning from a negative statement to a polite invitation. Finally, while 「ありません」
  is used for the polite negative of 「ある」 and い-adjectives, the fundamental negative form for い-adjectives
  is 「くない」.

        english: This isn't delicious. (less formal polite)
        hint: While 「美味しくないです」 is commonly used, 「美味しくありません」 is generally considered a more formally correct
          or traditionally polite way to negate an い-adjective in polite speech. We're looking for that
          more formal variant.
    scene: A customer is politely giving feedback on food at a restaurant.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: For い-adjectives, 「ありません」 can be used in place of 「ないです」 after the く-form (e.g., 「美味しくありません」).
      This usage is more formal and slightly older-fashioned than 「美味しくないです」, often lending a more refined
      or even somewhat stiff tone, depending on the context.
post_example_writeup: As demonstrated in the examples, 「ません」 is a versatile polite negative form for verbs
  and the existence verb 「ある」. Its consistent application across various contexts, from expressing personal
  habits to declining invitations, highlights its fundamental role in polite Japanese communication. Pay
  close attention to the tense and the intent of your statement to choose between 「ません」 (non-past negative)
  and 「ませんでした」 (past negative), and to distinguish it from the invitational 「ませんか」. For い-adjectives,
  remember that while 「ありません」 can be used for polite negation, the more common polite form is often 「〜くないです」,
  with 「〜くありません」 conveying a more formal or traditional nuance.
