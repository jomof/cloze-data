        "usage-context": "General use",
        "function": "To indicate the role, capacity, or nature of someone or something.",

        "colocation": "Often used with nouns describing professions, roles, categories, or states."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「として」 is derived from the particle 「と」, which indicates a result or assumption, combined with 「して」, the te-form of the verb 「する」 (to do). This combination creates the nuance of something being regarded or used 'as' something else, establishing a basis or capacity.",
    "writeup": "「として」 expresses the idea of something being considered in a certain role, function, or capacity. It is analogous to \"as\" or \"in the capacity of\" in English. This grammatical structure combines the case marking particle 「と」, used to highlight a result or condition, with 「して」, the te-form of the verb 「する」 (to do).\n\nWhen 「と」 is used to indicate a result, it implies that a preceding element (A) is a plain or unchanging fact, serving as the basis for a subsequent statement (B). By adding 「して」, 「として」 presents (A) as the foundational point from which (B) can be determined or evaluated. For example, 「医者として」 (as a doctor) establishes the role of a doctor as the basis for whatever statement follows.\n\nWhile 「として」 is a combination of these elements, it often functions as a 副助詞 (adverbial particle) in its own right. This means it typically attaches directly to nouns, indicating that the noun functions or is regarded as something specific. This usage emphasizes one particular aspect or role of a person or thing, even if other aspects exist. It implies that the statement (B) is being made solely based on the aspect defined by (A), disregarding other characteristics for that specific context.\n\nThis is a widely used grammatical construction, common across various contexts and demographics in Japanese.",
