    "etymology": "とうとう comes from the kanji 到頭, which literally means 到 (to arrive at) 頭 (the head of/crux of) something.",
    "writeup": "とうとう is an adverb used to express that something 'finally' happens. While Japanese has a few ways to express this, とうとう is common. The structure literally means \"to arrive at the head of/crux of something.\" Thus, 'finally' and 'after all' are the most common translations. Like many adverbs, it's often used at the beginning of a phrase or sentence.\n\nWhile usually written in hiragana, knowing the kanji can help you remember the nuance: something has 'ended', usually after a long journey or effort.\n\nIt can express either positive or negative outcomes, focusing more on the time required to achieve the result. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\nとうとう isn't used when you expect something to happen without effort. For example, you wouldn't use it to say 'Finally, it's summer!' because no one made an effort to achieve that. In these cases, いよいよ is used, which has the nuance of 'finally' or 'at last' in relation to something starting or happening.",
