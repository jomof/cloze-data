    "etymology": "とうとう comes from the kanji 到頭 (とうとう), which literally means 到 (to arrive at) 頭 (the head of/crux of) something. This origin highlights the nuance of reaching an ultimate point after a process or period of time.",
    "writeup": "とうとう is an adverb used to express that something 'finally' happens after a process, effort, or period of waiting. While Japanese has a few ways to express this, とうとう is common. It signifies reaching a culminating point, whether the outcome is positive or negative.\n\nThough usually written in hiragana, understanding its kanji origin (到頭) helps grasp its core nuance: the arrival at the 'head' or 'conclusion' of a matter. This implies a journey or a period of time has elapsed before the final event.\n\nとうとう can be used for both positive and negative outcomes, as its primary focus is on the completion of a sequence or the attainment of a result after a certain duration, rather than the desirability of the result itself.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\nIt is crucial to note that とうとう is typically used when there has been a preceding process, effort, or a discernible period of waiting. It is **not** used for events that occur naturally without human effort or a specific lead-up. For instance, you would not use とうとう to say, \"Finally, summer has come!\" (いよいよ夏が来た！) because the change of seasons is a natural phenomenon that does not involve human effort or a specific period of effortful anticipation in the same way. For such natural occurrences or anticipated beginnings, いよいよ is the more appropriate adverb.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene emphasizes the natural progression and conclusion of a long process, rather than overcoming a specific obstacle, which makes とうとう a slightly more fitting choice than 遂に, which often implies overcoming a challenge."
