    "etymology": "とうとう comes from the kanji 到頭 (とうとう), which literally means 到 (to arrive at) 頭 (the head of/crux of) something. This origin highlights the nuance of reaching an ultimate point after a process or period of time.",
    "writeup": "とうとう is an adverb used to express that something 'finally' happens after a process, effort, or period of waiting. While Japanese has a few ways to express this, とうとう is common. It signifies reaching a culminating point, whether the outcome is positive or negative.\n\nThough usually written in hiragana, understanding its kanji origin (到頭) helps grasp its core nuance: the arrival at the 'head' or 'conclusion' of a matter. This implies a journey or a period of time has elapsed before the final event.\n\nとうとう can be used for both positive and negative outcomes, as its primary focus is on the completion of a sequence or the attainment of a result after a certain duration, rather than the desirability of the result itself.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\nIt is crucial to note that とうとう is typically used when there has been a preceding process, effort, or a discernible period of waiting. It is **not** used for events that occur naturally without human effort or a specific lead-up. For instance, you would not use とうとう to say, \"Finally, summer has come!\" (いよいよ夏が来た！) because the change of seasons is a natural phenomenon that does not involve human effort or a specific period of effortful anticipation in the same way. For such natural occurrences or anticipated beginnings, いよいよ is the more appropriate adverb.",

            "term": "いよいよ",
            "meaning": "At last, finally, more and more",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike とうとう, いよいよ is primarily used when something is about to start or happen, particularly something expected or anticipated, or when a situation is progressing towards a climax or an anticipated state, rather than concluding after effort."

        {
            "term": "遂に (ついに)",
            "meaning": "Finally, at last",
            "kind": "synonym",
            "nuance": "遂に (ついに) is very similar to とうとう. While both mean 'finally,' 遂に often carries a stronger nuance of overcoming difficulties, achieving a goal after significant struggle, or reaching an ultimate, decisive point. とうとう is generally more neutral, simply indicating an outcome after a long period or process, whether positive or negative, and without necessarily implying overcoming great obstacles."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To differentiate these adverbs, consider the context of the 'final' event. いよいよ emphasizes the imminence or progression towards a significant beginning or climax. 遂に (ついに) often highlights a sense of accomplishment or completion after overcoming challenges, indicating that something decisive has been achieved or concluded. とうとう is more broadly used to denote the eventual arrival of a situation or the conclusion of a process, focusing on the passage of time or effort leading to that outcome, without as strong an emphasis on the 'struggle' or 'victory' aspect as 遂に, nor the 'beginning' aspect of いよいよ.",
