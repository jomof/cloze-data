formation:
  '[Verb -て form] + いる': Indicates that something has already happened and is now in a certain state.
    This applies primarily to instantaneous verbs or verbs of change, where the action has completed and
    the resulting state continues.
  '[Verb -て form] + いる + 状態/状況': Used to explicitly state that the resultant state is ongoing, adding
    emphasis to the continuing condition. For example, 「開いている状態」 (a state of being open).
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  usage-context: General everyday usage to describe a state resulting from a completed action or change.
    It focuses on the current condition, not the process that led to it. Often used with verbs that describe
    instantaneous changes like opening, closing, breaking, or dying.
  function: To indicate a resultant state, where an action has occurred and its effect or condition persists.
    It clarifies that the speaker is describing the outcome of an action as a current state.
  nuance: Distinguishes the permanent or ongoing effect of a completed action from the action itself or
    a continuous process. For example, a window that 'has opened' and 'is now open' as opposed to the
    'action of opening'.
  grammatical-role: Functions as an auxiliary verb, attaching to the te-form of a main verb to modify
    its aspect from an action to a state. It transforms a transitive or intransitive verb describing a
    change into an expression of the current condition after that change has taken place.
  temporal-flow: Describes a state that began in the past (due to a completed action) and continues up
    to the present moment, or up to a specific point in the past or future.
etymology: The 「て」 form indicates a connection or sequence, while 「いる」 signifies existence or a continuing
  state. Combined, they describe something that continues from a past action to the present. This grammatical
  structure evolved to express not just continuous actions but also the enduring consequence or outcome
  of an action, emphasizing the 'state of being' rather than the 'act of doing'.
writeup: |-
  This grammar point, 「ている」, indicates a **resultant state**. This means something has happened, and its effect continues to exist. It describes something that *has* been done and is *still* in that state. It's crucial to differentiate this from the 「ている」 form that indicates an ongoing action. This form highlights the *current state* resulting from a completed action, rather than the action itself.

  Verbs that describe a change that is instantaneous and whose result persists often use this form. For instance, actions like 'to die' (死ぬ), 'to break' (壊れる), 'to turn on' (つく), or 'to fall' (落ちる) inherently describe a single, completed event. Once that event occurs, the resultant state continues. You cannot 'die' twice in succession, nor can something 'break' twice without first being fixed. Therefore, when these verbs are used with 「ている」, they describe the *state* that exists as a consequence of that single, completed action.

  Important Considerations:
  *   **Instantaneous Change Verbs**: This form is most commonly used with verbs that denote an instantaneous change, where the action's completion leads to a new, continuing state. Examples include verbs like 開く (to open), 閉まる (to close), 始まる (to begin), 終わる (to end), 結婚する (to marry), 死ぬ (to die), 忘れる (to forget), 太る (to get fat), 痩せる (to get thin), etc.
  *   **Focus on State**: The primary focus is on the *current condition* or state, not the process of change. For example, 「ドアが閉まっている」 means 'the door is closed' (state), not 'the door is closing' (ongoing action).
false_friends:
  - term: ている (~ing)
    meaning: Is, Am, Are (~ing)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「ている (resultant state)」, 「ている (~ing)」 focuses on the *ongoing action* itself, describing
      an action currently in progress. For example, 「本を読んでいる」 (I am reading a book).
    grammar_point: ている (~ing)
  - term: ている (habitual action)
    meaning: Has/have done, Is ~ing (Repetition)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「ている (resultant state)」, 「ている (habitual action)」 emphasizes repetition or habit of
      an action, such as 'I play tennis every Sunday' (毎週テニスをしています).
    grammar_point: ている (habitual action)
  - term: Verb[て] (and then)
    meaning: And, Then (Linking events)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike 「ている (resultant state)」, 「Verb+て」 simply links events in a sequence or states, without
      indicating a lasting state or an action in progress. For example, 「ドアを開けて、中に入った」 (I opened the door
      and went inside).
    grammar_point: Verb[て] (and then)
  - term: つづける
    meaning: To continue
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「ている (resultant state)」, 「つづける」 emphasizes the continuous nature of the action itself,
      not the state resulting from it. It implies an action that keeps going, such as 「走り続ける」 (to keep
      running).
    grammar_point: つづける (to continue)
  - term: てある (resultant state)
    meaning: Something is done, Has been done, Remaining state
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ている (resultant state)」 describes a state resulting from an action, 「てある」 specifically
      implies that the action was performed intentionally, and the state exists because of that preparation
      or intentional act. For example, 「ドアが開けてある」 (The door has been opened (by someone, for a purpose)).
    grammar_point: てある (resultant state)
post_false_friends_writeup: To distinguish 「ている (resultant state)」 from similar expressions, consider
  the focus of the sentence. If it's describing an action in progress, use 「ている (~ing)」. If it describes
  repeated actions, use 「ている (habitual action)」. For a simple sequence of events, 「Verb[て] (and then)」
  is appropriate. When emphasizing the continuous nature of an action, 「つづける」 is used. Finally, if the
  resultant state is due to an intentional or prepared action, 「てある (resultant state)」 is the correct
  choice. The key is whether the emphasis is on the current *state* as a result of a completed action,
  or on the *process* of the action itself, or the *intentionality* behind the state.

  use or interpret this versatile form.
