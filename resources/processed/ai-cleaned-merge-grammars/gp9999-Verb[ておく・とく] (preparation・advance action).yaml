details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  function: Expresses that an action is performed in advance, left undone, or completed for a purpose.
  nuance: The core nuance is performing an action with a future-oriented intent, either for preparation,
    maintenance of a state, or getting something finished.
  colocation: Often used with verbs describing actions that can be completed and whose result can be 'left'
    for later (e.g., 準備する 'to prepare', 買う 'to buy', 書く 'to write').
  grammatical-role: Functions as a secondary verb, modifying the main verb's meaning to add an aspect
    of forethought or preservation.
  logical-flow: 'Implies a causal or preparatory relationship: ''do X now so that Y can happen/exist later''.'
  temporal-flow: Indicates an action completed in the present for a future state or event, or an action
    whose result persists from the past into the present.
  spatial-flow: Can imply 'setting aside' or 'keeping' something in a particular place or state.
etymology: The auxiliary verb 「ておく」 originates from the verb 「置く」 (oku), meaning "to place" or "to put."
  This auxiliary use evolved from the idea of "placing" an action, either by performing it and leaving
  the result, or by doing it ahead of time for a future event. This fundamental meaning of "setting something
  aside" or "leaving it as is" underpins all its nuances, from preparation to maintaining a state.
writeup: |-
  「ておく」 is an extremely versatile auxiliary verb in Japanese, indicating an action performed with a specific purpose in mind, often for the future. It conveys three primary nuances:

  1.  **Preparation**: This is the most common use. It signifies doing something in advance for a future event or purpose. For example, preparing food for a party or studying for a test.
  2.  **Leaving something in a state**: It can mean to perform an action and then leave the result as it is, without further change. This is often seen with things like leaving a window open or keeping a door locked.
  3.  **Completion/Completion for later**: Sometimes, it implies completing an action and leaving it for a future occasion or just getting it out of the way. This nuance can overlap with 「〜てしまう」 in some contexts, but 「ておく」 emphasizes the intention of leaving it ready or finished.

  The casual contractions 「とく」 (from 「ておく」) and 「どく」 (from 「でしておく」 or 「んでおく」, etc.) are very frequently used in spoken Japanese. For example, 「見ておく」 becomes 「見とく」, and 「読んでおく」 becomes 「読んどく」. These contractions are informal and unsuitable for formal settings.
false_friends:
  - term: てしまう
    meaning: To completely do something; to do something unintentionally or regretfully.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「てしまう」 focuses on the completion of an action, often with a sense of finality, regret, or
      accidentalness. While 「ておく」 can also imply completion, its primary focus is on performing an action
      **for a future purpose** or **leaving something in a state**, without the nuance of regret or accident.
      For example, 「食べておいた」 means "I ate it (in preparation/for later)," while 「食べてしまった」 means "I ate
      it all (and it's gone/I regret it)."
    grammar_point: てしまう・ちゃう (completion・regret・accident)
  - term: てある
    meaning: To be in a certain state as a result of someone's action.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「てある」 describes a **state** that exists as a result of a prior, often intentional, action.
      「ておく」 describes the **action** itself, emphasizing the purpose of preparing or leaving something.
      For instance, 「窓が閉めてある」 (The window is closed, having been closed by someone) describes the state,
      whereas 「窓を閉めておく」 (I'll close the window for some purpose) describes the action.
    grammar_point: てある (resultant state)
  - term: てみる
    meaning: To try doing something.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both involve a prior action, 「ておく」 is about performing an action with a future intention
      or to leave something in a state. 「てみる」 is about attempting an action to see what happens, implying
      experimentation. They are distinct in their core meanings.
    grammar_point: てみる (try and see)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between 「ておく」 and 「てしまう」, remember that 「ておく」 often has
  a forward-looking purpose or denotes leaving something as is, while 「てしまう」 typically conveys completion,
  regret, or an unintentional outcome. For 「てある」, the key difference is that it describes the **state**
  of an object or situation as a result of a past action, rather than the act of performing that action
  for a future purpose like 「ておく」. 「てみる」, on the other hand, implies an experimental attempt, which is
  quite different from preparing or leaving something.

    setting: informative
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    nuance: This example uses the negative form 「やらないでおく」, which means "to not do something and leave
      it undone." It highlights the nuance of neglecting a preparatory action or intentionally leaving
      something in an incomplete state. The advice given here implies that such an attitude is not beneficial.
post_example_writeup: Understanding the core concept of "doing something and setting it aside" or "leaving
  something in a particular state" is crucial for mastering 「ておく」. Pay close attention to the context
  to discern whether it implies preparation, maintaining a state, or simply getting something finished
  for later.
