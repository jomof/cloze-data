  occurs, or by which something is measured, grouped, or sold. It delineates the smallest or standard
  division of a quantity, time, or category. This phrase is highly versatile, applicable across various
  contexts from financial transactions and academic analyses to daily purchases and organizational structures.

  yen,' or with nouns to define a conceptual unit, such as 'by department' or 'per page.'

  - term: ずつ
    meaning: each; apiece; one by one
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「単位で」 refers to measurements or groupings, 「ずつ」 implies distributing something equally
      or individually. For example, 「一人ずつ」 (hitori zutsu) means "one person each," emphasizing distribution,
      whereas 「一人単位で」 (hitori tan'i de) would focus on individuals as units in a structured group.
    grammar_point: ずつ (each; one at a time; little by little)
  - term: ごとに
    meaning: every; each; at intervals of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ごとに」 indicates intervals or frequencies. 「5分ごとに」 (go fun goto ni) means "every 5 minutes"
      (a regular occurrence), while 「5分単位で」 (go fun tan'i de) refers to something measured in 5-minute
      increments (the standard unit of time).
    grammar_point: ごとに (each・every)
post_false_friends_writeup: The distinction between 「単位で」, 「ずつ」, and 「ごとに」 lies in what each grammar point
  emphasizes. 「単位で」 is about measurement or organization into units, 「ずつ」 is about equal distribution,
  and 「ごとに」 is about regular intervals. Understanding these differences will help you choose the correct
  expression for your intended meaning.
examples:
  - english: This vending machine only accepts payments in 100-yen increments.
    japanese:
      - この 自動 販売 機 は 100 円 {単位 で} しか 使え ませ ん。
      - この 自動 販売 機 は 100 円 {単位 で} ない と 使え ませ ん。
      - この 自動 販売 機、100 円 {単位 で} しか 使え ない よ。
    english_literally: This vending machine, only in 100-yen units, cannot be used.

          - この 自動 販売 機 は 100 円 {ずつ} しか 使え ませ ん。
        english: This vending machine only accepts 100 yen one by one.
        hint: 「ずつ」 emphasizes distribution of individual items, not the minimum accepted unit. We're looking
          for how payments are measured.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 自動 販売 機 は 100 円 {ごと に} しか 使え ませ ん。
        english: This vending machine only accepts payments every 100 yen.
        hint: 「ごとに」 refers to regular intervals or frequency, not the unit of transaction. We're looking

    scene: A person is attempting to buy a drink from a vending machine, but is having trouble because
      they only have large bills.

    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The use of 「しか使えません」 clearly indicates a limitation or restriction, emphasizing that payments
      must be made in 100-yen units and nothing smaller. The casual alternative 「使えないよ」 is common in informal
      settings and softens the statement with the sentence-final particle 「よ」.

      in a shared calendar.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The polite request 「調整してください」 is appropriate for a manager giving instructions to a team in
      a professional setting, maintaining a respectful tone. The alternative 「調整をお願いします」 offers a slightly
      softer, more indirect request, often preferred in professional contexts to imply collaboration rather
      than a direct command.

      of a particular item.

    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male

      an informative retail setting. 「売っています」 is a more direct, active statement meaning 'we sell' or
      'they sell,' while 「売られています」 is another passive form, slightly less formal than 「販売されています」 but still
      polite, both conveying the same meaning regarding the selling unit.

        hint: 「ずつ」 implies a distribution or sequential approach, like handling one department before

          for implementation.

          - 来月 から 部署 {ごと に} 新しい システム を 導入 し ます。
        english: From next month, we will introduce the new system for each department.
        hint: 「ごとに」 suggests repetition for each item in a group or at regular intervals. We're looking

      a new operational system.

      and politeness, appropriate for a senior executive addressing a large group in a professional setting.

      assignments are due.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: female

    nuance: 「提出します」 is a standard polite way to express submitting something. 「出します」 is also polite and
      commonly used, being a more general verb for 'to put out' or 'to submit.' The casual 「出すんだよ」 uses
      the explanatory particle 「んだ」 (n'da) and the sentence-final particle 「よ」, which is very common among
      female speakers to provide information or explanation to a close peer.

        english: The data was analyzed city by city (one after another), and regional differences became
          clear.
        hint: 「ずつ」 emphasizes a sequential or individual processing of each city. We're looking for how
          each city was treated as a distinct unit for comprehensive analysis, not just a step-by-step
          process.

      an objective description. 「分析され、地域差が明らかになりました」 offers a slightly more direct and commonly used polite
      form of reporting findings. 「分析されていて、地域差が明らかになった」 uses the 「～ていて」 form, implying a continuous state
      or an ongoing analysis leading to the result, while maintaining a formal but less stiff tone.

      manner. This expression is natural for a female speaker to a close acquaintance.
post_example_writeup: The expression 「単位で」 provides a flexible way to talk about how things are measured,
  sold, or grouped. Being able to use it naturally is important for understanding and conveying precise
  information in Japanese.
