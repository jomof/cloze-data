  - term: 自体 (じたい)
    meaning: itself
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「自体」 emphasizes a thing itself, but doesn't carry the same nuance of something being the perfect
      example of something like 「そのもの」 does. 「問題自体」 can be used when explaining the origin of a problem,
      but 「問題そのもの」 would be a stronger assertion that something is a problem.
    grammar_point: 自体 (itself)
  - term: 自身 (じしん)
    meaning: oneself
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「自身」 refers to a person themselves or one's own being, whereas 「そのもの」 emphasizes the inherent
      nature or essence of a thing.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:自身 (oneself)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「自体」 and 「自身」 are similar and sometimes interchangeable with 「そのもの」,
  it's important to remember the specific nuances each carries. 「自体」 focuses on the thing itself, 「自身」
  refers to oneself, and 「そのもの」 highlights the very essence or a perfect example of something.
