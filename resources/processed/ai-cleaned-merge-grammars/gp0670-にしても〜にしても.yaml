        "usage-context": "general",
        "function": "To state that a certain outcome or conclusion is valid irrespective of two contrasting conditions or possibilities.",
        "nuance": "This pattern emphasizes the inevitability or consistency of the outcome despite varying circumstances. It can convey a slightly softer nuance than 「にしろ〜にしろ」 or 「にせよ〜にせよ」, making it suitable for a wider range of standard communication."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にしても」 is formed from the particle 「に」 (indicating a point of focus or condition), the te-form of the verb 「する」 (to do), which is 「して」, and the particle 「も」 (meaning 'even' or 'also'). The repetition of 「にしても」 (A にしても B にしても) emphasizes that the subsequent statement holds true for both A and B, effectively meaning 'even if A, and even if B'.",
    "writeup": "The 「にしても〜にしても」 grammar pattern (often seen as 〜にしても〜にしても or just 〜にしても when the second clause is implied) expresses that a certain outcome or statement holds true **regardless** of two contrasting conditions or possibilities. It can be translated as \"regardless of whether... or...\" or \"whether... or...\". This pattern is versatile, attaching to various parts of speech in their plain forms: verbs, nouns, and adjectives (both い-adjectives and な-adjectives). It is frequently used with a verb and its negative counterpart (e.g., 「するにしても、しないにしても」), but it can also connect any two contrasting elements, emphasizing that the conclusion is inevitable or valid despite the differing conditions.\n\nWhile 「にしても」 is often used in this repeated A にしても B にしても form, it can also appear as a single 「にしても」 clause, implying the alternative or setting a general condition. For instance, 「忙しいにしても、連絡ぐらいはできるはずだ」 (Even if you're busy, you should at least be able to contact me) uses a single instance to mean \"even if\" or \"granting that\".\n\nIt is important to note the close relationship between 「にしても」, 「にしろ」, and 「にせよ」. All three can convey a similar meaning of \"regardless of whether\" or \"even if\". However, 「にしろ」 and 「にせよ」 tend to be more direct and are therefore less commonly used in highly formal situations. 「にしても」 offers a slightly softer nuance, making it a more broadly applicable choice in standard speech.",
