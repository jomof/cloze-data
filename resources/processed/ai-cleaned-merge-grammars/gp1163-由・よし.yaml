    "writeup": "The grammar point 「由・よし」 is used to convey information that one has learned from another source. It's similar to saying \"I heard that...\" or \"It is said that...\" in English. This grammar point is most often encountered in formal writing and speech, such as business letters or official announcements. It adds a level of politeness and formality to the statement. It is more formal than 「とのこと」. In modern Japanese, 「由」 is more commonly written in kanji, but it can also be written in hiragana.",
