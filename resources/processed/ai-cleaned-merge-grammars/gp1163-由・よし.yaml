        "part-of-speech": "noun",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Primarily in formal writing and formal speech, such as business correspondence, official announcements, or polite conversations when relaying information received from a third party.",
        "function": "Conveys information obtained from a source, emphasizing that the speaker is merely reporting it, rather than stating it as a fact of their own knowledge.",
        "nuance": "Adds a highly formal and polite tone, implying the information is reliable but not directly observed by the speaker. It suggests the information is taken from a trusted source, often for important news or announcements.",
        "counterpoint": "とのこと (to no koto) - similar meaning, but can be slightly less formal."
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「由」 originally meant \"reason\" or \"cause.\" Over time, it evolved to also indicate the source or origin of information, hence its use to convey \"I heard from the source that...\". Its association with formal contexts likely stems from its historical use in official documents and classical texts.",
    "writeup": "「由・よし」 is a dependent noun used to convey information that one has learned from another source, functioning similarly to \"I heard that...\" or \"It is said that...\" in English. This grammar point primarily appears in **formal writing** and **formal speech**, often in settings like business correspondence, official announcements, or polite conversations where information is being relayed from a third party.\n\nThe core function of 「由・よし」 is to indicate that the preceding statement is information received, rather than a direct observation or personal knowledge of the speaker. This adds a layer of **politeness and objectivity** to the statement, making it suitable for situations requiring a respectful or professional tone. It implicitly asserts that the information is from a reliable source.\n\nWhile 「由・よし」 can be encountered in both written and spoken forms, its usage in modern Japanese conversation is quite limited, usually reserved for highly formal or solemn occasions. It is **more formal** than similar expressions like 「とのこと」, which is more commonly used in general polite conversation. Although 「由」 is its primary kanji, it can also be written in hiragana as 「よし」, particularly when emphasizing its phonetic value or to avoid overly stiff kanji usage in certain contexts. However, in formal documents, the kanji 「由」 is generally preferred.",

                    "mitigation": "While 「とのこと」 is polite, 「由」 elevates the formality and respect, befitting the written business context for highly significant news. The scene highlights the written, formal nature of the communication."

            "nuance": "The usage of highly honorific language like 「御社」 (your company) and 「ご清栄」 (flourishing prosperity) combined with 「お慶び申し上げます」 (I sincerely congratulate you) demands the utmost formality. 「由」 is perfectly suited here to convey information about the company's prosperity from a reliable, perhaps official, source, maintaining the solemnity and professionalism of the congratulation."
