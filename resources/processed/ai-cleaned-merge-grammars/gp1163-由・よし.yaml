    "etymology": "The word 「由」 originally meant \"reason\" or \"cause.\" Over time, it evolved to also indicate the source or origin of information, hence its use to convey \"I heard from the source that...\". Its association with formal contexts likely stems from its historical use in official documents and classical texts.",
    "writeup": "「由・よし」 is a dependent noun used to convey information that one has learned from another source, functioning similarly to \"I heard that...\" or \"It is said that...\" in English. This grammar point primarily appears in **formal writing** and **formal speech**, often in settings like business correspondence, official announcements, or polite conversations where information is being relayed from a third party.\n\nThe core function of 「由・よし」 is to indicate that the preceding statement is information received, rather than a direct observation or personal knowledge of the speaker. This adds a layer of **politeness and objectivity** to the statement, making it suitable for situations requiring a respectful or professional tone. It implicitly asserts that the information is from a reliable source.\n\nWhile 「由・よし」 can be encountered in both written and spoken forms, its usage in modern Japanese conversation is quite limited, usually reserved for highly formal or solemn occasions. It is **more formal** than similar expressions like 「とのこと」, which is more commonly used in general polite conversation. Although 「由」 is its primary kanji, it can also be written in hiragana as 「よし」, particularly when emphasizing its phonetic value or to avoid overly stiff kanji usage in certain contexts. However, in formal documents, the kanji 「由」 is generally preferred.",
