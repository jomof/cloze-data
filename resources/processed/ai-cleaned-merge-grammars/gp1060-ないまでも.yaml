        "usage-context": "General",
        "function": "Expresses concession, indicating that while a high degree or ideal state is not reached, a certain lower degree or state is still true or desirable.",
        "nuance": "This pattern emphasizes a gradient or scale, suggesting that an ultimate or ideal condition (A) is not fulfilled, but a significant, albeit lesser, condition (B) nonetheless holds true or is attained. It often implies a sense of reality check or setting a minimum acceptable standard.",
        "colocation": "Often followed by expressions of desire, suggestion, or necessity, such as たい (tai), てほしい (te hoshii), てください (te kudasai), たらどう (tara dou), つもり (tsumori), といい (to ii)."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ないまでも」 is a compound expression derived from the negative auxiliary verb 「ない」 (nai, 'not'), the particle 「まで」 (made, 'until' or 'to the extent of'), and the particle 「も」 (mo, 'even' or 'also'). Literally, it means \"even if it does not reach (a certain point or extent).\" This combination allows it to convey a sense of concession, implying that while an ideal or expected level is not attained, some lesser but still significant aspect is true or desirable. Historically, 「まで」 marks an endpoint or limit, and 「も」 adds emphasis, suggesting that even at that limited point, something holds true.",
    "writeup": "「ないまでも」 is a versatile grammar pattern used to express a concession, indicating that while a certain ideal or high degree is not reached, something of a lesser but still significant degree is true or desirable. It combines the negative form of a verb or adjective with 「まで」 (until/to the extent of) and 「も」 (even/also).\n\nThis pattern inherently presents a scale or gradient: an extreme or ideal state (A) is acknowledged as not being achieved, but a lower, undeniable extent or state (B) is confirmed. The literal interpretation can be understood as \"even if not reaching (A), (B).\"\n\nFor verbs, it attaches to the negative plain form: Verb -ない + までも。\nFor い-adjectives, it attaches to the く-form of the negative: い-Adjective stem + くない + までも。\nFor nouns and な-adjectives, it attaches to the negative copula: Noun/な-Adjective + ではない/じゃ + ないまでも。\n\nOften, the B phrase will convey a wish, demand, or a statement of what is still true, frequently utilizing structures like 「たい」 (want to), 「てほしい」 (want someone to do), 「てください」 (please do), 「たらどう」 (how about), 「つもり」 (intend to), or 「といい」 (it would be good if).",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「ないまでも」 conveys a sense of concession on a scale, meaning 'even if the ideal isn't met, at least a lower level is true,' expressions like 「～なくても」 and 「～とは言えないが」 serve different purposes. 「～なくても」 is a conditional meaning 'even without' or 'even if not,' without the inherent implication of a gradient or a minimum achieved. 「～とは言えないが」 is about the speaker's direct statement, suggesting that a certain label or description cannot be precisely applied, but something else is true. These differences are subtle but crucial for natural Japanese expression, ensuring you choose the right nuance to convey the exact relationship between the ideal and the reality.",
