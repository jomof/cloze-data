    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ないまでも」 is derived from 「ない」 (nai - not), 「まで」 (made - until, to the extent of), and 「も」 (mo - even). It literally means \"even if it doesn't reach (a certain point).\" The implication is that while the ideal or expected level may not be attained, some lesser but still significant aspect is still true or desirable.",
    "writeup": "「ないまでも」 combines the negative form of a verb or adjective with 「まで」 (until) and 「も」 (even). It conveys that even if something doesn't reach a certain extreme, at least something else is true or desirable. The pattern presents an extreme (A) that isn't reached, but a lower extent (B) is undeniable. The literal sense is, \"even though not reaching (A), (B).\" This is often used to express a wish or demand, using structures like 「たい」, 「てほしい」, 「てください」, 「たらどう」, 「つもり」, or 「といい」 in the (B) phrase.",
