    "etymology": "The grammar point involves directly attaching an い-adjective to a noun. This is a fundamental way to describe the qualities of the noun. The い-adjective retains its dictionary form before the noun.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese, い-adjectives directly precede and modify nouns, describing their qualities. This is a fundamental concept. An important point to remember is the visual distinction of い-adjectives: the 「い」 will typically appear *outside* any kanji that form the word. For example, 「面白い」 (omoshiroi, interesting) clearly shows the 「い」 separated from the kanji. Conversely, words like 「きれい」 (kirei, clean) might seem to end in 「い」, but because the 「い」 is part of the kanji character itself (or is a common way to write it), they are in fact な-adjectives. While there are very few exceptions, such as 「嫌い」 (kirai, hate), where the 「い」 appears outside the kanji but it is still a な-adjective, these are rare. This rule of thumb is generally reliable.",
