    "etymology": "This grammar point involves directly attaching an い-adjective to a noun. This fundamental structure allows for the direct description of the noun's qualities. The い-adjective maintains its dictionary form when preceding the noun.",
    "writeup": "In Japanese, い-adjectives directly precede and modify nouns, specifying their qualities. This is a foundational concept. An important distinction to remember when identifying い-adjectives is their visual structure: the 「い」 will typically appear *outside* any kanji that form the word. For example, 「面白い」 (omoshiroi, interesting) clearly shows the 「い」 separated from its kanji. Conversely, words like 「きれい」 (kirei, clean) might end in 「い」 phonetically, but because this 「い」 is integral to the kanji character or is a common way to write it, they are classified as な-adjectives. While there are a very small number of exceptions, such as 「嫌い」 (kirai, hate), where the 「い」 appears outside the kanji yet it remains a な-adjective, these cases are rare. This general rule for visual identification is largely reliable.",
