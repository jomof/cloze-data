    "etymology": "This grammar point is a combination of the 「〜ても」 form (even if) and the 「〜なくても」 form (even if not). It creates a structure where both the affirmative and negative possibilities are considered, indicating that the outcome remains the same regardless of the condition.",
    "writeup": "The 「〜ても〜なくても」 construction expresses \"whether or not.\" It signifies that a particular outcome or situation remains unchanged regardless of whether a certain condition is met or not. It's like saying \"even if (A), even if not (A).\" The verb, noun, or adjective before 「ても」 and 「なくても」 should be the same. For verbs, it uses the 「て」 form and the 「ない」 form. For nouns, you use 「で」 and 「でなくても」. For adjectives, it uses the 「て」 form and the 「なくて」 form.",
