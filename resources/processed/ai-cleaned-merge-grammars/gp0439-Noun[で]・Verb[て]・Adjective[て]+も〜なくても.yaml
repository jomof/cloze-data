    "etymology": "This grammar point is a combination of the 「〜ても」 form (even if) and the 「〜なくても」 form (even if not). It creates a structure where both the affirmative and negative possibilities are considered, indicating that the outcome remains the same regardless of the condition.",
    "writeup": "The 「〜ても〜なくても」 structure is used to express that an outcome or situation remains constant, regardless of whether a particular condition is met or not. It conveys a sense of inevitability or indifference to the condition. Literally translated as 'even if (X) or even if not (X)', it emphasizes that the consequence is fixed, making the condition irrelevant.\n\nThis pattern is versatile and can be applied to verbs, adjectives, and nouns:\n*   **Verbs**: Use the **te-form** followed by も, and the **ない-form + くても**. For example, 「行っても行かなくても」 (whether you go or don't go).\n*   **い-Adjectives**: Use the **te-form** (e.g., 寒くても) followed by も, and the **ない-form + くても** (e.g., 寒くなくても). For example, 「良くても良くなくても」 (whether it's good or not good).\n*   **な-Adjectives/Nouns**: Use **で** followed by も, and **でなくても**. For example, 「静かでも静かでなくても」 (whether it's quiet or not quiet) or 「学生でも学生でなくても」 (whether you're a student or not a student).\n\nThe core meaning is that the *outcome* is unaffected by the presence or absence of the condition. It often implies a definitive stance, a resigned acceptance, or a statement of universal truth. Unlike 「かどうか」 which primarily expresses uncertainty or asking 'if/whether', 「〜ても〜なくても」 confirms that the outcome is already known and unchanging regardless of the condition.\n\nWhile generally standard in register, certain nuances might be perceived based on the context and choice of words. For instance, ending a sentence with 「〜ないわ」 after using this pattern can give a distinctly feminine and reflective tone, as seen in Example 4. Similarly, a blunt refusal using 「〜しないよ」 might sound more typical of male speech in certain casual, direct contexts (Example 9).",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「〜ても〜なくても」 effectively conveys that a result is fixed regardless of a condition, other expressions exist with subtle differences. For instance, 「〜かどうか」 is used to express uncertainty or inquiry. 「〜ようが〜まいが」 carries a stronger, more emphatic nuance of determination or indifference, often implying a speaker's strong will despite the circumstances. 「〜にかかわらず」 tends to be more formal and directly translates to 'regardless of', focusing on a broad applicability rather than the specific affirmative/negative pairing. When choosing, consider if you are stating a factual unchangeable outcome (「〜ても〜なくても」), expressing uncertainty (「〜かどうか」), or emphasizing personal resolve (「〜ようが〜まいが」).",
