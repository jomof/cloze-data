    "etymology": "「じゃない」is a contraction of 「ではない」. 「では」 is the particle 「で」 followed by the topic marker 「は」. 「ない」is the negative form of 「ある」.",
    "writeup": "「じゃない」 is the casual form of 「ではない」. The form 「では」 is regularly contracted to 「じゃ」 in Japanese, so it's useful to remember this contraction.\n\n「じゃない」(casual) or 「ではない」(semi-polite) are the structures used to create the negative form of nouns and *na*-adjectives. These structures are simply added to the base form of the noun or *na*-adjective. 「じゃ」 and 「では」 can also be used with the negative *masu* form of 「ある」, to create the polite variant.\n\nIn very casual speech, 「ない」 is sometimes said/written as 「ね」 or 「ねえ」. However, this is considered very casual, or even a bit rough, so it is best avoided in most conversations.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n「じゃない」 is used very frequently to ask questions, similar to 「じゃないか」. However, the nuance is that 「じゃない」 as a question is a little more blunt, like \"isn't it?\" in English. On the other hand, 「じゃないか」 is more like \"don't you think?\". When 「じゃない」 is used as a question, it will usually be obvious due to a rising tone.",
