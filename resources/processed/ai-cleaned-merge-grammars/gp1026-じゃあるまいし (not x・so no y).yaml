details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: General usage, often in conversations where the speaker is expressing disapproval or
    criticism, particularly when addressing an individual or a situation that exhibits behavior deemed
    inconsistent with reality or common sense.
  function: To criticize behavior or an attitude by pointing out that the premise for such behavior (implied
    by the preceding clause) is clearly false or inappropriate, suggesting a disparity between expectation
    and reality.
  nuance: Carries a strong tone of exasperation, reproach, or indignation. It implies that the listener's
    action is unfitting or absurd given the reality of the situation, often suggesting a lack of common
    sense, maturity, or a misunderstanding on the part of the listener. It's a direct challenge to the
    appropriateness of actions based on a denied premise.
etymology: The expression 「じゃあるまいし」 is a combination of several linguistic elements. 「じゃ」 is a colloquial
  contraction of the particle 「では」, indicating a condition or contrast. 「ある」 is the plain form of the
  verb 'to be'. 「まい」 is an auxiliary verb indicating negative volition or conjecture, similar to 'would
  not' or 'not likely', suggesting something is not the case or not intended. Finally, 「し」 is a conjunctive
  particle used to state a reason or add emphasis, often implying 'and so' or 'for that reason'. Together,
  these elements form a phrase that literally means 'it is not as if [X], so therefore [Y]', where Y is
  a criticism or observation of an inappropriate action or attitude. This linguistic construction reveals
  its historical development as a firm, often exasperated, denial followed by a logical consequence.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「じゃあるまいし」 is a sophisticated and emotionally charged phrase used in Japanese to express that a certain situation, identity, or premise is **not** the case, and as a direct consequence, the subsequent behavior or expectation is inappropriate, illogical, or even absurd. It functions much like saying, "You're not X, so why are you acting like Y?" or "It's not X, so this Y is ridiculous."

  Predominantly found in casual conversation, 「じゃあるまいし」 carries a strong nuance of reproach, exasperation, or indignation. The speaker employs this expression to highlight a significant discrepancy between the reality of the listener (or a situation) and their actions, often implying a lack of common sense, maturity, or understanding. This grammar point implicitly denies a false premise, then uses that denial to criticize. For example, if someone is crying profusely over a minor scratch, one might say 「赤ちゃんじゃあるまいし」 (You're not a baby, so...). This denies the implied premise that they are a baby, which would otherwise justify such an extreme reaction.

  The construction of 「じゃあるまいし」 involves several linguistic components: 「じゃ」 is a colloquial contraction of the particle 「では」, serving to set a condition or contrast. 「ある」 is the plain form of the verb "to be." 「まい」 is an auxiliary verb that conveys negative volition or conjecture, akin to "would not" or "not likely." Finally, 「し」 acts as a conjunctive particle to provide a reason or add emphasis. Together, these elements form a phrase that literally conveys "it is not as if [X], so therefore [Y]," where Y is a critical observation or a judgment regarding an inappropriate action or attitude.

  You will frequently encounter 「じゃあるまいし」 when someone is gently scolding or firmly rebuking another person, particularly younger individuals or those exhibiting immature behavior. Its colloquial nature makes it well-suited for informal or semi-formal settings, though generally unsuitable for highly formal or deferential speech. The clause that follows 「じゃあるまいし」 typically articulates the speaker's judgment, often taking the form of a command, a suggestion, or a rhetorical question that underscores the unsuitability of the behavior. The overall tone of the sentence usually leans towards a negative assessment of the criticized action.
false_friends:
  - term: ～わけではない・～というわけではない
    meaning: It's not necessarily the case that... / It doesn't mean that...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both expressions involve denial, 「～わけではない・～というわけではない」 is a factual denial or clarification,
      often used to soften a negative statement or point out that something is not always true. 「じゃあるまいし」,
      on the other hand, is a strong, often exasperated, denial followed by a direct criticism of behavior
      or attitude. It carries a much stronger emotional tone and implies impropriety, rather than just
      stating a fact.
    grammar_point: わけではない (not necessarily)
  - term: ～はずがない
    meaning: There's no way (that)... / It couldn't possibly be...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～はずがない」 expresses a strong logical impossibility or certainty of denial regarding a fact
      or event. 「じゃあるまいし」 also denies a premise, but its primary function is to follow up with a judgment
      or criticism about *behavior* that stems from that false premise. 「じゃあるまいし」 is more about criticizing
      conduct based on a denied identity or condition, whereas 「～はずがない」 is about denying the possibility
      or existence of a fact.
    grammar_point: はずがない (logical impossibility)
  - term: ～どころではない
    meaning: This is no time/place for... / Far from it...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '「～どころではない」 indicates that a certain action or situation is entirely out of the question or
      inappropriate given the current circumstances or priorities. While it also expresses inappropriateness,
      「じゃあるまいし」 specifically denies an identity or a premise to criticize behavior, whereas 「～どころではない」
      focuses on the timing, suitability, or feasibility of an action within a given context. The core
      difference lies in the *source* of inappropriateness: denied premise vs. unsuitable circumstance.'
    grammar_point: どころではない (not the time or place for)
post_false_friends_writeup: While expressions like 「～わけではない」, 「～はずがない」, and 「～どころではない」 also involve denial
  or inappropriateness, they differ significantly from 「じゃあるまいし」 in nuance and function. 「～わけではない」 is
  a factual denial, simply stating that something is not necessarily true. 「～はずがない」 expresses a strong
  logical impossibility. 「～どころではない」 indicates that something is unsuitable or impossible given the current
  circumstances. In contrast, 「じゃあるまいし」 specifically denies an identity or a clear premise as a foundation
  for criticizing someone's behavior or attitude, implying that their actions are childish, illogical,
  or unwarranted based on reality. It always carries a strong, often exasperated, tone of reproach. Understanding
  these distinctions helps in choosing the most appropriate expression to convey the precise nuance of
  denial and criticism.
examples:
  - english: You're no longer a university student, so stop asking your parents for pocket money every
      day.
    japanese:
      - もう 大学 生 {じゃ ある まい し}、毎日 親 に お 小遣い を ねだる の は やめ なさい。
      - もう 大学 生 {じゃ ある まい し}、毎日 親 に 小遣い ねだる の は やめ とけ よ。
      - 大 学生 {じゃ ある まい し}、いつ まで 親 に 小遣い を 頼む ん だ い？
    english_literally: It is not as if you are a university student, so stop begging your parents for
      pocket money every day.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 大学 生 な の に、毎日 親 に お 小遣い を ねだる の は やめ なさい。
        english: Even though you are a university student, stop asking your parents for pocket money every
          day.
        hint: This uses 'のに' to express a contradictory situation, but it lacks the strong reproaching
          tone of 'じゃあるまいし'. We're looking for a strong denial of the premise followed by a criticism
          of the resulting action.
    scene: A mother is scolding her adult son who still lives at home and relies on her financially.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The speaker uses 「じゃあるまいし」 to express frustration and criticize the son's lack of independence,
      implying that his current behavior is inappropriate for his age and status as an adult. The ending
      「やめなさい」 is a firm but not overly harsh command, typical of a parent.
    etymology: The phrase 「お 小遣い を ねだる」 means 'to beg for pocket money,' combining 「小遣い」 (pocket money)
      with 「ねだる」 (to plead, to beg). This behavior is often associated with children, highlighting the
      discrepancy when an adult engages in it, which 「じゃあるまいし」 emphasizes for rhetorical effect.
  - english: It's not the middle of summer, so there's no need to dress so warmly.
    japanese:
      - 真夏 {じゃ ある まい し}、こんな に 厚着 する 必要 は ない だろう。
      - 真夏 {じゃ ある まい し}、そんな 厚着 必要 ない よ。
      - 真夏 {じゃ ある まい し}、なん で そんな に 厚着 し てる の？
    english_literally: It is not as if it is the middle of summer, so there is no need to dress so warmly.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 真夏 で も ない から、こんな に 厚着 する 必要 は ない だろう。
        english: Because it's not even midsummer, there's no need to dress so warmly.
        hint: This uses 'から' to state a reason, but it lacks the critical and exasperated nuance of 'じゃあるまいし'
          that implies the action is absurd or unwarranted.
    scene: A friend comments on their companion's excessive clothing on a mild autumn day, feeling a bit
      amused.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: Here, 「じゃあるまいし」 expresses a mild, almost humorous criticism of dressing too warmly. It points
      out the obvious discrepancy between the actual weather and the clothing choice, implying it's a
      bit unnecessary or silly. The use of 「だろう」 softens the statement.
    etymology: 「厚着」 (あつぎ) combines 「厚い」 (あつい, thick/heavy) and 「着る」 (きる, to wear), literally meaning 'heavy
      clothing'. It's naturally used when one's attire seems excessive for the prevailing weather, which
      is precisely the situation this critiques.
  - english: It's not like you're going to become a professional musician, so isn't it fine to just enjoy
      playing an instrument as a hobby?
    japanese:
      - プロ の 音楽 家 に なる {わけ じゃ ある まい し}、趣味 で 楽器 を 楽しむ くらい で いい ん じゃ ない？
      - プロ の 音楽 家 に なる {わけ じゃ ある まい し}、無理 する こと ない だろ。
      - プロ の 音楽 家 に なる {わけ じゃ ある まい し}、肩 の 力 抜き な よ。
    english_literally: It is not as if you are going to become a professional musician, so isn't it fine
      to just enjoy playing an instrument to that extent as a hobby?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - プロ の 音楽 家 に なる つもり なら、趣味 で 楽器 を 楽しむ くらい で は いけ ない。
        english: If you intend to become a professional musician, then enjoying an instrument as a hobby
          is not enough.
        hint: This expresses a conditional statement where the premise is true, leading to a different
          conclusion. We're looking for a firm denial of a premise that makes the following behavior inappropriate.
    scene: A father advises his daughter who is putting too much pressure on herself to excel at music,
      wanting her to relax and enjoy.
    register: casual
    setting: supportive
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: This example uses 「わけじゃあるまいし」 to alleviate pressure, suggesting that the listener's effort
      is disproportionate to their actual goal. The nuance is supportive, telling them it's okay not to
      be perfect and to find joy in the activity. The final 「んじゃない？」 makes it a gentle suggestion. The
      phrase 「肩 の 力 抜きなよ」 literally means 'take the strength out of your shoulders,' idiomatically meaning
      'relax' or 'take it easy.'
    etymology: The idiom 「肩 の 力 を 抜く」 (かた の ちから を ぬく) literally means 'to remove strength from one's shoulders.'
      It originated from physical activities like sports or martial arts where excessive tension (strength
      in shoulders) hinders performance, evolving to mean relaxing mentally or not being overly stressed
      or serious.
  - english: It's not like your life is over with one failure, so don't be so down.
    japanese:
      - 一 回 の 失敗 で 人生 が 終わる {わけ じゃ ある まい し}、そんな に 落ち込む な よ。
      - 一 回 の 失敗 で 人生 が 終わる {わけ じゃ ある まい し}、大丈夫 だ って。
      - 一 回 の 失敗 で 人生 が 終わる {わけ じゃ ある まい し}、元気 出し て。
    english_literally: It is not as if life ends with one failure, so do not get so depressed.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 一 回 の 失敗 で 人生 が 終わる わけ で は ない から、そんな に 落ち込む な よ。
        english: Because it's not the case that life ends with one failure, don't be so down.
        hint: This uses 'わけではないから' which is a factual denial followed by a reason. 'じゃあるまいし' adds a stronger
          tone of disbelief and criticism of the listener's exaggerated reaction.
    scene: A senior colleague encouraging a disheartened junior colleague after a significant setback
      in a project, trying to put things in perspective.
    register: casual
    setting: sympathetic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: Here, 「わけじゃあるまいし」 is used to console someone, pointing out that their exaggerated reaction
      to a minor setback is unwarranted. It's a gentle but firm attempt to make them see the reality of
      the situation, implying they should not be so dramatic. The casual 「なよ」 is appropriate for a senior
      to a junior colleague. The phrase 「元気 出して」 means 'cheer up' or 'brighten up,' a common expression
      of encouragement.
    etymology: 「落ち込む」 (おちこむ) literally means 'to fall in' or 'to sink,' and metaphorically it is used
      to describe a state of being depressed or disheartened, as if one has fallen into a low emotional
      state. The expression emphasizes a negative change from a previous, more positive state.
  - english: It's not even during business hours yet, so why are you trying to close the store now?
    japanese:
      - まだ 営業 時間 中 {じゃ ある まい し}、なん で 今 店 を 閉めよう と し て いる ん です か？
      - まだ 営業 時間 中 {じゃ ある まい し}、今 閉める 必要 ある の？
      - まだ 営業 時間 中 {じゃ ある まい し}、なぜ 今 お 店 を 閉めよう と さ れ て いる の です か？
    english_literally: It is not as if it is still within business hours, so why are you trying to close
      the store now?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - まだ 営業 時間 中 な の に、なん で 今 店 を 閉めよう と し て いる ん です か？
        english: Even though it's still business hours, why are you trying to close the store now?
        hint: This uses 'のに' to express a sense of contradiction or surprise. 'じゃあるまいし' adds a stronger
          sense of incredulity and criticism that the action is baseless given the premise.
    scene: A female manager questioning a male employee who is prematurely closing the store before the
      official closing time.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: interrogative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker is expressing surprise and disapproval at the employee's action, questioning their
      judgment. 「じゃあるまいし」 emphasizes that the premise for closing (that it's past business hours) is false.
      The use of 「んですか？」 makes it an inquiring but firm question, suitable for a manager. The use of 「なぜ」
      and 「されているのですか」 in the last variation makes it more formal and respectful, fitting the semi-formal
      register.
    etymology: 「営業 時間」 (えいぎょう じかん) directly translates to 'business hours,' combining 「営業」 (えいぎょう, business/operations)
      and 「時間」 (じかん, time). The phrase is self-explanatory, referring to the specific hours when a business
      is open or operating.
  - english: You're not a child, so stop playing on your smartphone during meals.
    japanese:
      - 子供 {じゃ ある まい し}、食事 中 に スマホ を いじる の は やめ なさい。
      - 子供 {じゃ ある まい し}、食事 中 に スマホ は やめろ！
      - 子供 {じゃ ある まい し}、ご飯 の 時 は スマホ やめよう ね。
    english_literally: It is not as if you are a child, so stop fiddling with your smartphone during meals.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 子供 で も、食事 中 に スマホ を いじる の は やめ なさい。
        english: Even for a child, playing on a smartphone during meals should be stopped.
        hint: This uses 'でも' to generalize a rule. 'じゃあるまいし' specifically denies the listener's identity
          (as a child) to criticize their inappropriate behavior.
    scene: A grandmother scolding her teenage grandson for using his phone during dinner, expecting him
      to behave more appropriately.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: This is a classic use of 「じゃあるまいし」 to rebuke someone for childish behavior. The grandmother
      expresses clear disapproval and a direct command, implying that the grandson should know better
      at his age. The use of 「やめなさい」 is a common parental/grandparental command. The second variation
      uses 「やめろ！」 which is a stronger, masculine command typical of an older male to a younger male. The
      third variation 「やめようね」 is a softer, more inviting tone, common for a female speaker. The term 「スマホ
      を いじる」 means 'to fiddle with a smartphone,' emphasizing idle or distracting use.
    etymology: The verb 「いじる」 (to fiddle with, to toy with) implies handling something casually, often
      without a specific purpose or in an idle manner. When used with a smartphone during a meal, it conveys
      a sense of distraction or inappropriate engagement with the device.
  - english: This isn't a desert, so there's no way you can be that thirsty.
    japanese:
      - ここ は 砂漠 {じゃ ある まい し}、そんな に 喉 が 乾く はず が ない。
      - ここ は 砂漠 {じゃ ある まい し}、大げさ だ なあ。
      - ここ は 砂漠 {じゃ ある まい し}、そんな に 喉 乾か ない だろ。
    english_literally: It is not as if this is a desert, so there is no way your throat should be that
      dry.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ここ は 砂漠 で も ない から、そんな に 喉 が 乾く はず が ない。
        english: Because this isn't even a desert, there's no way you can be that thirsty.
        hint: This uses 'でもないから' to state a factual reason. 'じゃあるまいし' implies a stronger, almost exasperated,
          denial of the premise to critique the exaggeration.
    scene: A friend teasing another who is complaining excessively about being thirsty during a short
      walk in a well-watered park.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    nuance: Here, 「じゃあるまいし」 is used humorously to point out the exaggeration of the listener's complaint
      about thirst. It's a lighthearted way of saying 'don't be so dramatic' by denying the extreme condition
      (being in a desert) that would justify such thirst. The phrase 「はずがない」 reinforces the strong denial.
      「大げさ だなあ」 means 'how exaggerated,' adding to the humorous and slightly mocking tone. 「そんなに 喉 乾か
      ない だろ」 directly questions the extent of their thirst, reinforcing the mild teasing.
    etymology: The expression 「喉 が 乾く」 (のど が かわく, to be thirsty) literally means 'the throat dries.' This
      direct and physiological description of thirst is common in Japanese and serves as the basis for
      the exaggeration being critiqued.
  - english: It's not like you're the company president, so I don't think you need to meddle in the company's
      management that much.
    japanese:
      - 社長 {で ある わけ じゃ ある まい し}、そこ まで 会社 の 経営 に 口 を 出す 必要 は ない と 思い ます よ。
      - 社長 {じゃ ある まい し}、会社 の 経営 に そこ まで 関与 する 必要 は ない と 思い ます よ。
    english_literally: It is not as if you are the company president, so I think there is no need to put
      your mouth out about the company's management to that extent.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 社長 で も ない の に、そこ まで 会社 の 経営 に 口 を 出す 必要 は ない と 思い ます よ。
        english: Even though you're not the company president, I don't think you need to meddle in the
          company's management that much.
        hint: This uses 'のに' to express surprise or contradiction, but 'じゃあるまいし' specifically denies the
          listener's position to highlight that their actions are inappropriate or overstepping.
    scene: A male colleague gently advises a female colleague who is overstepping her boundaries by giving
      directives that are typically reserved for management.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: In a professional setting, 「じゃあるまいし」 can be used to politely but firmly remind someone of
      their position or limitations without being overtly rude. It implies that their actions are beyond
      their appropriate scope, gently advising them to stay in their lane. The 「と思いますよ」 softens the advice.
      The alternative 「関与 する」 (かんよする, to be involved in) is a more formal synonym for 「口 を 出す」 (くち を だす,
      to meddle, literally 'to put out one's mouth'), maintaining the semi-formal tone while offering
      slightly different phrasing.
    etymology: The idiom 「口 を 出す」 (くち を だす) literally means 'to put out one's mouth,' and it is used metaphorically
      to mean 'to interfere,' 'to meddle,' or 'to give unsolicited advice.' This imagery of projecting
      one's voice or opinion into a matter where it's not welcome or appropriate highlights the boundary-crossing
      nature of the action.
  - english: It's not like the exam was difficult, so why are you so worried about the results?
    japanese:
      - 試験 が 難しかっ た {わけ じゃ ある まい し}、なん で そんな に 結果 を 心配 し てる の？
      - 試験 が 難しかっ た {わけ じゃ ある まい し}、心配 する こと ない だろ。
      - 試験 が 難しかっ た {わけ じゃ ある まい し}、気楽 に 待とう よ。
    english_literally: It is not as if the exam was difficult, so why are you worrying about the results
      so much?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 試験 が 難しかっ た と し たら、そんな に 結果 を 心配 する の も 分かる けど。
        english: If the exam was difficult, I might understand why you're worrying about the results so
          much, but...
        hint: This uses a conditional to explore a hypothetical justification for the worry. 'じゃあるまいし'
          directly denies the premise, making the worry seem irrational.
    scene: A friend trying to comfort another who is overly anxious after taking an exam that was generally
      considered easy.
    register: casual
    setting: supportive
    nuance: This example uses 「わけじゃあるまいし」 with an い-adjective (難しかった) to point out the listener's unwarranted
      anxiety. It implies that their worry is disproportionate to the actual situation, as the exam was
      not difficult enough to justify such concern. The tone is comforting but also slightly questioning
      of the listener's overreaction. The phrase 「心配 する ことない だろ」 emphasizes there's 'nothing to worry
      about,' while 「気楽 に 待とうよ」 encourages waiting 'lightheartedly' or 'without stress.'
    etymology: 「気楽」 (きらく) combines 「気」 (き, spirit/feeling) and 「楽」 (らく, ease/comfort), literally meaning
      'easy feeling.' It describes a state of being carefree, relaxed, or unburdened, which is contrasted
      with the anxiety expressed by the listener in this example.
  - english: It's not like she's famous, so why is she trying to hide her face from everyone?
    japanese:
      - 彼女 は 有名 {な わけ じゃ ある まい し}、なん で みんな に 顔 を 隠そう と し てる の？
      - 彼女 は 有名 {な わけ じゃ ある まい し}、なん で そんな こと する の？
      - 彼女 は 有名 {な わけ じゃ ある まい し}、ちょっと 変 だ よ ね。
    english_literally: It is not as if she is famous, so why is she trying to hide her face from everyone?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 が 有名 な の だ と し たら、みんな に 顔 を 隠そう と する の も 分かる けど。
        english: If she were famous, I would understand why she's trying to hide her face from everyone,
          but...
        hint: This uses a conditional to suggest a scenario where the behavior would be understandable.
          'じゃあるまいし' firmly denies that scenario, making the behavior seem inexplicable.
    scene: Two friends observing a new acquaintance who is being overly shy or secretive, prompting one
      to question her behavior.
    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    nuance: Here, 「わけじゃあるまいし」 is used with a な-adjective (有名) to question the appropriateness of someone's
      behavior. It implies that the woman's actions (hiding her face) are excessive and illogical given
      that she lacks the fame that might necessitate such secrecy. The tone is one of mild bewilderment.
      The phrase 「ちょっと 変 だよね」 directly states she's 'a bit strange,' emphasizing the bewilderment.
    etymology: The verb 「隠す」 (かくす) means 'to hide' or 'to conceal.' When combined with 「顔 を 隠す」 (かお を
      かくす), it refers to hiding one's face, which can be done for various reasons, including modesty,
      shame, or, as in this context, an unwarranted sense of privacy or fame.
