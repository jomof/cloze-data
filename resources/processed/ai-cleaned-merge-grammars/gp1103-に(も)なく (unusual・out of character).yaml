        "usage-context": "This phrase often implies a sense of surprise or unexpectedness. It's used to describe deviations from the norm, whether in behavior, emotions, or environmental conditions. It can be applied to inanimate objects, situations, or a person's character/actions.",
        "nuance": "The optional inclusion of 「も」 intensifies the feeling of something being out of the ordinary, emphasizing the deviation from the expected state. While grammatically optional, 「も」 is frequently used for emphasis. The phrase highlights a notable contrast between a current state/action and the typical one, conveying a sense of mild astonishment or remarkability."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「に(も)なく」 combines 「に」 (a particle indicating state or condition or direction), 「も」 (an emphatic particle meaning 'even' or 'also'), and 「なく」 (the negative form of 「ある」, meaning 'to be/exist'). Syntactically, it implies 'not being in that usual state' or 'not existing in the expected manner for X (e.g., いつ, 柄, 我)'. Over time, this evolved to convey the meaning of 'unusually' or 'more than usual', pointing to a deviation from an established norm or character.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「に(も)なく」 is used to express that something is unusual or out of the ordinary, contrasting with the expected or typical state. It conveys a sense of surprise or unexpectedness regarding a situation, a person's mood, or a person's actions. The 「も」 particle, though optional, is very often included to add emphasis, highlighting the significant deviation from the norm. This expression is particularly effective when describing something that deviates from an established pattern or an individual's usual character or behavior. It is commonly used with nouns that indicate time, such as 「いつ」 (when/always) to form 「いつにもなく」, meaning 'more than usual' or 'unusually'. It also frequently combines with abstract nouns related to one's character or self, such as 「柄 (gara)」 (nature, character) to form 「柄にもなく」 (out of character), or 「我 (ga)」 (self, ego) to form 「我にもなく」 (involuntarily, unconsciously). These specific usages highlight actions or states that are surprising because they don't align with the subject's typical disposition or are performed without conscious intent. While 「に(も)なく」 can be used in various registers, it often appears in conversational or descriptive contexts where an observation of an unusual occurrence is being made. It's suitable for expressing personal observations and feelings of surprise.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When distinguishing 「に(も)なく」 from similar expressions, remember that 「に(も)なく」 emphasizes a deviation from the norm or an unusual state. For instance, while 「いつか」 talks about a future point in time, and 「いつものように」 describes routine, 「に(も)なく」 specifically highlights something being 'more than usual' or 'unlike' a typical situation or person. When describing an involuntary action, 「我にもなく」 conveys a stronger sense of losing conscious control than 「思わず」. Similarly, when describing an action that goes against someone's nature, 「柄にもなく」 focuses on the 'out-of-character' aspect, which is distinct from a simple contradiction expressed by 「～のに」. Furthermore, 「とても」 merely indicates a high degree and lacks the comparative, 'unusual' nuance of 「に(も)なく」.",
