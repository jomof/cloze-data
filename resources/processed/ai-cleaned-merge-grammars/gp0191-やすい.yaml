    "etymology": "The grammar point 「やすい」 originates from the classical Japanese adjective 「易し (やすし)」, meaning \"easy\" or \"simple.\" Over time, its form evolved into the modern い-adjective 「易い (やすい)」. When attached to the ます-stem of a verb, it compounds with the verb to create an adjectival phrase, indicating the ease with which an action can be performed or a natural tendency toward a state.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「やすい」 is an い-adjective that attaches to the ます-stem of a verb. It serves two primary functions:\n\n1.  **To express that something is easy to do.** In this sense, it describes the inherent ease of performing an action. For example, a pen that is easy to write with, or food that is easy to eat.\n2.  **To indicate that something is prone to happen or likely to occur.** This nuance is often used for tendencies, susceptibilities, or emotional responses. For instance, a person who is prone to crying easily, or a material that is likely to wrinkle.\n\nWhile the kanji 「易い」 exists, 「やすい」 is **most commonly written in hiragana**. It conjugates just like a regular い-adjective, allowing for various forms such as past tense (やすかった), negative (やすくない), and te-form (やすくて).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   Do not confuse 「やすい」 with 「安い (やすい)」, which means \"cheap\" or \"inexpensive.\" Although they share the same pronunciation, their kanji and meanings are entirely distinct.\n*   While 「やすい」 describes ease of action, if you wish to state that something is simply \"easy\" (as a general quality, not specifically linked to a verb), it is more natural to use the な-adjective 「簡単 (かんたん)」 (kantan) instead. For example, you would say 「簡単な問題」 (an easy problem), not 「易い問題」. 「やすい」 nearly always appears compounded with a verb.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When encountering words that sound similar, always consider the kanji and the context. 「やすい」, when used to mean 'easy to do' or 'prone to,' will typically be attached to a verb's ます-stem and is often written in hiragana or with the kanji 「易」. In contrast, 「安い」 (with the kanji 安) exclusively means 'cheap.' Furthermore, while 「簡単」 (kantan) conveys general 'easiness' for concepts or tasks, 「やすい」 is specifically about the 'ease of performing an action' directly linked to a verb. Pay attention to the subtle differences between 「がち」 and 「づらい」 as well. While 「がち」 expresses a general tendency (often negative), 「づらい」 highlights an internal difficulty or discomfort, setting them apart from the more neutral or positive implications of 「やすい」.",
