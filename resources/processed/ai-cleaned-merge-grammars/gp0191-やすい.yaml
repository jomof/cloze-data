    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「やすい」 originates from the classical Japanese adjective 「易し (やすし)」, meaning \"easy\" or \"simple.\" Over time, its form evolved into the modern い-adjective 「易い (やすい)」. When attached to the ます-stem of a verb, it compounds with the verb to create an adjectival phrase, indicating the ease with which an action can be performed or a natural tendency toward a state.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「やすい」 is an い-adjective that attaches to the ます-stem of a verb. It serves two primary functions:\n\n1.  **To express that something is easy to do.** In this sense, it describes the inherent ease of performing an action. For example, a pen that is easy to write with, or food that is easy to eat.\n2.  **To indicate that something is prone to happen or likely to occur.** This nuance is often used for tendencies, susceptibilities, or emotional responses. For instance, a person who is prone to crying easily, or a material that is likely to wrinkle.\n\nWhile the kanji 「易い」 exists, 「やすい」 is **most commonly written in hiragana**. It conjugates just like a regular い-adjective, allowing for various forms such as past tense (やすかった), negative (やすくない), and te-form (やすくて).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   Do not confuse 「やすい」 with 「安い (やすい)」, which means \"cheap\" or \"inexpensive.\" Although they share the same pronunciation, their kanji and meanings are entirely distinct.\n*   While 「やすい」 describes ease of action, if you wish to state that something is simply \"easy\" (as a general quality, not specifically linked to an action), it is more natural to use the な-adjective 「簡単 (かんたん)」 (kantan) instead of 「易い」 by itself. For example, you would say 「簡単な問題」 (an easy problem), not 「易い問題」. 「やすい」 nearly always appears compounded with a verb.",
