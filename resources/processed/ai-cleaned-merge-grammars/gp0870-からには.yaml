    "etymology": "The expression 「からには」 is derived from 「から」 (from), 「に」 (in/at), and 「は」 (topic marker). The combination signifies a starting point or a condition from which something follows logically or necessarily. It carries a nuance of commitment or consequence.",
    "writeup": "「からには」 is used to express a sense of obligation, commitment, or natural consequence that arises from a certain situation or decision. It often conveys the speaker's determination to fulfill what is expected or required, given the initial condition. It's similar to saying \"since I've come this far...\" or \"now that things are this way...\". It's a bit stronger than just 「から」, emphasizing the speaker's resolve. Be careful of 「からは」 which is more formal.",
