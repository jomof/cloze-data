jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: General
etymology: 「よう」 comes from 様(さま), meaning "state" or "appearance." Thus, 「ように」 and 「ような」 indicate something
  being in a certain "state" or "appearance," hence "like" or "similar to." Over time, its usage expanded
  to include purpose or goal, as achieving a goal means reaching a desired 'state' or 'manner'.
writeup: The grammar point 「ように・ような」 expresses similarity or likeness. 「ような」, often preceded by a noun
  (with の) or a plain form verb, modifies nouns to describe something as *being like* that noun or verb's
  state/action. 「ように」, also often preceded by a noun (with の) or a plain form verb, modifies verbs or
  adjectives adverbially to describe *how* something is done or its state. This form can also express
  uncertainty (similar to 'as if') or, crucially, a purpose or goal, indicating the desired state or manner
  of an action. Its versatility allows for direct comparisons, nuanced resemblances, and goal-oriented
  expressions.

      else, rather than an inference about its true nature. However, when 「ように」 expresses purpose, it
      indicates the manner to achieve a state, which is a distinct function.
    grammar_point: ようだ (it seems)
  - term: ように〜てほしい
    meaning: To want someone to do something in a certain way, to want someone to be able to do something,
      to want something to happen in a certain way.
    kind: similar expression

  - term: とおり
    meaning: In that way, Exactly, Precisely, Just as
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「とおり」 means "exactly as," indicating a precise, direct match or correspondence. 「ように」, while
      sometimes meaning "just as," more generally suggests similarity or a manner resembling something,
      allowing for slight variation rather than strict identity. When expressing purpose, 「ように」 refers
      to the *way* something is done to achieve a result, not an exact replication.
    grammar_point: とおり (exactly as)

  - term: 〜のごとく
    meaning: Like, As (literary)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: A highly literary and archaic expression, 「ごとし」 is not commonly used in modern spoken Japanese,

    grammar_point: 如く・如き・如し (classical comparison)
  - term: らしい (typical quality)
    meaning: Typical of, -ish, like, appropriate for

      indicating something *is like* something else without necessarily implying it's a defining characteristic.
    grammar_point: '[Noun]らしい (typical of・-like)'
post_false_friends_writeup: While many expressions can convey similarity in Japanese, it is crucial to
  distinguish their nuances. 「ように・ような」 generally indicates a more direct and perhaps closer comparison
  than options like 「みたい」 or 「ふうに」. Expressions such as 「そう」 indicate an immediate sensory impression
  or likelihood, whereas 「ように・ような」 can be based on a more considered assessment or an inherent quality.
  Furthermore, 「ように」 uniquely carries the additional function of expressing purpose or goal, indicating
  the desired state or manner of an action, further expanding its utility in Japanese communication.

  for appearances, actions, or abstract qualities. Notice how 「よう な」 directly modifies nouns, while 「よう
  に」 acts as an adverbial phrase, modifying verbs or adjectives. This distinction is crucial for correct
  usage. Additionally, 「ように」 frequently serves to express purpose or goal, indicating the desired state
  or manner of an action, further expanding its utility in Japanese communication.
