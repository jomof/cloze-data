        "usage-context": "Used to express a perspective from which a statement or judgment is made.",
        "nuance": "This phrase often implies a comprehensive or systematic viewpoint, providing the basis for a rational evaluation, conclusion, or opinion. It is not used to refer to a person's direct opinion or physical observation; for that, expressions like 「～にしたら」 or 「～から見ると」 are more appropriate. When referring to a person's perspective, the phrase 「～の立場から言うと」 (from [person]'s standpoint) should be used instead of 「Personから言うと」. Additionally, 「から言うと」 is generally unsuitable for momentary or purely visual assessments, as it highlights an 'overall situation' or 'systematic' perspective. For visual assessments, 「から見ると」 is typically preferred. The variations 「から言えば」 and 「から言って」 convey similar meanings, with 「から言えば」 sometimes carrying a slightly more conditional nuance and 「から言って」 often used when judging from results or a specific piece of evidence. "
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「から言うと」 is formed from three core components: the particle 「から」 (kara), meaning 'from' or 'since'; the verb 「言う」 (iu), meaning 'to say' or 'to speak'; and the particle 「と」 (to), which can indicate a conditional relationship or an assumed consequence. Literally, it translates to 'speaking from' or 'if one speaks from'. This structure establishes the basis or origin of the perspective from which an opinion, evaluation, or conclusion is presented. The inclusion of the verb 「言う」 directly points to the act of verbalizing a viewpoint, making the expression explicit about the source of the judgment.",
    "writeup": "「から言うと」 is a Japanese phrase used to express a particular viewpoint or standpoint from which an evaluation, conclusion, or opinion is drawn. It can also appear in its conjugated forms as 「から言えば」 or 「から言って」, which convey very similar meanings.\n\nThis grammatical structure always follows a noun or noun phrase, indicating the domain or perspective that serves as the foundation for the subsequent statement. It functions much like English phrases such as 'speaking in terms of (A), (B)', 'from the point of view of (A), (B)', or 'what can be concluded from (A) is that (B)'.\n\n**Important Considerations for Usage:**\n\n*   **Perspective of a Person:** You cannot directly use 「Name + から言うと」 to express a person's opinion (e.g., 「タクミから言うと」 is unnatural). Instead, you must specify the person's 'standpoint' or 'position' using 「Name の立場から言うと」 or 「Name の視点から言うと」. This highlights that the evaluation comes from their specific role or perspective, not just from the person themselves.\n*   **Suitability for Contexts:** 「から言うと」 is best suited for expressing analytical or systematic viewpoints that stem from a broad situation, concept, or set of data. It is **not** typically used for momentary observations or purely visual assessments. For example, if you are judging something based solely on its appearance, 「から見ると」 would be a more natural and appropriate choice. While using 「から言うと」 for such cases might not be strictly incorrect, it can sound unnatural to a native speaker.",

            "nuance": "「で言うと」 is typically used to introduce a specific topic or category for discussion, often for definition or specification. For example, 「日本語で言うと…」 (In Japanese, it's...). In contrast, 「から言うと」 focuses on the specific perspective or criteria used for a judgment or evaluation of a situation or fact, rather than just introducing a topic for general discussion.

While it indicates a perspective, it often implies a fixed, established rule or principle. 「から言うと」 is more broadly applicable to various viewpoints, including those derived from experience, results, or general situations, not necessarily formal rules, and focuses on the act of articulating a judgment from that perspective.
