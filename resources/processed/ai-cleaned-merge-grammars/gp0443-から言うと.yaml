    "etymology": "This grammar point consists of 「から」 (from), 「言う」 (to say), and 「と」 (a particle indicating a conditional or assumption). Etymologically, it signifies 'speaking from' a certain perspective or basis.",
    "writeup": "「から言うと」 (appearing with or without kanji) is a phrase in Japanese used to express a particular viewpoint or standpoint from which an evaluation, conclusion, or opinion can be drawn. The 「と」 that appears here is one of the assumption uses of this particle, meaning that 「から言えば」 may also be used.\n\n「からいうと」 will always follow a noun (or noun phrase), before the (B) part of that same sentence will describe some kind of evaluation/opinion/etc. This structure closely reflects phrases like \"speaking in terms of (A), (B)\", or \"what can be drawn from (A) is that (B)\".\n\nOccasionally, the use of particles such as 「と」 or 「ば」 may be skipped entirely, with 「から言って」 being used instead.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   While \"Name + からいうと\" may sound unnatural, using something like \"name の立場からいうと\" is acceptable, as it highlights a specific situation that the person is in.\n*   Because 「からいうと」 regularly highlights some sort of 'overall situation', it will not be used with momentary/visual things. In these cases, while not strictly incorrect, it may sound quite unnatural to a native speaker. A more appropriate choice here would be something like 「から見ると」, as this can be used to make purely visual assessments.",
