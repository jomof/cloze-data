    "etymology": "「から」 indicates origin or starting point. 「言う」 is the verb \"to say.\" 「と」, in this context, functions as a particle indicating a conditional or suppositional statement. Therefore, 「から言うと」 literally translates to \"if one speaks from [a certain perspective].\"",
    "writeup": "「から言うと」 (with or without kanji) expresses a viewpoint from which an evaluation, conclusion, or opinion is drawn. The 「と」 here indicates assumption, similar to 「言えば」. 「から言うと」 follows a noun (or noun phrase), with the subsequent part of the sentence describing an evaluation, opinion, etc. This structure is similar to \"speaking in terms of (A), (B)\" or \"what can be drawn from (A) is that (B).\" Particles like 「と」 or 「ば」 can sometimes be omitted, resulting in 「から言って」.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   Do not use 「Name+からいうと」 because a person is not a situation. Instead, use 「name の立場からいうと」 to highlight their specific situation.\n*   「から言うと」 emphasizes an overall situation and is less suitable for momentary or visual things. 「から見ると」 is more appropriate for visual assessments.",
