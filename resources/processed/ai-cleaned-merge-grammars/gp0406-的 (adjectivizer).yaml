  part-of-speech: suffix
  register: formal
  usage-context: General use, applicable to various situations.
  function: To transform a noun into an adjectival or adverbial phrase, indicating a characteristic, nature,
    or perspective related to the noun.
  nuance: Implies that something is characteristic of, pertaining to, or viewed from the standpoint of
    the preceding noun. It can denote objectivity or a strong connection.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a quasi-adjective or quasi-adverb, adding specificity to nouns or verbs
etymology: The kanji 的 (teki) originally means "target" or "mark." In this grammatical context, it shifts
  to indicate something is "-like" or "-al" in relation to the noun it modifies. It suggests that something
  pertains to or characterizes that noun.
writeup: |-
  的 (teki) is a suffix that attaches to nouns, transforming them into な-adjectives or adverbs. It has two primary functions.

  The first use is akin to expressing something "considering" or "within the category of" the preceding noun, often translated as '~ly', '~like', or '~al'. When modifying a noun, 的 is followed by **な** (making it a な-adjective). For example, **科学的** (kagaku-teki) means 'scientific', as in something relating to science. When modifying a verb, it is followed by **に** (making it an adverb), describing the manner in which an action is performed, such as **個人的に** (kojin-teki ni) meaning 'personally'.

  The second common use of 的 is specifically with people's names. It highlights that an action or characteristic is precisely what one would expect from that particular person, serving to describe something as typical of them. This can be used in both positive and negative contexts, implying "that's so [person's name]" or "just what you'd expect of [person's name]".

  **Note on Nuance:** To grasp the unique essence of 的, it is useful to compare it with another common suffix, 圏 (ken).

  *   **圏 (ken)** implies something occurring literally within the sphere or domain of the preceding noun. For example, **英語圏** (eigo-ken) means the "English-speaking world" – a physical or linguistic domain.
  *   **的 (teki)**, on the other hand, conveys something being true or applicable *from the perspective* or *standpoint* of the preceding noun. It indicates that a statement or description holds true when viewed through the lens of that noun.

  Thus, when you wish to convey a statement valid from a particular standpoint or a characteristic typical of something, 的 is the precise choice.
false_friends:
  - term: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems・I hear)'
    meaning: Seems like, Apparently, I heard
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 的, らしい often conveys secondhand information or speculation about someone's characteristic
      behavior or typical state, rather than defining a direct characteristic of a noun itself.
    grammar_point: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems・I hear)'
  - term: っぽい (ish; characteristic of)
    meaning: -ish, -like, Characteristic of, Tendency to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: っぽい suggests a resemblance or tendency, often with a slightly negative or informal connotation,
      implying something is 'sort of' or 'kind of' like the noun, but less formal or objective than 的.
    grammar_point: っぽい (ish; characteristic of)
  - term: ぎみ (slight tendency or feeling)
    meaning: Looking, Feeling a little, Touch of, Tending to, Slightly
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: ぎみ indicates a slight tendency or inclination towards something, often a negative physical
      or emotional state. It cannot be used to create general '-ly', '-like', or '-al' words from nouns,
      unlike 的.
    grammar_point: ぎみ (slight tendency or feeling)
post_false_friends_writeup: While らしい, っぽい, and ぎみ share some overlap in meaning with 的, it's important
  to note their distinct nuances and usage. 的 is more versatile in creating adjectives and adverbs that
  express "-ly", "-like", or "-al", often with an objective or defining quality. The others have more
  specific implications regarding appearance, tendency, or partial states.
examples:
  - english: This is my personal opinion.
    japanese:
      - これ は 私 の 個人 {的} な 意見 です。
      - これ は 私 の 個人 {的} な 意見 だ。
      - これ は 私 の 個人 {的} な 意見 だ ぜ。
    english_literally: This, as for my personal opinion, it is.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ は 私 {の} 意見 です。
        english: This is my opinion.
        hint: 「これは 私の 意見 です」 is too blunt and lacks the nuance of subjectivity. We're looking for an opinion
          that is personal, rather than an objective or officially sanctioned, opinion.
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ は 私 の プライベート {な} 意見 です。
        english: This is my private opinion.
        hint: 「プライベートな」 implies something private or secret. We're looking for an opinion that is personal,
          not necessarily confidential.
    scene: A colleague is offering a suggestion during a team meeting but wants to make it clear that
      it's their own viewpoint, not an official company stance.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「個人的な」 emphasizes that the opinion is subjective and specific to the speaker, distinguishing
      it from a general or objective truth
  - english: Please explain a bit more concretely.
    japanese:
      - もう 少し 具体 {的} に 説明 し て ください。
      - もう 少し 具体 {的} に 説明 し て いただけ ます か。
      - もう 少し 具体 {的} に 説明 し て くれ。

    english_literally: More a little concretely please explain.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - もう 少し 詳し {く} 説明 し て ください。
        english: Please explain a bit more in detail.
        hint: While 「詳しく」 means 'in detail', 「具体的に」 emphasizes 'concrete' or 'specific examples'. We're
          looking for a request for specific examples.
    scene: A manager is asking an employee to provide more specific details and examples in their presentation,
      as the current explanation is too vague.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「具体的に」 specifies the manner of explanation, indicating that the person responds based on emotion
      rather than logic. This is commonly used in professional and academic settings to ask for clarity

    japanese:
      - その 歴史 {的} な 建造 物 は 大変 価値 が あり ます。

      - その 歴史 {的} な 建造 物 は とても 価値 が あり ます。
    english_literally: That historical building is very valuable.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その {古い} 建造 物 は 大変 価値 が あり ます。
        english: That old building is very valuable.
        hint: 「古い」 simply means 'old' and doesn't convey historical significance. We're looking for a
          word that emphasizes its historical importance, not just its age.
    scene: A tour guide is explaining the significance of an old, architecturally important structure
      to a group of tourists, highlighting its cultural and historical value.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「歴史的な」 emphasizes the building's importance and connection to history, not merely its age.
      This phrasing is typical in discussions about cultural heritage
  - english: Is this interesting from Yamada's perspective?
    japanese:
      - これ は 山田 {的} に は 面白い の か な？

          - 山田 さん は これ を 面白い {と 思う} か な？
        english: Will Yamada find this interesting, I wonder?
        hint: 「山田さんはこれを面白いと思うかな？」 is grammatically correct but sounds more like a direct question about
          Yamada's thought process. We're looking for a casual way to ask 'from Yamada's point of view'.
    scene: Two friends are discussing a gift for their mutual friend Yamada, trying to guess what he would
      like based on his known preferences and personality.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「山田的には」 implies looking at something through Yamada's particular taste or viewpoint, as in
      'typical of Yamada.' The casual question ending 「〜かな？」 indicates speculation, common in relaxed
      conversations
  - english: It's a problem because he always reacts emotionally.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は いつ も 感情 {的} に 反応 する から 困る。

          - 彼 は いつ も 気持ち {で} 反応 する から 困る。
        english: It's a problem because he always reacts with his feelings.
        hint: 「気持ちで反応する」 literally means 'react with feelings,' but 「感情的に反応する」 is the natural and common
          expression for 'reacting emotionally' in Japanese. We're looking for the most natural way to
          say 'reacts emotionally'.
    scene: A friend is complaining to another about a mutual acquaintance who often reacts to situations
      based on strong feelings rather than logic or calm consideration, causing difficulties.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: 「感情的に」 describes the manner of reaction, indicating that the person responds based on emotion
      rather than logic. The phrase 「〜から困る」 signifies that this behavior causes trouble or annoyance for
      the speaker
  - english: This is a typical example.
    japanese:
      - これ は 典型 {的} な 例 です。
      - これ は 典型 {的} な 例 だ。
      - これ は 典型 {的} な 例 な ん です。

          - これ は {よく} ある 例 です。
        english: This is a common example.
        hint: While 「よくある」 means 'common' or 'frequent,' 「典型的な」 specifically denotes 'typical' or 'representative,'
          highlighting the archetypal nature of the example. We're looking for a word that emphasizes
          its representativeness.
    scene: A teacher is explaining a concept to students and presents an example that perfectly illustrates
      the concept.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: 「典型的な」 indicates that the example perfectly embodies or represents the characteristics of
      its category, making it a definitive illustration
  - english: We should consider it scientifically.
    japanese:
      - 科学 {的} に 考える べき だ。

          - 理科 {の} 視点 で 考える べき だ。
        english: We should consider it from a science viewpoint.
        hint: 「理科の視点」 refers to the viewpoint of a specific school subject (science class), whereas 「科学的に」
          refers to a general scientific methodology or approach. We're looking for an adverbial phrase
          that means 'in a scientific manner'.
    scene: A group of researchers are discussing a problem and one suggests approaching it with a rigorous,
      evidence-based methodology.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: academic

      - competing_japanese:
          - それ は とても 日本 {の} 考え 方 だ。
        english: That's a very Japanese way of thinking (of the country).
        hint: 「日本の考え方」 simply refers to a Japanese way of thinking as originating from the country, but
          「日本人的な」 specifically characterizes it as typical or inherent to the Japanese people. We're looking
          for a phrasing that highlights a characteristic of the people.
    scene: Two people from different cultural backgrounds are discussing cultural differences, and one
      points out a common thought process prevalent in Japan.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「日本人的な」 describes a characteristic or way of thinking that is typical of Japanese people,
      often highlighting a cultural trait. It is a more direct and defining statement than simply 'from
      Japan'
  - english: I want to act ethically.
    japanese:
      - 道徳 {的} に 行動 し たい。
      - 道徳 {的} に 行動 し たい です。
      - 道徳 {的} に 行動 し たい と 思う。
    english_literally: Ethically to act want.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:

    scene: An individual is reflecting on their personal values and aspirations, deciding to prioritize
      moral principles in their actions.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「道徳的に」 specifies the manner of action, emphasizing adherence to moral and ethical principles
      rather than just following rules or doing what is 'correct'
  - english: From Tanaka's perspective, this isn't acceptable.
    japanese:
      - 田中 {的} に は、これ は 許せ ない。
      - 田中 {的} に は、これ は 許せ ない だろう。
      - 田中 {的} に は、これ は 許せ ない よ。
    english_literally: Tanaka-wise, this is not forgivable.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 田中 さん は これ を 許さ ない {だろう}。
        english: Tanaka probably won't forgive this.
        hint: 「田中さんはこれを許さないだろう」 is a prediction of Tanaka's action. 「田中的には」 expresses something from Tanaka's
          point of view or judgment, making it a more direct statement about his internal stance. We're
          looking for a phrase that expresses Tanaka's personal perspective on something.
    scene: Two colleagues are discussing a decision that has been made, and one comments on how a third
      colleague, Tanaka, would likely react based on his known character.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 「田中的には」 conveys that the statement reflects Tanaka's personal viewpoint or typical reaction,
      often implying that this perspective is characteristic of him. The casualness is reinforced by the
      lack of honorifics for Tanaka.
post_example_writeup: The nuance of 的 can vary based on the context. Sometimes it implies objectivity
  or distance, while other times it expresses a strong connection or inherent quality.
