id: gp0406
meaning: suffix for forming adjectives from nouns; -al, -ic, -ive, -ly, -ous
pronunciation:
  katakana: テキ
  romaji: teki
formation:
  Noun + 的: Forms a な-adjective expressing a characteristic related to the noun.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The character 的 (teki) originally referred to a 'target' or 'mark'. Over time, its usage evolved
  in Chinese and then Japanese to denote 'pertaining to' or 'having the nature of', similar to suffixes
  like '-ic' or '-al' in English. This semantic shift from a concrete target to an abstract characteristic
  reflects how linguistic elements can extend their meaning.
writeup: The suffix 的 (teki) is a common and highly productive suffix in Japanese used to create な-adjectives
  from nouns. It attaches directly to a noun to form a new adjective that describes something as 'related
  to', 'characteristic of', or 'in the nature of' that noun. For instance, 文化 (culture) becomes 文化的 (cultural),
  and 科学 (science) becomes 科学的 (scientific). Using 的 often lends a more formal, academic, or objective
  tone to the expression compared to other ways of describing nouns. While the base form is Noun+的, when
  used to modify a noun, it typically appears as Noun+的な. When used as an adverb, it becomes Noun+的に.
  It is crucial to understand these variations to use 的 correctly.

  - term: 的な
    meaning: adjectival form of words ending in 的
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 的 alone forms the base, 적인 is the actual な-adjective form used when directly modifying
      a noun. For example, 歴史的 (historical) is the stem, but you would say 歴史的な出来事 (a historical event).
    grammar_point: な-Adjective (modifying nouns)
  - term: 的に
    meaning: adverbial form of words ending in 的
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 的に functions as an adverb, modifying verbs or adjectives. For example, 歴史的 (historical) when
      used as an adverb becomes 歴史的に見て (historically speaking) or 歴史的に正しい (historically correct).
    grammar_point: な-Adjective[に] (adverbial form)
  - term: 〜風
    meaning: style・manner
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜風 (fū) also forms adjectives but specifically denotes 'style,' 'manner,' or 'like a particular
      thing,' often with a slightly more casual or evocative nuance than 的. For example, 日本風 (Japanese
      style) vs. 日本的 (characteristic of Japan).
    grammar_point: 風 (style・manner)
  - term: 〜っぽい
    meaning: ish; characteristic of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜っぽい (ppoi) indicates that something 'looks like' or 'tends to be' something, often with a
      slight negative or informal connotation, unlike the more neutral and formal 的. For example, 子供っぽい
      (childish) vs. 子供的 (child-like, in a more descriptive sense).
    grammar_point: っぽい (ish; characteristic of)
post_false_friends_writeup: The key distinction between 的, 적인, and 的に lies in their grammatical function.
  的 is the core suffix. 적인 is the proper な-adjective form used before a noun. 的に is the adverbial form
  used to modify verbs or other adjectives. While other suffixes like 〜風 or 〜っぽい can also form adjectives,
  they carry different nuances regarding formality, tone, and the specific nature of the characteristic
  being described.

      - competing_japanese:
          - これ は 歴史 の 建物 です。
        english: This is a building of history.
        hint: Using の here would imply the building belongs to or is associated with history, rather than
          describing its inherent historical nature. We're looking for an adjective.

          describing the quality of her thinking.
    scene: Two colleagues discuss a third person.
    register: casual
    setting: professional
    nuance: The use of 「論理的」highlights the analytical and reasoned nature of her thought process, a common

        hint: 完全に (kanzen ni) means 'completely' and modifies the truth. 「絶対的」describes the *nature* of

          describing truth.

post_example_writeup: As you can see from these examples, 的 is broadly applicable across various contexts,
  from describing physical objects to abstract concepts and personal traits. It consistently adds the
  nuance of 'related to' or 'characteristic of' the preceding noun, helping to form precise and often
  formal descriptions.
