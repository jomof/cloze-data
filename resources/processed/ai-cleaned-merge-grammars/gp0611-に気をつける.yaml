        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "general",
        "function": "expresses caution, warning, or careful consideration towards something",
        "nuance": "Implies personal vigilance and active effort to avoid undesirable outcomes or to maintain focus.",
        "source": "Bunpro"
    },
    "etymology": "The expression 「気をつける」 combines the noun 「気(き)」, meaning \"spirit\" or \"attention,\" with the particle 「を」, and the Ichidan verb 「付ける(つける)」, meaning \"to attach\" or \"to apply.\" Thus, 「気をつける」 literally translates to \"to attach one's attention (to something).\" The particle 「に」 in 「に気をつける」 indicates the object or area to which one's attention or care is directed.",
    "writeup": "「に気をつける」 is a fundamental expression used to convey the need for caution, attention, or vigilance regarding a specific noun or situation. It emphasizes a conscious effort to prevent something undesirable from happening or to ensure something desirable is achieved. This grammar point is versatile and can be used in various contexts, from giving a direct warning to expressing one's own careful intentions.\n\nWhile 「に気をつける」 can be used independently to mean \"to be careful of X,\" it is very frequently paired with the 「ないように」 construction (e.g., 「～ないように気をつける」). This combination explicitly states the negative outcome one is trying to avoid by being careful. For instance, 「風邪を引かないように気をつける」 means \"to be careful not to catch a cold.\"\n\nIt is often used when offering advice or warning others, or when describing one's own resolve to act cautiously. The particle 「に」 directly precedes the noun or noun-like phrase that requires attention.",
