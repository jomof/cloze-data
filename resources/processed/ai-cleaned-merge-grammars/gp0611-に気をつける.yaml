    "etymology": "The expression 「気をつける」 combines the noun 「気(き)」, meaning \"spirit\" or \"attention,\" with the particle 「を」, and the Ichidan verb 「付ける(つける)」, meaning \"to attach\" or \"to apply.\" Thus, 「気をつける」 literally translates to \"to attach one's attention (to something).\" The particle 「に」 in 「に気をつける」 indicates the object or area to which one's attention or care is directed.",
    "writeup": "「に気をつける」 is a fundamental expression used to convey the need for caution, attention, or vigilance regarding a specific noun or situation. It emphasizes a conscious effort to prevent something undesirable from happening or to ensure something desirable is achieved. This grammar point is versatile and can be used in various contexts, from giving a direct warning to expressing one's own careful intentions.\n\nWhile 「に気をつける」 can be used independently to mean \"to be careful of X,\" it is very frequently paired with the 「ないように」 construction (e.g., 「～ないように気をつける」). This combination explicitly states the negative outcome one is trying to avoid by being careful. For instance, 「風邪を引かないように気をつける」 means \"to be careful not to catch a cold.\"\n\nIt is often used when offering advice or warning others, or when describing one's own resolve to act cautiously. The particle 「に」 directly precedes the noun or noun-like phrase that requires attention.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While both imply being careful, 「注意する」 often carries a nuance of formal warning or objective caution (e.g., traffic signs use 「注意」), or a general observation. 「に気をつける」 focuses more on the *personal, active* vigilance or mindfulness one exerts."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「用心する」 implies a stronger sense of active precaution or being on guard against potential danger or trouble. It suggests preparing for or preventing something specific, whereas 「に気をつける」 can be about more general attentiveness or carefulness without an immediate threat."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "Though 「に気をつける」, 「注意する」, and 「用心する」 can all translate to 'to be careful,' their nuances differ significantly. 「に気をつける」 emphasizes individual vigilance and self-awareness in one's actions or regarding a specific object. 「注意する」 is broader, often used for warnings or general attentiveness, such as a notice about wet floors. 「用心する」 suggests a higher level of preparedness against a perceived threat, like taking precautions before entering a risky situation. Choose 「に気をつける」 when the focus is on a person's mindful behavior or specific attention to detail.",
