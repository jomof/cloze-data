grammar_point: '[Verb-(ら)れる]ままに (as one is told)'
learn_before:
  - ままに (as desired)
id: gp0926
meaning: As one is told or instructed; passively following orders or influence
pronunciation:
  katakana: ママニ
  romaji: mamani
formation:
  Verb[passive form] + ままに: Indicates performing an action exactly as instructed or influenced, without
    personal will.
jlpt: N1
etymology: The construction combines the passive form of a verb (～られる) with まま and the particle に. ～られる
  (passive) indicates that the subject receives an action. まま (as is, unchanged) suggests doing something
  exactly in the state or manner given. に is a particle indicating manner or state. Therefore, it literally
  means "to be in the state of being acted upon and then doing as that state dictates." This emphasizes
  the lack of independent will and simply following what is received.
writeup: Verb[passive form] + ままに is a grammatical pattern used to describe an action that is performed
  exactly as one is told, instructed, or influenced, without much personal will or initiative. It highlights
  the passive nature of the subject's action, indicating that they are merely following external directives.
  This expression often carries a nuance of obedience, resignation, or sometimes a lack of critical thought
  in executing an action. It is more formal and literary than simpler expressions like 言われた通りに (iwareru
  toori ni – as told). It implies a complete and unhesitating adherence to the received instruction or
  influence, almost as if the person is an instrument.

  - term: 〜通りに (toori ni)
    meaning: as; according to; exactly as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜通りに is a more general expression for following something exactly as it is, whether it is
      instructions, a pattern, or a plan. It does not inherently carry the passive implication of being
      "told" as strongly as [Verb-(ら)れる]ままに. It is neutral regarding the subject's will.
    grammar_point: とおり (exactly as)
  - term: 〜に従って (ni shitagatte)
    meaning: following; in accordance with; obeying
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 〜に従って implies adherence to rules, orders, or a process, often with a sense of formality or
      compliance. While it involves following instructions, it suggests a more active decision to comply,
      rather than the complete lack of personal will implied by [Verb-(ら)れる]ままに. It focuses on conformity
      to a standard or system.
    grammar_point: したがって (therefore)
  - term: 〜ように (youni)
    meaning: as; in such a way that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: When used to mean "as" (e.g., 「私が言ったようにしてください」 "Please do as I said"), 〜ように is a general way
      to express doing something in a certain manner or according to a suggestion. It lacks the strong
      emphasis on being passively acted upon that [Verb-(ら)れる]ままに conveys. It is more about conformity
      to a method or advice.
    grammar_point: ように (purpose or desired state)
post_false_friends_writeup: While [Verb-(ら)れる]ままに, 〜通りに, 〜に従って, and 〜ように can all describe actions performed
  based on external factors, their nuances differ significantly. [Verb-(ら)れる]ままに emphasizes the passive
  reception of an instruction and the subsequent action, almost suggesting a lack of independent thought
  or a resigned obedience. In contrast, 〜通りに is a neutral expression for simply doing something exactly
  as specified. 〜に従って implies active compliance with rules or guidelines, often in a formal context. 〜ように,
  when used similarly, generally indicates following advice or performing an action in a specified manner,
  without the strong implication of being coerced or completely yielding one's will.

post_example_writeup: As illustrated by the examples, Verb[passive form] + ままに is versatile, applying
  to various contexts from simple obedience to philosophical surrender to fate. Its core meaning consistently
  revolves around acting in a completely receptive manner, allowing external forces or instructions to
  dictate one's actions.
