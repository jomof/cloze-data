        "[Verb in た-form] + なり (で)": "Indicates that an action or state continues without change after the initial verb.",

        "part-of-speech": "conjunction",
        "register": "formal",
        "nuance": "This pattern often implies that the continuation of the state or action is unexpected, undesirable, or simply a persistent result of the initial action, often suggesting neglect or lack of follow-up. It can also describe simply maintaining a physical posture. The use of (で) after なり is optional but can sometimes emphasize the persistent state. The less common なりの + [Noun] pattern describes a noun that is left in or maintains the state of the preceding verb's action, e.g., 「座ったなりの姿勢」 (a seated posture that is maintained)."
    },
    "etymology": "The なり in this construction is thought to derive from the noun 形 (katachi), meaning 'shape' or 'form'. This etymology highlights the idea that something remains in the same 'shape' or state as when the initial action occurred, emphasizing an unchanging or persistent condition.",
    "writeup": "The construction 「～たなり」, used after the past-tense (た-form) of a verb, indicates that a particular state or action persists uninterruptedly from the moment the initial verb's action was completed. It carries a nuance similar to 「～まま」, but often implies a more abrupt or unexpected continuation, frequently with an underlying sense of neglect, abandonment, or an undesirable persistence.\n\nThis pattern describes a direct consequence of an action that continues without change. For instance, if someone 'left (出た) and never returned', the 'never returning' is a continuous state directly stemming from the 'leaving'. While it can describe simple continuation, it frequently carries a negative or lamentable implication, suggesting that things have been left as they are, often to a detrimental effect.\n\nWhen 「～たなり」 is used to describe a physical posture or state, it highlights the maintenance of that position or condition after an action has been performed. For example, 「座ったなり」 describes someone remaining seated or staying in a seated posture.\n\nIt is important to distinguish this 「なり」 from the classic copula 「なり」 or the 「～なり～なり」 meaning 'either A or B'. This 「なり」 specifically functions as a conjunction, connecting the initial action to its persistent aftermath. The optional inclusion of 「で」 after 「なり」 can sometimes add emphasis to the continuous state.",

            "speaker_age": "older",
            "nuance": "The phrase 「連絡 が ない」 (no contact) indicates a lack of communication. The use of 「～たなり」 emphasizes the continuous absence of contact directly following the action of leaving home, implying a worrying and uninterrupted state of silence. The phrase 「一言 も」 (not a single word) intensifies the concern, making the lack of contact absolute. This reflects a mother's deep worry for her child, common for older female speakers in casual settings speaking to friends. "

            "setting": "informative",
            "nuance": "The structure 「走り出したなり」 highlights the immediate and uninterrupted nature of her actions after she began running. The continuous state of 'not looking back' is directly tied to the onset of running, suggesting a determined escape. This conveys a sense of rapid, decisive action from a formal perspective, typical for police reports.",
            "etymology": "「走り出す」 (hashiridasu) combines 走る (hashiru, to run) and 出す (dasu, to begin), meaning 'to start running'. The auxiliary verb-like use of '出す' for inception is common in Japanese. "

            "nuance": "「買ったなり」 indicates that the state of being unread (読まずに置いてある) has persisted continuously since the act of buying. It implies a sense of neglect or procrastination, a common sentiment among younger students. The use of 「たくさんある」 (there are many) emphasizes the scale of the unread books, highlighting the speaker's habit. The casual tone and topic are typical for a male student among peers. "

This use of 「～たなり」 emphasizes the unchanging, persistent nature of his silence, suggesting deep thought or defiance. The formality of the setting and the deliberate silence fit the serious tone of an interrogation.",
            "etymology": "「腰かける」 (koshikakeru) means 'to sit down' or 'take a seat'. It is often used for a more temporary sitting than 「座る」 (suwaru)."

The use of 「一度 も」 (not even once) emphasizes the absolute lack of return, typical for informal conversation between friends discussing someone's life changes. This kind of observation is common among younger female speakers.",

It implies a profound and continuous emotional shift. The phrase 「以前のように笑うことがなくなった」 (stopped laughing like before) highlights the drastic and enduring change in his personality. This reflective, melancholic tone is often conveyed by younger speakers contemplating serious historical impacts, such as war, on older family members."

For example, 「開けっ放しのまま」 (left wide open) focuses on the state itself, whereas 「開けたなり」 (left open after opening it) stresses the action leading to the state and its persistence. "

            "nuance": "「～きり」 typically emphasizes exclusivity ('only' or 'just') or a definitive end to an action, after which something ceases. When used in a temporal sense, like 「～てきり」, it emphasizes that an action occurred *once* and has not been repeated since. For example, 「一度会ったきり」 (met only once). In contrast, 「～たなり」 emphasizes the *continuation of a state* that resulted from the action, rather than the action itself being singular or the last. It's about what persists, not what stopped or was limited to a single occurrence. "

            "nuance": "「以来」 is a more general term indicating 'since' a particular point in time or event. It simply marks the starting point of a period. 「～たなり」, however, specifically highlights that a state or action has *persisted without change* from that point forward, often with the implication of neglect or an undesirable outcome. For instance, 「卒業以来連絡がない」 (no contact since graduation) is general, while 「卒業したなり連絡がない」 (no contact ever since graduating) emphasizes the continued lack of contact as a direct and uninterrupted result of graduating."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「まま」, 「きり」, and 「以来」 can sometimes appear in contexts similar to 「～たなり」, each carries a distinct nuance. 「まま」 broadly describes something remaining as it is. 「きり」 emphasizes a singular occurrence or a cessation of action from a certain point. 「以来」 simply marks a temporal starting point for a period. In contrast, 「～たなり」 specifically conveys that a state or action has persisted without interruption since a prior event, often with a subtle implication of neglect or an unintended, continuous consequence.
