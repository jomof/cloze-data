    "etymology": "The なり comes from the noun 形 (katachi), meaning \"shape\" or \"form.\" It implies that something remains in the same form or state as when the initial action occurred.",
    "writeup": "When following the た (past-tense) form of a verb, the construction 「～たなり」 indicates something existing in an ongoing state, similar to 「まま」. This can be translated as \"while (A)\" or \"remaining (A).\" Because 「～たなり」 sentences usually describe something happening while in the state of (A), they are often followed directly by a comma or by the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb 「だ」, 「で」. After this, the (B) phrase then describes what is happening during (A). 「～たなり」 is primarily used to express an undesirable state continuing despite (A) having happened, although this is not a strict rule. Because 「～たなり」 indicates that (A) is something that continues to stay in the same state, it often carries the nuance of \"ever since (A)\" in situations where a significant amount of time has passed.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   This 「なり」 derives from the noun 「形」 (\"shape\") and is different from the 「なり」 that is used as the classic copula.",
