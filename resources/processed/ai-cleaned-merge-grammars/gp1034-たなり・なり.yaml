        "nuance": "This pattern often implies that the continuation of the state or action is unexpected, undesirable, or simply a persistent result of the initial action, often suggesting neglect or lack of follow-up. It can also describe simply maintaining a physical posture. The use of (で) after なり is optional but can sometimes emphasize the persistent state. The less common なりの + [Noun] pattern describes a noun that is left in or maintains the state of the preceding verb's action, e.g., 「座ったなりの姿勢」 (a seated posture that is maintained)."
    },
    "etymology": "The なり in this construction is thought to derive from the noun 形 (katachi), meaning 'shape' or 'form'. This etymology highlights the idea that something remains in the same 'shape' or state as when the initial action occurred, emphasizing an unchanging or persistent condition.",
    "writeup": "The construction 「～たなり」, used after the past-tense (た-form) of a verb, indicates that a particular state or action persists uninterruptedly from the moment the initial verb's action was completed. It carries a nuance similar to 「～まま」, but often implies a more abrupt or unexpected continuation, frequently with an underlying sense of neglect, abandonment, or an undesirable persistence.\n\nThis pattern describes a direct consequence of an action that continues without change. For instance, if someone 'left (出た) and never returned', the 'never returning' is a continuous state directly stemming from the 'leaving'. While it can describe simple continuation, it frequently carries a negative or lamentable implication, suggesting that things have been left as they are, often to a detrimental effect.\n\nWhen 「～たなり」 is used to describe a physical posture or state, it highlights the maintenance of that position or condition after an action has been performed. For example, 「座ったなり」 describes someone remaining seated or staying in a seated posture.\n\nIt is important to distinguish this 「なり」 from the classic copula 「なり」 or the 「～なり～なり」 meaning 'either A or B'. This 「なり」 specifically functions as a conjunction, connecting the initial action to its persistent aftermath. The optional inclusion of 「で」 after 「なり」 can sometimes add emphasis to the continuous state.",

            "nuance": "While 「～たなり」 focuses on the *unaltered continuation* of a state *after* an action, often implying neglect or an unexpected outcome, 「まま」 can simply describe something being left in its current state, whether intentional or not. 「まま」 is broader and less emphasizes the consequence of a preceding action remaining unchanged. For example, 「開けっ放しのまま」 (left wide open) focuses on the state itself, whereas 「開けたなり」 (left open after opening it) stresses the action leading to the state and its persistence. "

            "nuance": "「～きり」 typically emphasizes exclusivity ('only' or 'just') or a definitive end to an action, after which something ceases. When used in a temporal sense, like 「～てきり」, it emphasizes that an action occurred *once* and has not been repeated since. For example, 「一度会ったきり」 (met only once). In contrast, 「～たなり」 emphasizes the *continuation of a state* that resulted from the action, rather than the action itself being singular or the last. It's about what persists, not what stopped or was limited to a single occurrence. "

            "nuance": "「以来」 is a more general term indicating 'since' a particular point in time or event. It simply marks the starting point of a period. 「～たなり」, however, specifically highlights that a state or action has *persisted without change* from that point forward, often with the implication of neglect or an undesirable outcome. For instance, 「卒業以来連絡がない」 (no contact since graduation) is general, while 「卒業したなり連絡がない」 (no contact ever since graduating) emphasizes the continued lack of contact as a direct and uninterrupted result of graduating."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「まま」, 「きり」, and 「以来」 can sometimes appear in contexts similar to 「～たなり」, each carries a distinct nuance. 「まま」 broadly describes something remaining as it is. 「きり」 emphasizes a singular occurrence or a cessation of action from a certain point. 「以来」 simply marks a temporal starting point for a period. In contrast, 「～たなり」 specifically conveys that a state or action has persisted without interruption since a prior event, often with a subtle implication of neglect or an unintended, continuous consequence. Understanding these subtle differences is key to mastering their usage.",
