jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: casual
  usage-context: General
etymology: 全然 (ぜんぜん) is formed from the kanji 全 (ぜん, zen) meaning "all" or "whole," repeated for emphasis.
  This repetition intensifies the meaning to convey a complete or total negation. Its usage has broadened
  over time to include emphatic positive statements, particularly in casual speech, reflecting a natural
  linguistic evolution towards intensifying expressions.
writeup: The adverb 全然 (ぜんぜん) is traditionally used with negative expressions to mean "not at all." For
  instance, when combined with ない, it conveys complete negation. This original usage emphasizes a complete
  lack or absence. However, in modern casual Japanese, especially among younger speakers, 全然 is increasingly
  used with positive statements to mean "totally" or "completely," adding strong emphasis. This is a significant
  shift in usage, and while common in spoken language, it might be perceived as informal or even incorrect
  in more formal or traditional contexts. In writing, both hiragana (ぜんぜん) and kanji (全然) are acceptable.
  Be aware that 全く (まったく), a similar expression, can sound more formal and sometimes carries a negative
  or disappointed nuance, depending on tone, making 全然 generally more neutral in its original negative
  context.
false_friends:
  - term: とても〜ない
    meaning: Not ~ at all, Cannot ~ at all
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とても〜ない」 is similar, but often implies a stronger inability or impossibility, or difficulty,
      than 全然, and is almost exclusively used with negatives.
    grammar_point: とても〜ない (cannot possibly ~)
  - term: すこしも〜ない
    meaning: Not even a little, Not at all, Not in the least, Never
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「少しも〜ない」 emphasizes the lack of even a small amount, highlighting a quantitative or minimal
      absence. 全然, on the other hand, focuses on the totality or completeness of the negation, implying
      an absolute absence without any trace.
    grammar_point: すこしも〜ない (not even a little)
  - term: 全く〜ない
    meaning: Not at all
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「全く〜ない」 is a more formal and slightly more emphatic synonym for complete negation. It can
      also be used positively, like 全然, but tends to retain a slightly more formal or serious tone. Its
      positive use is less common than 全然's.
    grammar_point: 全く〜ない (not at all)
  - term: ろくに〜ない
    meaning: Not properly; not sufficiently; hardly.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ろくに〜ない」 suggests a failure to do something adequately or properly, implying a lack of quality
      or effort, or a state of not being sufficient. This contrasts with 全然 (in its traditional use),
      which indicates a complete absence or total lack of something.
    grammar_point: ろくに〜ない (not properly)
  - term: あまり ない
    meaning: Not very, Not much
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「あまり ない」 indicates 'not very' or 'not much,' suggesting a partial negation or a low degree.
      「全然ない」 signifies a complete and absolute 'not at all.'
    grammar_point: あまり ない (not very or much)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid mixing these expressions, remember that 全然 is generally safe for
  casual conversation and emphasizes totality (either complete absence or complete presence, colloquially).
  全く is more formal and slightly stronger for negation, and its positive use is less frequent. Expressions
  like とても〜ない, 少しも〜ない, and ろくに〜ない highlight specific nuances such as strong inability, the lack of even
  a minimal amount, or insufficient effort, respectively. 「あまり ない」 is for partial negation, not total.
