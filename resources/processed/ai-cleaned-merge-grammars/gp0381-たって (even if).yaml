    "etymology": "「たって」 is a casual form of 「ても」, originating from 「たとて」, which combines the auxiliary verb 「た」 with the particle 「とて」, thought to be an old abbreviation of 「と言っても」. Thus, 「たって」 reflects the nuance of 「たと言っても」, meaning \"even if (A) is said, (B)\".",
    "writeup": "「たって」 is a casual structure equivalent to 「ても」 or 「でも」, usable with various words, translating to \"even if (A),\" \"even though (A),\" or \"no matter how (A).\" For verbs, 「たって」 conjugates like the standard 「た」 past-tense form. For い-adjectives, 「たって」 attaches to the 「く」-form. For nouns and な-adjectives, 「た」 changes to 「だ」, resulting in 「だって」 with the stem.",
