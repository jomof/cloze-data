    "etymology": "「たって」 is a casual form of 「ても」, originating from 「たとて」, which combines the auxiliary verb 「た」 with the particle 「とて」, thought to be an old abbreviation of 「と言っても」. Thus, 「たって」 reflects the nuance of 「たと言っても」, meaning \"even if (A) is said, (B)\".",
    "writeup": "「たって」 is a versatile casual structure primarily used in informal spoken Japanese, carrying a similar meaning to 「ても」 or 「でも」. It can be used with a wide variety of words and translates to \"even if (A),\" \"even though (A),\" or \"no matter how (A).\" It often indicates something counter to fact, suggesting that even if a certain condition were met, the desired or expected outcome would not occur. However, the counterfactual nature of this construction is not very strong.\n\nFor verbs, 「たって」 attaches directly to the standard 「た」 past-tense form. For い-adjectives, 「たって」 attaches to the 「く」-form (conjunctive form). For nouns and な-adjectives, the copula 「だ」 combines with 「って」, forming 「だって」 when referring to the present state, or 「だったって」 for the past state. When used with negative forms of verbs or い-adjectives (e.g., V-なかった, い-Adj-なく), it expresses \"even if (not)...\" or \"no matter how much (not).\" This grammar point is commonly used in casual conversations and can sometimes convey a sense of resignation or a blunt assertion.",

            "nuance": "「ようが～まいが」 is highly emphatic and expresses indifference to either outcome of a volitional action, suggesting 'regardless of whether one does X or not'. 「たって」 acknowledges a condition but emphasizes a contrasting result, not necessarily indifference to the action itself."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion between 「たって」 and similar expressions like 「ても」 or 「たとえ～ても」, remember that 「たって」 is notably more casual and colloquial. While 「ても」 is a versatile and common conditional form used across various registers, 「たって」 is primarily found in informal spoken Japanese. It often carries a blunt or emphatic nuance, sometimes expressing resignation or a strong personal feeling. For stronger, more formal, or truly hypothetical concessions, 「たとえ～ても」 is preferred. Expressions like 「たところで」, 「どうしても」, or 「ようが～まいが」 convey specific nuances such as futility, determination, or indifference, which differ from the general concessive 'even if' expressed by 「たって」. Be particularly mindful of 「だって」, which can function as a component of this grammar point (Noun/な-Adjective + だって) but also as a distinct, multi-functional word meaning 'because' or 'I heard'. Context is key to distinguishing these uses.",
