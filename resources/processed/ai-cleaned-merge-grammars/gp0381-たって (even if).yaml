  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used in casual, informal speech (tamego).
  function: Expresses a concessive condition, indicating that something will happen or be true regardless
    of the preceding condition.
  nuance: Often implies a sense of resignation, inevitability, or a strong counter-expectation. It is
    a more colloquial and sometimes blunter alternative to ～ても.
etymology: 「たって」 is a casual form of 「ても」, originating from 「たとて」, which combines the auxiliary verb 「た」
  with the particle 「とて」, thought to be an old abbreviation of 「と言っても」. Thus, 「たって」 reflects the nuance
  of 「たと言っても」, meaning "even if (A) is said, (B)".
writeup: |-
  「たって」 is a versatile casual structure primarily used in informal spoken Japanese, carrying a similar meaning to 「ても」 or 「でも」. It can be used with a wide variety of words and translates to "even if (A)," "even though (A)," or "no matter how (A)." It often indicates something counter to fact, suggesting that even if a certain condition were met, the desired or expected outcome would not occur. However, the counterfactual nature of this construction is not very strong.

  For verbs, 「たって」 attaches directly to the standard 「た」 past-tense form. For い-adjectives, 「たって」 attaches to the 「く」-form (conjunctive form). For nouns and な-adjectives, the copula 「だ」 combines with 「って」, forming 「だって」 when referring to the present state, or 「だったって」 for the past state. When used with negative forms of verbs or い-adjectives (e.g., V-なかった, い-Adj-なく), it expresses "even if (not)..." or "no matter how much (not)." This grammar point is commonly used in casual conversations and can sometimes convey a sense of resignation or a blunt assertion.
false_friends:
  - term: ては
    meaning: If, With, Since, Because
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ては」 can express conditions like 'if', 「たって」 specifically emphasizes a concessive condition,
      meaning 'even if something is the case' or 'even though'.
    grammar_point: ては (inevitable negative outcome)
  - term: たところで
    meaning: Even if ~ cannot or will not, Even though ~ not
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たところで」 implies a stronger sense of futility or that an action will have no significant impact,
      often suggesting a negative or disappointing result. 「たって」 is a more general 'even if' without necessarily
      implying futility.
    grammar_point: たところで (even if futile)
  - term: にしても
    meaning: Even if, Even though, Even when, Also
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「にしても」 can introduce concessions or additional points, often with a slightly more formal or
      objective tone, sometimes meaning 'even in that case'. 「たって」 is more colloquial and focuses on a
      single contrasting condition.
    grammar_point: にしても (even if)
  - term: たとえ〜ても
    meaning: Even if…is the case, Supposing that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たとえ～ても」 is a more formal and emphatic way to express a hypothetical or extreme concession,
      often used in written language or more structured speech. 「たって」 is a casual, spoken alternative.
    grammar_point: たとえ〜ても (even if)
  - term: どうしても
    meaning: Regardless of, No matter what
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「どうしても」 emphasizes a strong determination or an unavoidable situation, often focusing on the
      speaker's will or an inherent nature. 「たって」 conveys a contrast despite a condition, without necessarily
      implying strong will or inevitability.
    grammar_point: どうしても (inevitably or absolutely)
  - term: だって
    meaning: Because; I heard/was said; But; Even (particle)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「だって」 is a component of this grammar point, it also functions independently with multiple
      meanings, such as providing a reason ('because'), reporting hearsay ('I heard'), or as a mild contradictory
      conjunction ('but'). The 「たって」 grammar point specifically means 'even if/though'.
    grammar_point: だって (casual reason・hearsay・even)
  - term: ようが〜まいが
    meaning: Even if; no matter what; whether or not (emphatic)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ようが～まいが」 is highly emphatic and expresses indifference to either outcome of a volitional
      action, suggesting 'regardless of whether one does X or not'. 「たって」 acknowledges a condition but
      emphasizes a contrasting result, not necessarily indifference to the action itself.
    grammar_point: ようが〜まいが (regardless of whether)
  - term: ても
    meaning: Even if, Even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ても」 is the standard and most versatile form for expressing 'even if' or 'even though' across
      all registers. 「たって」 is a more casual, colloquial, and sometimes blunter alternative, primarily
      used in informal spoken Japanese.
    grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion between 「たって」 and similar expressions like 「ても」 or 「たとえ～ても」,
  remember that 「たって」 is notably more casual and colloquial. While 「ても」 is a versatile and common conditional
  form used across various registers, 「たって」 is primarily found in informal spoken Japanese. It often carries
  a blunt or emphatic nuance, sometimes expressing resignation or a strong personal feeling. For stronger,
  more formal, or truly hypothetical concessions, 「たとえ～ても」 is preferred. Expressions like 「たところで」, 「どうしても」,
  or 「ようが～まいが」 convey specific nuances such as futility, determination, or indifference, which differ
  from the general concessive 'even if' expressed by 「たって」. Be particularly mindful of 「だって」, which can
  function as a component of this grammar point (Noun/な-Adjective + だって) but also as a distinct, multi-functional
  word meaning 'because' or 'I heard'. Context is key to distinguishing these uses.

      of pessimistic outlooks.

        english: Even if you are very busy, you must take care of your health.
        hint: 「ても」 is a versatile concessive form. 「たって」 conveys a similar meaning but in a more casual,
          spoken context, often with a slightly stronger emphasis or bluntness. We are looking for a direct,
          emphatic piece of advice.
    scene: An older person offering stern but caring advice to a young, hardworking professional who frequently
      overworks.
    register: formal
    setting: supportive
    speaker_age: older

      universal importance of health. The use of 「～なければならない」 adds a serious, obligatory tone, often used
      by an older speaker offering wisdom or guidance.

          social etiquette.
    scene: A friend gently reminding another about proper social etiquette while watching a movie together.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: 「面白くなくたって」 sets up a concession that addresses a potential personal disinterest. The latter

      This nuance highlights the speaker's adherence to social norms.

        hint: 「でさえ」 emphasizes an extreme or unexpected case, suggesting 'even something as (unexpected
          as) X'. 「だって」 in this context has a broader, more inclusive 'even X' meaning, often used to
          assert a general truth. We are looking for a general assertion.
    scene: A parent arguing with another adult who dismisses a child's input, advocating for the child's
      autonomy.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious

      a fundamental right that applies universally.

        english: Even if you were a student, the responsibility for this project is not light.
        hint: 「たとえ～としても」 is a more formal and somewhat stronger hypothetical concessive. 「たって」 offers
          a more casual and blunt expression, often implying that a past state is irrelevant to the current
          situation. We are looking for a direct, professional reprimand.
    scene: A project manager addressing a junior team member who is trying to shirk responsibility by
      citing their previous student status.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「たとえ学生だったって」 dismisses a past status as an excuse for current responsibility. The phrase emphasizes
      that regardless of one's background, the weight of a professional undertaking remains. This firm
      tone is typical in a professional, serious setting.

        english: Even if you didn't study at all, you still have to take the exam.
        hint: 「としても」 can be used with negative past forms for 'even if it was not the case'. 「たって」 conveys
          a similar meaning but with a more direct and possibly reproachful tone. We are looking for a
          strict instructional context.
    scene: A strict teacher addressing a student who is completely unprepared for an upcoming examination.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    speaker_age: older

      of neglecting duties.

        english: No matter how hungry you are, you should not eat expired food.
        hint: 「ても」 is the general form for 'even if' or 'no matter how'. 「たって」 provides a more colloquial
          and direct expression, often used in warning or advice within casual conversation. We are looking
          for practical advice between housemates.
    scene: A concerned housemate giving practical advice to another who is about to eat questionable food.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: The phrase 「いくらお腹が空いていたって」 acknowledges a strong physical need (hunger) but immediately follows
      with a firm health warning. This structure, common in casual advice, highlights that even a strong
      desire does not override safety precautions.
  - english: Even if I succeed after working so hard, no one will probably appreciate it.
    japanese:
      - そんな に 頑張っ た の に、もし 成功 し {たっ て} 誰 も 評価 し て くれ ない だろう。

      - competing_japanese:
          - そんな に 頑張っ た の に、もし 成功 し て も 誰 も 評価 し て くれ ない だろう。
        english: Even if I succeed after working so hard, no one will probably appreciate it.
        hint: 「ても」 is a more neutral concessive, whereas 「たって」 here subtly emphasizes the speaker's resigned
          or melancholic feeling about the futility of their efforts, even if successful. We are looking
          for a tone of resignation.
    scene: An employee feeling unappreciated at work, confiding in a colleague about their lack of recognition.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: 「もし成功したって」 expresses a hypothetical positive outcome that is, however, undermined by a sense
      of futility and lack of recognition. The speaker's use of 「誰も評価してくれないだろう」 conveys deep disappointment
      and a resigned attitude, characteristic of a melancholic state.
  - english: Even if everyone says it's impossible, I'm going to try.
    japanese:
      - みんな が 無理 {だ って} 言っ {たっ て}、私 は やっ て みる よ。

    english_literally: Even if everyone says it's impossible, I will try.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - みんな が 無理 だ と 言っ て も、私 は やっ て みる よ。
        english: Even if everyone says it's impossible, I will try.
        hint: 「ても」 is a general 'even if' form. 「たって」 offers a more colloquial and sometimes blunt assertion
          against opposing opinions. We are looking for a firm, personal resolve.
    scene: A young, determined person talking to a friend about pursuing a difficult goal despite discouragement
      from others.
    register: casual
    setting: optimistic
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「みんなが無理だっていったって」 sets up a strong contrast with the speaker's resolve. The use
      of 「私」 and 「やってみるよ」 conveys a personal determination, typical of someone expressing optimism and
      a 'can-do' attitude, especially in casual conversation.
  - english: Even if it's just instant noodles, I'm happy.
    japanese:
      - カップ 麺 {だ って}、嬉しい よ。
      - インスタント ラーメン {だ って}、十分 嬉しい よ。
      - カップ 麺 {だ って}、文句 言わ ない よ。
    english_literally: Even instant noodles, I am happy.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - カップ 麺 で も、嬉しい よ。
        english: Even if it's instant noodles, I'm happy.
        hint: 「でも」 can mean 'even if' or 'even just'. 「だって」 emphasizes a slightly more surprising or lower-tier
          item being accepted, often with a sense of 'even this humble thing'. We are looking for an acceptance
          of something simple.
    scene: A student coming home exhausted and hungry, but expressing contentment with a simple meal.
    register: casual
    setting: optimistic
    nuance: 「カップ麺だって、嬉しいよ」 highlights the speaker's low expectations or humble satisfaction. The 「だって」
      implies that even something as simple or basic as instant noodles is enough to bring happiness,
      reflecting a positive and appreciative outlook despite circumstances. This is a common sentiment
      expressed in casual, everyday life.
post_example_writeup: As illustrated by these examples, 「たって」 is highly versatile and can express concessions
  across different parts of speech and tenses. Its casual nature makes it suitable for everyday conversations,
  but be mindful that its bluntness might not be appropriate in more formal or polite settings where 「ても」
  or other, more formal concessive forms would be preferred. The specific nuance often depends on the
  speaker's emotional state or the context, ranging from resignation to firm assertion.
