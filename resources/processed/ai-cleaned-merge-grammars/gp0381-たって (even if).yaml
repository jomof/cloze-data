    "etymology": "「たって」 is a casual form of 「ても」, originating from 「たとて」, which combines the auxiliary verb 「た」 with the particle 「とて」, thought to be an old abbreviation of 「と言っても」. Thus, 「たって」 reflects the nuance of 「たと言っても」, meaning \"even if (A) is said, (B)\".",
    "writeup": "「たって」 is a casual structure primarily used in informal spoken Japanese, carrying a similar meaning to 「ても」 or 「でも」. It can be used with a wide variety of words and translates to \"even if (A),\" \"even though (A),\" or \"no matter how (A).\" It often indicates something counter to fact, suggesting that even if a certain condition were met, the desired or expected outcome would not occur. However, the counterfactual nature of this construction is not very strong. For verbs, 「たって」 attaches to the standard 「た」 past-tense form. For い-adjectives, 「たって」 attaches to the 「く」-form. For nouns and な-adjectives, the copula 「だ」 combines with 「って」, forming 「だって」 with the stem.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion between 「たって」 and similar expressions like 「ても」 or 「たとえ〜ても」, remember that 「たって」 is notably more casual and colloquial. While 「ても」 is a versatile and common conditional form used across various registers, 「たって」 is primarily found in informal spoken Japanese. It often carries a blunt or emphatic nuance, sometimes expressing resignation or a strong personal feeling. For stronger, more formal, or truly hypothetical concessions, 「たとえ〜ても」 is preferred. Expressions like 「たところで」, 「どうしても」, or 「ようが〜まいが」 convey specific nuances such as futility, determination, or indifference, which differ from the general concessive 'even if' expressed by 「たって」.",
