    "etymology": "たって is considered a casual form of ても, but it originally comes from たとて, which is a combination of the auxiliary verb た and the particle とて, an old-fashioned abbreviation of と言っても. Therefore, たって still carries the nuance of 「たと言っても」 'even if (A) is said, (B)'",
    "writeup": "**たって** is a casual structure similar in meaning to ても or でも. It translates to \"even if (A),\" \"even though (A),\" or \"no matter how (A).\" For verbs, **たって** attaches to the past tense た-form. い-adjectives attach to the く-form. For nouns and な-adjectives, the だ changes to a plain form, resulting in **だって**. This is a **casual** expression, mostly used in **spoken Japanese**.",
