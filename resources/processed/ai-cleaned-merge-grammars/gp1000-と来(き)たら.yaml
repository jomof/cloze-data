    "writeup": "The grammar point 「と来(き)たら」, *tokitara*, is used to introduce a topic and express a strong feeling or opinion about it. Literally, it combines the particle 「と」, *to*, the verb 「来る」, *kuru* (to come), and the conditional 「たら」, *tara*. 「と来(き)たら」 marks the topic the speaker wants to discuss, and what follows reveals their immediate thoughts or strong feelings. Often, what follows begins with 「やっぱり」 or 「やはり」 (as expected). The implication is that the relationship between the topic and the speaker's reaction is obvious. Be mindful that it can sometimes carry a nuance of criticism or exasperation depending on the context.",
    "etymology": "The phrase 「と来(き)たら」 comes from the idea of 'when it comes to...' something, the speaker has a strong and immediate reaction or association.",
