        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "usage-context": "Used when the speaker wants to rephrase or correct something they just said, providing a more precise or appropriate expression. It often implies that the first statement was not entirely accurate or complete.",
        "nuance": "Indicates a desire to refine one's previous statement for greater clarity or accuracy."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「と言うか」 literally translates to \"or, if I were to say\". It is derived from the verb 「言う」 (iu, to say) and the question marker 「か」 (ka).",
    "writeup": "「と言うか」 is used to rephrase or correct a previous statement, offering a more accurate or appropriate way of expressing oneself. Think of it as a way to say \"or rather\" or \"I should say.\" It implies that the initial statement wasn't quite right, and the speaker is now refining their wording for better clarity. It's a common phrase in both spoken and written Japanese for adding nuance and precision to your speech.",

            "nuance": "「むしろ」 emphasizes a preference or a stronger alternative, often contrasting with the previous statement. 「と言うか」 is about clarifying or finding a more precise expression for what was already said, often an internal thought process rather than a direct contrast."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「と言うか」, 「と言うより」, 「つまり」, and 「むしろ」 all serve to clarify or refine a statement, they do so in slightly different ways. 「と言うか」 presents an alternate, more precise way of phrasing something previously stated. 「と言うより」 indicates a stronger or more accurate description, emphasizing a comparison. 「つまり」 summarizes or explains the previous statement in different words. 「むしろ」 indicates a preference or a stronger alternative that might contradict a previous statement. Consider the specific nuance you want to convey when choosing between these expressions.",

            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "friendly",
            "nuance": "The speaker refines \"kind\" to \"too naive\" using 「と言うか」, suggesting the initial description wasn't precise enough to capture the full picture of the person's character. 「お人好し」 implies someone easily fooled or taken advantage of.",
            "etymology": "The phrase 「お人好し」(ohitoyoshi) combines 「人」(hito, person) with 「好し」(yoshi, good), literally meaning 'good person', but often implying being too naive or easily led."

This internal refinement is common in casual self-talk. The contraction of 「ている」 to 「てる」 in the second Japanese example sentence is common in casual speech.",

This avoids a blunt \"No\" by explaining the actual situation. The phrase 「直接 の 関わり は ない です」 indicates a lack of direct involvement, maintaining a polite semi-formal tone.",
