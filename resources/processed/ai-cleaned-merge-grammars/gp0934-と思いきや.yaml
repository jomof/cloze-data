        "[Sentence in plain form] + と思いきや": "Used to express surprise or unexpected results contrary to one's initial thought or expectation."
    },
    "jlpt": "N1",
    "meaning": "Despite initial thoughts, it turned out to be the opposite; just when one thought X, Y happened unexpectedly.",

        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "semi-formal",
        "usage-context": "general",
        "function": "Expresses a strong contrast between an initial expectation and an unexpected reality.",
        "nuance": "Highlights the speaker's surprise and the dramatic shift from what was anticipated."
    },
    "etymology": "The expression 「と思いきや」 is derived from 「と」 (case-marking particle), 「思い」 (conjunctive form of the verb 「思う」, 'to think'), 「き」 (classical auxiliary verb indicating past tense), and 「や」 (classical binding particle marking questions). Literally, it translates to something like 'I thought it *had* been (A), but I guess (B)'.",
    "writeup": "The phrase 「と思いきや」 is a versatile expression used to convey that a situation turned out to be contrary to what was initially expected or thought. It captures a sense of surprise or unexpectedness, often translating to phrases like 'despite having thought X, Y happened' or 'just when I thought X, Y unexpectedly occurred.' The core function is to highlight a stark contrast between an initial assumption or expectation and the surprising reality that unfolds. This expression is particularly effective when the speaker wants to emphasize their personal astonishment or the dramatic twist of events. \n\nGrammatically, 「と思いきや」 follows a verb, adjective, or noun phrase in its plain form. The first part of the sentence (before 「と思いきや」) expresses the speaker's initial thought or expectation, while the second part describes the unexpected reality. It is important to note that the second clause, describing the actual situation, will almost always be in a past tense or convey a completed action, as it represents a realization or an outcome that has already occurred.\n\nWhile its origins lie in classical Japanese—combining the particle 「と」 (quotative), the conjunctive form 「思い」 (from 思う, 'to think'), the classical past tense auxiliary 「き」, and the rhetorical particle 「や」—in modern Japanese, 「と思いきや」 functions as a set phrase emphasizing the speaker's surprise at an unpredicted outcome. Although the particle 「か」 can sometimes precede 「と思いきや」, it merely adds further rhetorical emphasis to the inherent questioning nature of 「や」, without significantly altering the meaning.",
