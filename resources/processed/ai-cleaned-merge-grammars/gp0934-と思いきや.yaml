    },
    "etymology": "The expression 「と思いきや」 is derived from 「と」 (case-marking particle), 「思い」 (conjunctive form of the verb 「思う」, 'to think'), 「き」 (classical auxiliary verb indicating past tense), and 「や」 (classical binding particle marking questions). Literally, it translates to something like 'I thought it *had* been (A), but I guess (B)'.",
    "writeup": "「と思いきや」 is used to express that something turned out differently than expected. It often translates to \"despite having thought (A), (B),\" or \"when I thought that (A), it was actually (B).\" It emphasizes the speaker's surprise that the reality (B) does not match the initial assumption (A). A past tense phrase will almost always appear in the second part of the sentence, (B), as it is considered to be the actual situation which has come about, or has been realized by the speaker. Caution: this grammar point is used when the speaker has come to realize that their initial thought was wrong.",
