    "etymology": "The grammar point 「と思いきや」 comes from a combination of 「と」 (a particle), 「思い」 (the noun form of 「思う」 - to think), 「き」 (a classical auxiliary verb indicating past tense), and 「や」 (a classical particle marking a question or emphasis). Literally, it could be interpreted as 'I thought it was...', but it is now used as a set phrase to express surprise or a contrast with one's initial thought.",
    "writeup": "「と思いきや」 is used to express that something turned out differently than expected. It often translates to \"I thought...but,\" \"When I thought that...but,\" or \"Despite having thought...\" It highlights the speaker's surprise when reality deviates from their initial assumption. 「と思いきや」 follows a word or phrase in its plain form. A past tense phrase will always appear in the latter half of the sentence, as it describes the actual situation.",

            "setting": "storytelling",
            "nuance": "The phrase 「お疲れさん」 is a less formal way of saying 「お疲れ様です」. This makes the register semi-formal, rather than formal.",
            "etymology": "「お疲れさん」 is a shortened version of 「お疲れ様です」, indicating 'good work' or 'thank you for your hard work'."
