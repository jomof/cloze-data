details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Primarily used in formal writing and speech, indicating a strong conviction or concession.
    Often appears with interrogative or concessive terms.
etymology: The grammar point 「であれ」 derives from 「である」, the formal copula, which itself is a combination
  of the conjunctive form of the auxiliary verb 「だ」 and the verb 「ある」. 「あれ」 is the imperative form of
  「ある」. The more literal meaning is closer to "so it's (A), (B) still won't be affected." 「であろうと」 is the
  positive volitional form combined with the case-marking particle 「と」.
writeup: 「であれ」 functions as an extension of 「である」, the formal copula. It's often used to express a strong
  will or conviction. 「あれ」 is the imperative form of 「ある」, while 「であろうと」 is the positive volitional form
  combined with the case-marking particle 「と」. Both structures are usually translated as "even if (A),
  (B)" or "no matter if (A), (B)". The more literal meaning of each is closer to "so it's (A), (B) still
  won't be affected," emphasizing that (A) has no relation to the result, similar to saying "so what if
  it is" in English. 「であれ」 and 「であろうと」 primarily attach to nouns and な-adjective stems in sentences that
  express a question or assumption using words like 「どんな」 or 「たとえ」. Because both 「であれ」 and 「であろうと」 use
  structures indicating strong will, they're frequently used in sentences where the speaker expresses
  their opinions or resolutions.

  - term: であれ〜であれ
    meaning: Whether or, Or, No matter which, In either case
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「であれ〜であれ」 (and its variant 「であろうと〜であろうと」) presents two or more options and states that either
      one is acceptable or true, whereas a single 「であれ」 or 「であろうと」 concedes a point or expresses strong
      conviction about one condition.
    grammar_point: であれ〜であれ (whether... or...)
  - term: にしろ〜にしろ
    meaning: Whether… or
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「であれ〜であれ」, 「にしろ〜にしろ」 presents two options, but it's less formal than 「であれ〜であれ」
      and 「であれ」.
    grammar_point: にしろ〜にしろ (whether... or...)
  - term: にせよ・にしろ
    meaning: Even if, Even though, No matter, Whether… or
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「にせよ」 and 「にしろ」 are less formal alternatives that can be used in more casual conversations.
      They also carry a similar nuance of concession or acceptance of a condition but without the strong,
      definitive tone of 「であれ」.
    grammar_point: にせよ・にしろ (even if or no matter)
  - term: とはいえ
    meaning: Though, Although (I admit that), Be that as it may, Nonetheless
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「とはいえ」 introduces a contrasting statement after acknowledging a certain fact. It is similar
      to "though" or "although" in English. Unlike 「であれ」, it doesn't emphasize a strong will or conviction,
      but more of a qualification of a previous statement.
    grammar_point: とはいえ (though)
  - term: 何しろ
    meaning: No wonder, After all, In fact, Because, At any rate
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「何しろ」 is used to provide a reason or justification for something. It doesn't carry the conditional
      or concessive meaning of 「であれ」, nor does it express strong conviction; rather, it introduces explanatory
      context.
    grammar_point: 何しろ (anyway・after all)
  - term: 〜でも
    meaning: Even if, even though, no matter
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜でも」 is a more general and less formal way to express concession or 'no matter' compared
      to 「であれ」. It can attach to nouns or various conjugated forms of verbs/adjectives. While similar
      in meaning, 「であれ」 conveys a stronger, more assertive tone, especially in formal contexts, implying
      a definitive truth regardless of the condition.
    grammar_point: でも (even・any・no matter)
  - term: 〜ても
    meaning: Even if, even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜ても」 is a common concessive conjunction that signifies 'even if' or 'even though'. It attaches
      to the te-form of verbs and adjectives. While sharing the concessive nuance with 「であれ」, 「〜ても」 is
      broader in application and lacks the strong, formal assertion or emphasis on an unchangeable truth
      that 「であれ」 carries.
    grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing 「であれ」 and 「であろうと」 with similar expressions, it is crucial
  to recognize their core nuance. These forms are used to emphasize a strong conviction or concession,
  often in formal or declarative contexts, implying that a certain truth or resolution stands firm regardless
  of the stated condition. While other expressions like 「にしろ」 or 「とはいえ」 convey concession or contrast,
  they generally lack the definitive, assertive tone inherent in 「であれ」. Understanding this difference
  in impact and formality is key to their correct usage.

        english: Even if the situation is difficult, it's important to remain calm.
        hint: '"〜でも" is a common, less formal way to say ''even if'' or ''no matter'', but "であれ" is more
          formal and emphasizes a strong, unchangeable truth regardless of the condition. We''re looking
          for a formal, assertive tone.'
    scene: A crisis management expert giving advice to a team.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The use of 「どんなに〜であれ」 emphasizes the universality of the advice, suggesting that calmness
      is critical in any severe situation. The choice of 「重要だ」 adds a sense of objective truth.
    etymology: The phrase 「冷静 さ を 保つ」 (reiseiteki sa o tamotsu) literally means "to maintain calmness,"
      stressing self-control under pressure. This expression is commonly used to highlight the importance
      of composure in challenging circumstances, underscoring a virtue of self-control prevalent in Japanese
      culture for effective problem-solving and decision-making. Its direct and functional meaning makes
      it versatile across various formal and instructional contexts, from business to martial arts, where
      maintaining a clear mind is crucial for optimal performance and decision-making.
  - english: Whatever his actions may have been, he is responsible for the consequences.
    japanese:

        hint: '"〜であっても" conveys ''even if it is'', but "であろうと" carries a stronger, more definitive, and

          for a strong assertion of the condition.'
    scene: A judge explaining legal principles in court.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「何 であろうと」 highlights the irrelevance of the specific actions themselves, focusing solely on
      the accountability for the outcome. The phrase 「責任 は 彼 に ある」 places clear, undeniable responsibility.
    etymology: '「責任」 (sekinin) combines 「責」 (responsibility) and 「任」 (duty), emphasizing the burden of
      accountability. This compound word succinctly captures the essence of legal and moral accountability,
      reflecting a Japanese cultural emphasis on fulfilling one''s obligations. The characters themselves
      hint at the depth of the concept: 「責」 evokes a sense of blame or duty, while 「任」 signifies a task
      or burden. This combination portrays responsibility not just as a consequence but as an entrusted
      duty that must be upheld.'

        english: No matter how difficult the situation, I am determined to achieve this goal.

    setting: persuasive

    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「いかに〜であれ」 is paired with 「決意だ」 to convey a powerful and unwavering commitment. The phrase
      「困難な状況」 emphasizes the difficulty that will be overcome, underscoring the speaker's determination.
    etymology: 「決意」 (ketsui) combines 「決」 (to decide) and 「意」 (will/mind), signifying a firm resolution.

        english: Even if the appearance is flashy, it's meaningless without substance.
        hint: '"〜にしても" implies ''even if'' or ''even though'', but "であろうと" provides a stronger, more definitive
          assertion of the state, especially when making a critical judgment. We''re looking for a strong
          statement of judgment.'
    scene: An art critic reviewing an exhibition.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「いかに〜であろうと」 emphasizes the superficiality of appearance without substance. The strong negative
      conclusion 「意味 が ない」 reinforces the critical judgment, highlighting the importance of intrinsic
      value.
    etymology: 「中身」 (nakami) refers to the 'contents' or 'substance,' often used figuratively to describe
      character or quality.
  - english: Even a top athlete will quickly decline if they neglect daily practice.
    japanese:

        english: Even if they are a top athlete, they will quickly decline if they neglect daily practice.
        hint: While "〜でも" can mean 'even if', "であれ" combined with "たとえ" emphasizes a universal truth that

          principle being stated.
    scene: A coach explaining the importance of consistent effort to their team.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「たとえ〜であれ」 highlights that even those at the peak are not exempt from the need for consistent
      effort, emphasizing the universal nature of the principle. 「怠れば」 (if they neglect) and 「衰える」 (will
      decline) convey the inevitable consequence of negligence.
    etymology: 「怠る」 (okotaru) means "to neglect" or "to be negligent," often used in contexts of duty
      or practice.

        hint: '"にしろ〜にしろ" also means ''whether...or'', but "であろうと〜であろうと" is a more formal and emphatic

    scene: An HR manager explaining company policy during an orientation.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of paired 「〜であろうと〜であろうと」 emphatically includes all levels of staff, reinforcing the
      notion of universal application of the rule. The phrase 「全員 に 適用 される」 directly states this comprehensive
      applicability in a formal manner.

      into practice," commonly used in policy or legal contexts.

    scene: An elder reflecting on societal changes.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective

      of human connection. 「代え難い」 strongly asserts the irreplaceable nature of this warmth, emphasizing
      a universal truth about human needs.
    etymology: 「代え難い」 (kaegatai) means 'irreplaceable' or 'difficult to substitute', often used for things
      of unique and profound value.
post_example_writeup: These examples demonstrate the versatility of 「であれ」 and 「であろうと」 in expressing strong
  conviction or concession across various formal contexts, from philosophical statements to legal principles
  and motivational speeches. Pay close attention to how they are used with interrogative words like 「どんなに」
  and 「いかに」 to convey 'no matter how' or 'whatever.' The common thread is a definitive assertion that
  a certain condition holds true regardless of the preceding statement.
