    "etymology": "「それ」 comes from the verb 「添う (そう)」 which means \"to accompany\" or \"to be close to.\" Over time, 「そう」 evolved into 「それ」, indicating something close to the listener or the topic at hand. Its use as a demonstrative pronoun to refer to something conceptually close to the listener or previously mentioned highlights this historical connection to something 'accompanying' the conversation or the listener's immediate sphere.",
    "writeup": "「それ」 is a pronoun (代名詞, *daimeishi*) that translates to \"that\" in English. It refers to something closer to the listener than the speaker, whether it's physically present or conceptually related to the listener's knowledge or recent statements. Furthermore, 「それ」 can refer back to something previously mentioned in the conversation, serving as a cohesive device to link ideas or statements. It can be used to refer to something said earlier within the same sentence or something another person has just said. It is part of the Ko-So-A-Do series of demonstratives, which indicate relative distance: 「これ」 refers to something close to the speaker. 「あれ」 refers to something distant from both the speaker and listener. 「どれ」 is an interrogative pronoun used to ask \"which one?\" among several items. Understanding the relative distance — close to speaker (ko), close to listener (so), distant from both (a), or interrogative (do) — is key to correctly using these pronouns. While 「それ」 is a versatile pronoun, its kanji form, 其れ, is rarely used in modern Japanese.",
