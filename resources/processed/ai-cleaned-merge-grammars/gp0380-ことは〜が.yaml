    "etymology": "This construction is formed by combining 「こと」 (koto), a nominalizing particle that turns the preceding clause into a noun phrase, with the topic particle 「は」 (wa). The repeated word before 「ことは」 and after it, combined with the contrasting particle 「が」 (ga) or 「けど」 (kedo), serves to emphasize the truth of the initial statement while immediately introducing a contradictory or limiting condition. Etymologically, 「ことは」 asserts the 'matter' or 'fact' (こと) as the topic (は), and the subsequent 「が/けど」 introduces the counterpoint. This repetition creates a strong concession, acknowledging the primary point before pivoting to a nuance or counter-argument.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ことは〜が」 is a fixed expression used to acknowledge the truth of a statement (A) while simultaneously presenting a contrasting or limiting condition (B). It functions much like saying, \"It is true that (A), but (B),\" or \"Although (A), (B).\" The structure demands that the same word, whether a verb, adjective, or noun, is repeated immediately before 「ことは」 and again before 「が」 (or 「けど」). This repetition strongly emphasizes that the speaker fully recognizes the veracity of (A), yet wishes to highlight a different, often counter-intuitive, aspect. While the fundamental truth of (A) is conceded, the speaker's main point often lies in the subsequent contrasting information (B).",

The use of 「ことは〜が」 emphasizes a full concession to the initial truth of being able to read kanji, before immediately stating the limitation, which a simple 「〜が」 conjunction would not convey with the same level of emphasis on acknowledgement."
