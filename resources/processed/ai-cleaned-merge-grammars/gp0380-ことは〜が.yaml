    "etymology": "This construction is formed by combining 「こと」 (koto), a nominalizing particle that turns the preceding clause into a noun phrase, with the topic particle 「は」 (wa). The repeated word before 「ことは」 and after it, combined with the contrasting particle 「が」 (ga) or 「けど」 (kedo), serves to emphasize the truth of the initial statement while immediately introducing a contradictory or limiting condition. Etymologically, 「ことは」 asserts the 'matter' or 'fact' (こと) as the topic (は), and the subsequent 「が/けど」 introduces the counterpoint. This repetition creates a strong concession, acknowledging the primary point before pivoting to a nuance or counter-argument.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ことは〜が」 is a fixed expression used to acknowledge the truth of a statement (A) while simultaneously presenting a contrasting or limiting condition (B). It functions much like saying, \"It is true that (A), but (B),\" or \"Although (A), (B).\" The general structure involves repeating the same word (verb, i-adjective, na-adjective, or noun) immediately before 「ことは」 and again after it, before 「が」 (or 「けど」). However, for verbs and i-adjectives in the past tense, it is also common, especially in conversation, for the first instance (before 「ことは」) to be in the non-past (plain) form, while the second instance retains the past tense. This repetition strongly emphasizes that the speaker fully recognizes the veracity of (A), yet wishes to highlight a different, often counter-intuitive, aspect. While the fundamental truth of (A) is conceded, the speaker's main point often lies in the subsequent contrasting information (B).",
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "It is crucial to understand that this pattern emphasizes a concession and then introduces a counterpoint, allowing for a nuanced expression of truth with a caveat. While other grammatical structures might also connect two contrasting clauses, this specific repetition highlights the speaker's acknowledgment of the initial statement's truth before presenting the limiting information.",

            "nuance": "The speaker acknowledges their English ability using 「話せることは話せる」, but the following 「まだ自信がないです」 expresses a limitation. The formal tone with 「です」 maintains politeness.",
            "etymology": "The use of 「話せる」 (hanaseru) is the potential form of the verb 話す (hanasu, to speak), indicating ability to speak. The repetition emphasizes the affirmative side of the ability before the negative counterpoint.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene implies a self-assessment where the speaker first affirms an ability before immediately highlighting a weakness, perfectly fitting the concessive nuance of 「ことは〜が」."

    "post_example_writeup": "The core function of 「ことは〜が」 is to present a concession followed by a contrasting or limiting statement. The specific word repeated before 「ことは」 can be a verb, an i-adjective, a na-adjective, or a noun. The choice between 「が」 and 「けど」 is stylistic; 「が」 is generally more formal or direct, while 「けど」 is softer and more conversational.",
