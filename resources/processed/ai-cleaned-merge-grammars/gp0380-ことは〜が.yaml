    "etymology": "This construction is formed by combining 「こと」 (koto), a nominalizing particle that turns the preceding clause into a noun phrase, with the topic particle 「は」 (wa). The repeated word before 「ことは」 and after it, combined with the contrasting particle 「が」 (ga) or 「けど」 (kedo), serves to emphasize the truth of the initial statement while immediately introducing a contradictory or limiting condition. Etymologically, 「ことは」 asserts the 'matter' or 'fact' (こと) as the topic (は), and the subsequent 「が/けど」 introduces the counterpoint. This repetition creates a strong concession, acknowledging the primary point before pivoting to a nuance or counter-argument.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ことは〜が」 is a fixed expression used to acknowledge the truth of a statement (A) while simultaneously presenting a contrasting or limiting condition (B). It functions much like saying, \"It is true that (A), but (B),\" or \"Although (A), (B).\" The structure demands that the same word, whether a verb, adjective, or noun, is repeated immediately before 「ことは」 and again before 「が」 (or 「けど」). This repetition strongly emphasizes that the speaker fully recognizes the veracity of (A), yet wishes to highlight a different, often counter-intuitive, aspect. While the fundamental truth of (A) is conceded, the speaker's main point often lies in the subsequent contrasting information (B).",

            "register": "formal",
            "setting": "informative",
            "nuance": "The speaker acknowledges their ability to read kanji by repeating 「読める」, but immediately qualifies it with 「簡単な漢字しか読めないです」, indicating a limitation. The use of 「です」 keeps the register polite and formal."

        {
            "japanese": "新しい家は{広いことは広い}けど、家具が多いから狭く見える。",
            "english": "My new house is indeed spacious, but it looks small because there's too much furniture.",
            "scene": "Two friends casually discussing home size.",
            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "informative",
            "nuance": "The speaker confirms the house's spaciousness with 「広いことは広い」, but the following clause 「家具が多いから狭く見える」 introduces a drawback. 「けど」 provides a softer, more conversational contrast than 「が」."

            "scene": "A user expressing mixed feelings about a gadget.",
            "register": "casual",
            "setting": "informative",
            "nuance": "Here, 「便利であることは便利である」 employs the more formal `である` form for a na-adjective, adding a slightly more assertive tone to the concession. The casual 「けど」 then softens the overall sentence."

            "setting": "informative",
            "nuance": "The speaker repeats 「行った」 (past tense of 行く) to confirm their trip. The follow-up 「東京の空港を見ただけだよ」 minimizes the experience, indicating that the 'trip' was very superficial. The informal ending 「〜だよ」 is common in casual conversation."

            "setting": "supportive",
            "nuance": "The repetition of 「濡れた」 confirms the fact of getting wet. However, 「大したことはなかった」 dismisses its significance, demonstrating how this pattern can be used to downplay an event. The neutral 「が」 allows for a direct follow-up without being overly confrontational."

            "setting": "informative",
            "nuance": "The speaker confirms having a fever with 「出たことは出た」, but immediately provides reassuring information that it wasn't serious. This structure is effective for correcting assumptions or providing precise details after an initial affirmation."

            "nuance": "The speaker acknowledges their affection by repeating 「好きだ」, but the following 「結婚は考えられない」 introduces a definitive and painful limitation. The direct plain form 「好きだ」, particularly when used by a male speaker in this context of emotional declaration and rejection, contributes to a tone that is both clear and somewhat blunt, fitting the melancholic setting. The `とは` further emphasizes the speaker's true feelings.",
            "etymology": "The use of `だ` here is the plain form of the copula, commonly used in casual speech. The `とは` adds emphasis, conveying a sense of 'it is indeed the case that...'"

The follow-up 「そろそろ終電の時間だね」 gently introduces the need to end the conversation due to external circumstances. The use of 「〜だね」 is soft and conversational, often employed by female speakers to express shared understanding or make a gentle suggestion, making the transition less abrupt.",
            "etymology": "「終電」 (shuuden) refers to the last train of the day, a common practical concern in urban Japanese social settings that often dictates the end of social gatherings."

    "post_example_writeup": "The core function of 「ことは〜が」 is to present a concession followed by a contrasting or limiting statement. The specific word repeated before 「ことは」 can be a verb, an i-adjective, a na-adjective, or a noun. The choice between 「が」 and 「けど」 is stylistic; 「が」 is generally more formal or direct, while 「けど」 is softer and more conversational.",

        "violation: Multiple example sentences in the prior version were in dialogue format (A: ... B: ...). The prompt states: 'If the input examples contain dialogue (A: ... B: ...), rewrite them into single-sentence statements that preserve the lesson but remove direct dialogue format.' (Rule 9). Converted examples 5, 6, and 7 from dialogue to single statements.",

        "violation: The `nuance` field was not consistently detailed and did not always refer to specific Japanese in 「quotes」, particularly regarding speaker/listener gender/age dynamics. The prompt states: 'Nuance must refer to parts of the japanese sentence in 「quotes」.' (Rule 6). Updated all `nuance` fields for more specific detail and proper quoting of Japanese phrases.",
        "violation: The prior examples did not fulfill the requirement for a 'first-date' setting example. The prompt states: 'There should always be at least one first-date sentence. This teaches the learner to date.' (Rule 8). Added a new example specifically for a first-date setting.",
        "violation: The flirty example's `nuance` did not explicitly mention the specific Japanese part associated with the speaker's gender, as required by rule 6 ('If there is a \"speaker_gender\", then \"nuance\" must mention the specific Japanese, in 「quotes」, that would only be spoken by that gender.'). Updated the `nuance` for the flirty example to link the male speaker's nuance to the directness of 「好きだ」 and the overall tone."
