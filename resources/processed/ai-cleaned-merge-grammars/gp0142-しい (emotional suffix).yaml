formation:
  i-Adjectives ending in しい: Indicates an inherent strong emotional or sentimental quality. These adjectives
    are not formed by adding しい to other words, but rather are part of the lexicon with this ending. Examples
    include 懐かしい (natsukashii), 恋しい (koishii), 嬉しい (ureshii), 悲しい (kanashii), 美しい (utsukushii).
jlpt: N2
etymology: The 'しい' ending in Japanese adjectives has roots in classical Japanese, where it often denoted
  an intense or deeply felt emotional state. It evolved from older forms and can be linked to the classical
  emotional particle 'し' (shi), which was used to express personal sentiment or reflection. Over time,
  it became an integral and non-separable part of many modern i-adjectives that convey strong subjective
  feelings, rather than a productive suffix to be freely attached to any adjective.
writeup: |-
  The 'しい' ending is not a productive suffix in modern Japanese, meaning you cannot freely attach it to any adjective or verb stem to create new words. Instead, it is a characteristic ending for a significant group of i-adjectives that inherently convey strong, often deeply personal, emotions or sentiments. These adjectives are part of the lexicon and include words like 懐かしい (natsukashii - nostalgic, dearly remembered), 恋しい (koishii - longed for, yearned for), 嬉しい (ureshii - happy, glad), 悲しい (kanashii - sad), and 美しい (utsukushii - beautiful). The presence of 'しい' in these words serves to emphasize the profoundness or intensity of the emotion or state being described.

  While the primary function of adjectives ending in 'しい' is to describe qualities, this specific ending imbues them with an added layer of emotional depth. For instance, while other adjectives might describe a state, words like 恋しい inherently carry a strong sense of longing that is distinct. This nuance can make expressions feel more poignant or heartfelt.

  It is often associated with female speech, lending a softer or more endearing tone to expressions of strong emotion. However, it is not exclusively used by women and can appear in various contexts to convey a heightened emotional register.
false_friends:
  - term: なあ
    meaning: expresses strong emotion, often seeking agreement or confirmation.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both add emotional emphasis, adjectives ending in 「しい」 often convey a softer, more personal,
      and sometimes slightly nostalgic or longing sentiment. 「なあ」 is a more general, direct emotional
      exclamation that can be used by anyone.
    grammar_point: なあ (emotional emphasis)
  - term: 〜てたまらない
    meaning: Cannot bear something; extremely.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜てたまらない」 expresses an unbearable or irresistible degree of feeling, often implying a negative
      or overwhelming sensation that cannot be controlled. Adjectives ending in 「しい」 simply describe the
      intensity of the emotion, which can be positive or negative, without implying lack of control.
    grammar_point: てならない (cannot help but feel)
  - term: 堪らない
    meaning: unbearable・irresistible
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「堪らない」 conveys an overwhelming emotion that is difficult to endure. Adjectives ending in 「しい」,
      by contrast, focus on the inherent emotional quality of the subject, without necessarily implying
      a struggle against an uncontrollable feeling.
    grammar_point: 堪らない (unbearable・irresistible)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the subtle differences between adjectives ending in 'しい' and
  other expressions of strong emotion is key. While expressions like 'なあ' add a general emotional tone
  and '〜てたまらない' or '堪らない' describe an emotion's overwhelming nature, the 'しい' ending is ingrained in the
  adjective itself, defining the inherent emotional character of the word rather than a speaker's reaction
  to it.

  depth of feeling, differentiating them from more neutral descriptions.
