jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: suffix
  function: Intensifies the feeling or emotion associated with the base adjective.
  nuance: Implies a subjective or deeply felt experience, often related to human emotions or senses.
  grammatical-role: suffix
  logical-flow: modifies meaning
etymology: The precise etymology of the suffix 「しい」 is not entirely settled among linguists, but it is
  widely understood to have developed as an intensifier for adjectives, particularly those conveying emotional
  states or subjective sensations. It is often traced back to the Classical Japanese adjectival suffix
  -し (-shi), which carried a similar function of imparting an emotional or descriptive quality. This historical
  usage reinforces its role in emphasizing deeply felt experiences rather than objective properties.
writeup: The suffix 「しい」 attaches to the stem of an i-adjective to convey a strong, deeply felt emotion
  or subjective sensation. Unlike objective descriptive adjectives such as 「赤い (akai)」(red) or 「大きい (ookii)」(big)
  which describe measurable qualities, 「しい」 is characteristically used with adjectives that express internal
  states or feelings. This emphasis on subjective experience makes it commonly appear in words like 「悲しい
  (kanashii)」(sad) or 「嬉しい (ureshii)」(happy), where the feeling is personal and profound rather than externally
  quantifiable. This suffix is often found in adjectives relating to human emotions and senses, highlighting
  the speaker's internal state or perception rather than an external, measurable quality.

post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between adjectives ending in 「しい」 and other expressions,
  remember that 「しい」 often conveys a strong, subjective emotional state or a deeply felt quality. While
  other words like 「幸せ」 or 「怖い」 might overlap in general meaning, the 「しい」 forms typically emphasize the
  personal, internal experience. Similarly, expressions like 「～そう」 describe outward appearances, contrasting
  with the inherent subjective nature emphasized by 「しい」. Also, while 「愉快」 describes a pleasant feeling,
  「楽しい」 focuses on the active enjoyment of an experience.

  a strong, subjective emotional state or a deeply felt quality. They are often used to describe internal
  experiences rather than objective facts. Pay close attention to the specific nuance each 「しい」 adjective
  carries, as they can differ significantly from similar-sounding words or more general expressions.
