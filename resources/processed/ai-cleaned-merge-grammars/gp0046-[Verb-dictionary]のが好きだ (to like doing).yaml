pronunciation:
  katakana: ノ ガ スキ ダ
  romaji: no ga suki da
formation:
  Verb[dictionary form] + の + が + 好きだ: Expresses liking an action or activity.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The particle の in this construction originates from its broader function as a nominalizer,
  transforming a verb phrase into a noun-like entity. This allows the action to be treated as a direct
  object or subject of liking, similar to how a noun would be. The concept of 'liking' (好き) itself is
  rooted in the verb 好く (suku), meaning 'to like' or 'to love'. Thus, 'Verb + の が 好き だ' literally conveys
  'the act of doing [Verb] is liked'. This evolution from a possessive-like particle to a nominalizer
  is a key aspect of how Japanese constructs complex noun phrases.
writeup: |-
  This grammar point, Verb[dictionary form] + の + が + 好きだ, is used to express that someone likes to perform a certain action or activity. The particle の here acts as a nominalizer, transforming the verb phrase that precedes it into a noun. This newly formed noun-like phrase then becomes the subject of the liking, marked by the particle が, followed by 好きだ (to like).

  It is crucial to understand that の in this construction is not the possessive の. Instead, it converts a verb or a verb phrase into a noun equivalent, allowing it to be treated grammatically as an object of affection or preference. For example, 読む (yomu - to read) becomes 読む の (yomu no - the act of reading). Then, 読む の が 好き だ means "I like the act of reading" or simply "I like reading."

  This structure is versatile and can be used with various verbs to express hobbies, preferences, or general enjoyment of activities. While 好きだ is a な-adjective, it functions similar to an adjective that modifies a noun (the nominalized verb phrase).
false_friends:
  - term: '[Noun]が好きだ'
    meaning: To like a noun (thing, person, place)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This expression is used for liking concrete nouns, while Verb[dictionary]のが好きだ is specifically
      for liking actions or activities. For instance, 猫 が 好き だ means "I like cats," but 猫 を 撫でる の が 好き
      だ means "I like petting cats."
    grammar_point: '[Noun]が好きだ (to like)'
  - term: Verb[たい]
    meaning: To want to do (something)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While both express desire related to an action, Verb[dictionary]のが好きだ indicates a preference
      or enjoyment of an activity (e.g., "I like playing tennis"), whereas Verb[たい] expresses a wish or
      desire to perform an action at a specific moment or in the future (e.g., "I want to play tennis
      now"). You might like playing tennis (好きだ), but not want to play it right now (〜たくない).
    grammar_point: Verb[たい] (desiderative)
  - term: '[Verb-dictionary]のが嫌いだ'
    meaning: To dislike doing (something)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: This is the direct opposite. It uses 嫌いだ (to dislike) instead of 好きだ. The structure with の
      nominalizing the verb is identical.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]のが嫌いだ (to dislike doing)'
  - term: '[Verb-dictionary]ことが好きだ'
    meaning: To like doing (something)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is very similar in meaning and usage. の is generally preferred for informal, everyday
      conversations and for concrete activities. こと is slightly more formal, can be used for abstract
      concepts, and is often used in writing or more formal speech.
    grammar_point: <strongly-suggest>:[Verb-dictionary]ことが好きだ (to like doing)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'When expressing a preference for actions, Japanese uses a nominalizer, either
  の or こと, before が 好き だ. While both Verb[dictionary]の が 好き だ and Verb[dictionary]こと が 好き だ convey a liking
  for an action, の tends to be more common in casual, spoken Japanese and for describing more concrete
  or sensory actions (like "eating" or "listening"). こと often carries a slightly more formal nuance and
  a slightly broader usage, including abstract actions or concepts. Remember to differentiate 〜の が 好き
  だ (liking an action) from 〜たい (wanting to perform an action), as the former is a general preference
  while the latter is a current desire. Finally, ensure you use the correct particle: が is used with 好き
  だ to mark the thing or action that is liked.'
examples:
  - english: I like reading books.
    japanese:
      - 私 は 本 を {読む の が 好き だ}。
      - 本 を {読む の が 好き です}。
      - 本 を {読書 する の が 好き です}。
    english_literally: As for me, the act of reading books is liked.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 本 を 読み たい です。
        english: I want to read books.
        hint: 「〜たい」 expresses a desire to do something at a specific moment. We're looking for a general
          preference for an activity.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 本 が 好き です。
        english: I like books.
        hint: This phrase expresses a liking for the noun 'books' itself, not the action of 'reading books'.
          We're looking for liking an action.
    scene: A student casually talks about their hobby to a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The sentence uses 私 は to introduce the speaker, followed by the action 本 を 読む (to read books)
      nominalized by の. 好き だ expresses a general liking. だ indicates casual speech, typical between friends.
      The variation using です provides a polite option, while 読書 する (to do reading) is a slightly more
      formal way to express the same action.
  - english: He likes playing soccer.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は サッカー を {する の が 好き です}。
      - 彼 は サッカー {する の が 好き だ}。
      - 彼 は サッカー を {やる の が 好き だ}。
    english_literally: As for him, the act of playing soccer is liked.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は サッカー を し たい です。
        english: He wants to play soccer.
        hint: This indicates a specific desire, not a general liking for the activity. We're looking for
          a general preference.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は サッカー が 好き です。
        english: He likes soccer.
        hint: This expresses a liking for 'soccer' as a sport or object, not the action of 'playing soccer'.
          We're looking for liking an action.
    scene: Someone is talking about a third person's hobby in a polite setting, perhaps at a gathering.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: Uses です for politeness. する (to do/play) is nominalized. This is a neutral, informative statement
      about someone's preference. The casual だ form and the use of やる (a more casual verb for 'to do')
      are variations commonly heard in informal speech.
  - english: Do you like cooking?
    japanese:
      - 料理 を {する の が 好き です か}。
      - 料理 {する の 好き}？
    english_literally: The act of cooking is liked?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 料理 を し たい です か。
        english: Do you want to cook?
        hint: This asks about a current desire to cook, not a general liking for the activity. We're looking
          for a general preference.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 料理 が 好き です か。
        english: Do you like the food (dish) called 'ryouri' / Do you like the concept of cooking?
        hint: This could mean 'do you like the dish (food) called ryouri?' or 'do you like the concept
          of cooking?', not specifically 'do you like doing cooking?'. We're looking for liking the action.
    scene: You are asking a new acquaintance about their preferences during a casual conversation.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: interrogative
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: Adding か at the end makes it a question. No explicit subject like あなた は is needed in Japanese
      when clear from context. The polite form です か is suitable for new acquaintances. The very casual
      好き？ omits です and か, common in close conversations.
  - english: I don't like waiting for people.
    japanese:
      - 私 は 人 を {待つ の が 好き じゃ ない}。
      - 人 を {待つ の は 好き じゃ あり ませ ん}。
      - 人 を {待つ の は 好き で は あり ませ ん}。
    english_literally: As for me, the act of waiting for people is not liked.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 人 を 待ち たく ない です。
        english: I don't want to wait for people.
        hint: This expresses a current lack of desire to wait, not a general dislike for the act of waiting.
          We're looking for a general preference.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 人 を 待つ の が 嫌い です。
        english: I dislike waiting for people.
        hint: This uses 「嫌い」, which is a direct antonym meaning 'dislike'. While close, the grammar point
          focuses on the negative form of 'like'. We're looking for the negative form of 'to like'.
    scene: Someone expressing a mild annoyance or a personal pet peeve to a close friend.
    register: casual
    setting: casual slang
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: Uses 好き じゃ ない (suki ja nai), the casual negative of 好き だ. 待つ の が nominalizes the action of
      waiting. This casual negative form is appropriate for expressing personal feelings among peers.
      The variations using 好き じゃ ありません and 好き では ありません provide polite and more formal negative options.
  - english: My mother likes gardening.
    japanese:
      - 母 は 庭仕事 を {する の が 好き です}。
      - 母 は 庭仕事 {する の が 好き だ}。

        english: My mother likes gardening (the concept/activity itself).
        hint: This expresses a liking for 'gardening' as a general concept or hobby. While very similar,
          the grammar point specifically nominalizes the verb 'to do gardening'. We're looking for liking
          an action.
    scene: A child is politely talking about their mother's hobby to an adult family friend.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: The subject is 母 (haha - mother), and the sentence uses the polite です. 庭仕事 を する (to do gardening)
      is the nominalized action. This phrasing is common when referring to a family member in a polite
      context. The casual だ form is used when speaking more informally about one's mother.
  - english: I like listening to classical music in the morning.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は クラシック 音楽 が 好き です。
        english: I like classical music.
        hint: This expresses a liking for 'classical music' as a genre, not the action of 'listening to
          classical music'. We're looking for liking an action.
    scene: Someone sharing their daily routine preference with a colleague during a coffee break.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: The nominalized phrase can include adverbs and objects, 朝 に クラシック 音楽 を 聞く (to listen to classical
      music in the morning). The use of です makes the statement polite and suitable for general conversation.
      The casual だ form is suitable for closer relationships or informal settings.
  - english: My younger brother loves playing video games.
    japanese:
      - 弟 は テレビ ゲーム を {する の が 大好き だ}。

          - 弟 は テレビ ゲーム が 大好き です。

    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 大好き だ (daisuki da) expresses a stronger liking ('love') compared to 好き だ. 弟 は (otouto wa -
      younger brother) is the subject. The casual だ ending is common when speaking about family members
      to peers. Using やる adds a more casual tone, while the です form is suitable for polite, general conversation.
  - english: I used to like drawing pictures.
    japanese:
      - 昔、絵 を {描く の が 好き だっ た}。
      - 昔、絵 を {描く の が 好き でし た}。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昔、絵 を 描き たかっ た です。
        english: In the past, I wanted to draw pictures.
        hint: This expresses a past desire, not a past general liking for the activity. We're looking
          for a past general preference.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昔、絵 を 描い て い まし た。
        english: In the past, I was drawing pictures (or used to draw pictures).
        hint: This describes a past action or habit itself, not the liking of that action. We're looking
          for a past liking for an action.
    scene: Someone reminiscing about a past hobby that they no longer pursue.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: 好き だっ た (suki datta) is the casual past tense of 好き だ. 昔 (mukashi) means 'in the past', setting
      the temporal context for the past preference. The 好き でし た form is the polite past tense, suitable
      for more formal or respectful reflection.
  - english: Every day, he likes to walk his dog in the park.
    japanese:

      - 彼 は 毎日、公園 で 犬 を {散歩 さ せる の が 好き だ}。
    english_literally: As for him, the act of making the dog walk in the park every day is liked.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 毎日、公園 で 犬 を 散歩 さ せ たい です。
        english: He wants to walk his dog in the park every day.
        hint: This expresses a current desire to walk the dog, not a general liking for the activity.
          We're looking for a general preference.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 毎日、公園 で 犬 を 散歩 さ せ て い ます。
        english: He walks his dog in the park every day.
        hint: This describes a regular action, not that he enjoys or likes doing it. We're looking for
          liking an action.
    scene: Describing a neighbor's regular enjoyable activity to another neighbor.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: 毎日、公園 で 犬 を 散歩 させる (to walk the dog in the park every day) is the nominalized action. 散歩 させる
      is the causative form, meaning 'to make the dog walk/take the dog for a walk'. This is a polite
      description of a habitual preference. The casual だ form offers a more informal way to state the
      same.
  - english: I like to eat sushi.
    japanese:
      - 私 は 寿司 を {食べる の が 好き です}。
      - 寿司 を {食べる の が 好き だ}。
    english_literally: As for me, the act of eating sushi is liked.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 寿司 を 食べ たい です。
        english: I want to eat sushi.
        hint: 「〜たい」 expresses a desire to do something now or soon. We're looking for a general preference
          for an activity.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 寿司 が 好き です。
        english: I like sushi.
        hint: This expresses a liking for 'sushi' as a food item, not the action of 'eating sushi'. We're
          looking for liking an action.
    scene: A person is asked about their food preferences at a restaurant with friends or colleagues.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: This sentence expresses a general liking for the activity of eating sushi. The 食べる の が 好き
      です indicates a general preference rather than a specific craving. The casual だ form is appropriate
      for informal contexts.
post_example_writeup: Understanding the distinction between a general liking for an action (〜の が 好き だ)
  and a present desire to perform an action (〜たい) is key to mastering Japanese expression of preference.
  Pay close attention to the nominalizing particle の and the particle が that marks the nominalized verb
  phrase as the subject of 好き だ. Consistent practice with various verbs will help solidify this fundamental
  structure.
