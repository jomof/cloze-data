    "writeup": "The grammar point 「になると」 (ni naru to) is used to express that **when a certain time or condition is reached, a specific event or state occurs**. It is often used to describe natural phenomena, habitual actions, or changes in someone's behavior or feelings depending on the topic. The 「に」 indicates the point in time or the condition that triggers the subsequent event. 「なると」 is the dictionary form of the verb 「なる」 (to become) conjugated with 「と」 (to) to mean \"when [something] becomes\".",
