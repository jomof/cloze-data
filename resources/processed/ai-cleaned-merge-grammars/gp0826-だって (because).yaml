    "etymology": "だって is a colloquial contraction of だとて (da to te), where だ is the plain form of the copula です (desu), and とて (tote) is an adverbial particle meaning \"even if\" or \"even though.\" Over time, だとて simplified to だって, retaining its function of introducing a reason or explanation.",
    "writeup": "だって is a versatile expression primarily used in casual conversation. It combines だ (the copula) with the adverbial particle とて. Its main function is to introduce a reason or explanation, often with a hint of displeasure or defensiveness. Think of it as a more emphatic \"because.\" When used at the beginning of a sentence, it prefaces an explanation or counterpoint, similar to でも (demo).\n\nAt the end of a sentence with なんだって (nan datte) or んだって (n datte), it conveys hearsay, like \"I heard that...\" It's considered more casual and can sound a bit childish, especially when followed by もん (mon) or もの (mono). This usage is more common among women and children. It's essential to be mindful of the context to accurately interpret its meaning.",
