    "etymology": "だって is a colloquial contraction of だとて (da to te), where だ (da) is the copula and とて (to te) is an adverbial particle derived from と (to) and て (te). とて implies a premise or reason, similar to と言っても (to itte mo) or と思って (to omotte).",
    "writeup": "だって is a versatile colloquial expression that functions as a conjunction or sentence-ending particle. It is derived from だとて, but this longer form is rarely used. Its primary function is to provide a reason or explanation for a previous statement, often with a hint of displeasure, excuse, or childishness. It can also express hearsay or add emphasis.\n\n*   As a **conjunction** at the beginning of a sentence, it's similar to \"but\" or \"because,\" often followed by a 「もん」 or 「もの」 to soften the tone. It is frequently used by women and children to express an opinion or feeling.\n*   As a **sentence-ending particle**, it conveys \"I heard that\" or \"it is said that,\" similar to 〜そうだ or 〜とのことだ. In this usage, it's often preceded by なんだって.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   The nuance of childishness or naivety makes it less suitable for formal or professional settings.\n*   When used to express hearsay, だって is less formal than other expressions like 〜とのことだ.",
