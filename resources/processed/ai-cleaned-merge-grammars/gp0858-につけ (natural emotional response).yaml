jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used in formal or stiff contexts, often found in literature or when emphasizing an older
    style of expression.
  function: Indicates that a certain thought or feeling is naturally elicited whenever a particular event
    or situation occurs.
  nuance: Highlights a natural, almost automatic, emotional or cognitive response to a recurring event,
    implying a deeper, often introspective, connection between the trigger and the reaction.
  temporal-flow: Indicates a recurring action or state and the subsequent natural emotional or cognitive
    response. It emphasizes the consistent and often profound connection between the two, typically showing
    a cause-and-effect relationship where the effect is an internal feeling or thought.
etymology: This grammar point comes from 「に」 (a particle indicating cause or reason) and 「つけ」, the conjunctive
  form of the verb 「付ける」 (tsukeru, to attach). It literally means 'attached to' or 'in connection with'.
  The nuance is that a certain feeling or thought is naturally *attached* to a particular event or situation.
writeup: 「につけ」 implies that there is something 'affixed' to the event or occasion. This structure combines
  the particle 「に」 with the conjunctive form of the verb 「付ける」, meaning 'to affix' or 'to adhere'. When
  using 「につけ」, the most common translation is that something happens 'every (A)', or 'whenever (A)'. The
  second part of the sentence (B) often expresses the speaker's thoughts or feelings that arise in relation
  to (A). This (B) part is typically something that is understood to happen naturally due to (A). This
  structure can be used with either verbs or nouns in their dictionary forms. It is also possible to see
  the longer form 「につけて」, but the abbreviated form 「につけ」 is far more common, especially in contemporary
  use, though the entire phrase is considered somewhat old-fashioned overall. **Important Considerations:**
  * 「につけ」 is considered a fairly old-fashioned grammar structure. It is primarily encountered in literature,
  essays, or historical dramas, rather than common everyday conversation. * It often describes a deep,
  often emotional, reaction or realization that occurs consistently with a recurring event. * The grammatical
  pattern often involves expressions of thought or feeling in the latter part of the sentence, such as
  「思い出す」 (to recall), 「感じる」 (to feel), 「考える」 (to think), or internal reactions like sadness or relief.

  - term: ごとに
    meaning: Each; Every
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「につけ」 connects an event with a thought or feeling, emphasizing a natural, internal reaction,
      「ごとに」 simply indicates frequency or distribution, focusing on objective repetition.
    grammar_point: ごとに (each・every)
  - term: おきに
    meaning: Repeated at intervals; Every other; Every; At intervals of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「につけ」, which implies a more emotional or reflective connection, 「おきに」 specifies regular,
      fixed intervals or patterns of repetition, such as 'every two days' or 'every third seat'.
    grammar_point: おきに (at intervals of)
  - term: たびに
    meaning: Each time; Every time; Whenever
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たびに」 is a more common and versatile synonym for 'whenever' or 'every time'. While it can
      often be used interchangeably with 「につけ」, it typically lacks the nuance of a deep, natural, or introspective
      emotional/cognitive association that 「につけ」 often carries.
    grammar_point: たびに (each time)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「ごとに」, 「おきに」, and 「たびに」 can sometimes convey a similar sense of repetition
  to 「につけ」, it's crucial to understand their distinct nuances. 「につけ」 carries a stronger implication of
  a natural, almost involuntary, emotional or cognitive connection between the event and the resulting
  feeling or thought. 「たびに」 is generally a more common and versatile choice for simply stating 'every
  time' something happens. 「ごとに」 focuses on the distribution or frequency (e.g., 'every day', 'every 30
  minutes'), while 「おきに」 emphasizes repetition at specific, often spaced, intervals (e.g., 'every other
  day'). Choose 「につけ」 when the emotional or reflective link to the recurring event is paramount.
examples:
  - english: Whenever I look at old family photos, I long for my hometown.
    japanese:
      - 古い 家族 写真 を 見る {につけ}、故郷 を 恋しく 思い ます。
      - 古い 家族 写真 を 見る {につけ}、故郷 が 懐かしく なり ます。
      - 古い 家族 写真 を 見る {につけ}、故郷 を 恋しく 思う。
    english_literally: To look at old family photos, every time, I think longingly of my hometown.

          - 古い 家族 写真 を 見る たび に、故郷 を 恋しく 思い ます。
        english: Every time I look at old family photos, I long for my hometown.
        hint: While 「たびに」 also means 'every time', 「につけ」 carries a deeper nuance of a natural, often emotional,
          reaction linked to the recurring event. We're looking for that deeper, almost automatic response.
    scene: You're at your city apartment, surrounded by the hustle and bustle. You open an old photo album
      and flip through pages, seeing images of your childhood home and family gatherings in the countryside.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The use of 「故郷を 恋しく 思います」 expresses a profound sense of longing for one's hometown, a common
      emotional response evoked by this grammar point. The alternative 「故郷が 懐かしく なります」 also conveys a
      deep, natural emotional response of nostalgia for one's hometown.
    etymology: 'The word 「故郷」 (kokyō) refers to one''s hometown or birthplace, often carrying a strong
      sense of nostalgia or longing. 「恋しい」 (koishii) means to miss or long for something. The combination
      reflects a deep emotional connection to one''s roots. '
  - english: Every time I listen to this music, my faint love from that time revives.
    japanese:
      - この 音楽 を 聞く {につけ}、あの 頃 の 淡い 恋 が 蘇り ます。
      - この 音楽 を 聞く {につけ}、あの 頃 の 淡い 恋 が よみがえる。
    english_literally: To hear this music, every time, that time's faint love revives.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 音楽 を 聞く たび に、あの 頃 の 淡い 恋 が 蘇り ます。
        english: Every time I listen to this music, my faint love from that time revives.
        hint: 「たびに」 simply states frequency. 「につけ」 implies a more profound, almost inevitable emotional
          resurfacing that connects the music to the past love. We need that stronger connection.
    scene: A person is walking down the street, and a familiar melody drifts from a cafe. It's a song
      they used to listen to with someone special long ago, and suddenly, memories and feelings resurface.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: 「淡い 恋が 蘇ります」 conveys a poetic and somewhat wistful resurgence of past feelings, typical of
      the introspective nuance of 「につけ」. The casual 「よみがえる」 also maintains this emotional resurgence.
    etymology: '「淡い」 (awai) means faint, light, or subtle. When paired with 「恋」 (koi), it suggests a budding,
      fragile, or unrequited love, often carrying a sense of wistfulness. 「蘇る」 (yomigaeru) means to be
      resurrected or revived, giving a dramatic sense to the return of feelings. '
  - english: Whenever I reflect on my New Year's resolutions, and whenever I regret past failures, I swore
      in my heart that I would do my best this year.
    japanese:
      - 新年 の 抱負 を 考える {につけ}、過去 の 失敗 を 悔いる {につけ}、今年 は 頑張ろう と 心 に 誓い まし た。
      - 新年 の 抱負 を 考える {につけ}、過去 の 失敗 を 悔やむ {につけ}、今年 は 頑張ろう と 心 に 誓っ た。

      swore in my heart I would do my best.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 新年 の 抱負 を 考える ごと に、過去 の 失敗 を 悔いる ごと に、今年 は 頑張ろう と 心 に 誓い まし た。
        english: Each time I reflect on my New Year's resolutions, and each time I regret past failures,
          I swore in my heart that I would do my best this year.
        hint: 「ごとに」 emphasizes each instance without the emotional resonance of 「につけ」. Here, the repeated
          reflection and regret lead to a deep internal vow, which is best captured by 「につけ」.
    scene: It's the end of December. You're sitting alone, jotting down goals for the new year. As you
      write, memories of previous years' unfulfilled promises and past mistakes come to mind, solidifying
      your determination for the upcoming year.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The repetitive use of 「につけ」 with two distinct actions (thinking about resolutions and regretting
      failures) highlights a comprehensive introspective process leading to a firm resolve, 「心に 誓いました」.
      The casual 「悔やむ」 and 「誓った」 maintain the earnest internal reflection.
    etymology: '「抱負」 (hōfu) refers to a resolution or aspiration, often for the new year. 「悔いる」 (kuiru)
      or 「悔やむ」 (kuyamu) means to regret or repent, often with a sense of self-reproach. 「心に 誓う」 (kokoro
      ni chikau) means to vow in one''s heart, implying a strong, personal commitment. '

          - 彼女 は 何 か あれ ば、周り の 人 に 優しく 接し ます。
        english: She treats the people around her kindly if anything happens.
        hint: 「何かに つけ」 implies a consistent kindness that manifests with *any* small incident or trigger,
          showing an inherent character trait. 「何 か あれば」 suggests kindness only when a specific situation
          arises, not constantly.
    scene: You're observing a new colleague at work. You notice that whether it's a small mistake by someone
      else or a difficult task she's given, her demeanor remains consistently kind and helpful towards
      others.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「何かに つけ」 here describes an inherent character trait where kindness is consistently displayed,
      irrespective of the situation, showing a deep-seated disposition rather than just an occasional
      reaction. The use of 「優しい」 also highlights this intrinsic quality.
    etymology: 'The idiom 「何かに つけ」 implies that no matter the triviality or significance of an event,
      a certain action or feeling is consistently present. It shows an inherent trait rather than a conditional
      response. '
  - english: Whenever I face difficulties, I recall my teacher's words.
    japanese:

      - 困難 に 直面 する {につけ}、先生 の 言葉 を 思い出し ます。
      - 困難 に 直面 する {につけ}、先生 の 言葉 を 思い出す。

          - 困難 に 直面 する とき、先生 の 言葉 を 思い出し ます。
        english: When I face difficulties, I recall my teacher's words.
        hint: While 「とき」 indicates 'when' something happens, 「につけ」 emphasizes that recalling the words
          is a natural, almost automatic response that is deeply linked to the difficulties, implying
          a more profound connection than just a simple temporal relation.
    scene: A young professional is working on a challenging project. They encounter a significant roadblock,
      and at that moment, they instinctively remember a piece of advice their mentor once gave them.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The longer form 「につけて」 and its more common counterpart 「につけ」 carry the core meaning of a natural,
      recurring emotional or cognitive connection. 「先生の 言葉を 思い出します」 highlights the mentor's lasting impact,
      implying the words become a fundamental part of coping.
    etymology: '「直面する」 (chokumen suru) means to confront or face directly, often used for challenges or
      difficulties. The phrase implies an inevitable encounter with hardship. '
  - english: Every time I encounter his awkward kindness, I find myself increasingly drawn to him.

        english: Every time I encounter his awkward kindness, I find myself increasingly drawn to him.
        hint: 「たびに」 expresses simple repetition, but 「につけ」 conveys that his kindness *naturally* and *consistently*
          evokes a growing attraction, highlighting the emotional depth and connection between the two.
    scene: A woman is getting to know a man who is not overtly smooth or charming, but she notices small,
      genuine acts of kindness from him. Each time she sees this, she feels her affection for him grow.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「不器用な 優しさ」 (awkward kindness) describes a unique charm. 「ますます 彼に 惹かれて いきます」 shows a growing,
      deep affection, indicating a strong emotional connection to the grammar point's nuance. The casual
      「惹かれていく」 conveys the same developing affection.
    etymology: '「不器用な 優しさ」 (bukiyōna yasashisa) is an expression that literally translates to ''clumsy
      kindness''. It often implies a kindness that is genuine and heartfelt, perhaps not smooth or outwardly
      refined, but deeply sincere and thus more impactful. 「惹かれる」 (hikareru) means to be attracted or
      drawn to someone. '

          - 美しい 夕焼け を 見る たび に、深く 感動 し ます。
        english: Every time I see a beautiful sunset, I am deeply moved.
        hint: While 「たびに」 indicates simple repetition of an event, 「につけ」 implies that seeing the sunset
          naturally and consistently brings about a profound emotional response of being deeply moved.
          We are looking for that inherent, almost automatic connection.
    scene: You are standing on a balcony overlooking the ocean, painting the sky with vibrant colors.
      The beauty of the scene fills you with a sense of awe.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The use of 「感動します」 conveys a strong emotional reaction, emphasizing the deep impact the recurring
      event (seeing a beautiful sunset) has on the speaker's feelings, which is characteristic of 「につけ」.
      The casual 「感動する」 similarly conveys a natural emotional response.
    etymology: '「夕焼け」 (yūyake) specifically refers to the red glow of the sunset, distinct from just ''sunset''.
      「感動する」 (kandō suru) means to be deeply moved or impressed, often implying a powerful emotional impact. '

        english: Every time I hear children's laughter, I feel a sense of peace.
        hint: 「たびに」 merely states that the event and feeling occur together. 「につけ」 expresses that the
          sound of children's laughter naturally and reliably brings about a feeling of peace, suggesting
          an intrinsic emotional connection.
    scene: After a busy day, you are walking through a park. You hear the joyful shouts and laughter of
      children playing nearby. The sound immediately brings a calming effect.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: optimistic
    nuance: 「心が 安らぎます」 describes a profound sense of inner calm. The use of 「につけ」 highlights that this
      feeling is a natural, almost inevitable emotional outcome whenever the specific trigger (children's
      laughter) occurs, demonstrating a deep-seated reaction.
    etymology: 'The phrase 「心が安らぐ」 suggests a calming of the mind or spirit, a state of tranquility. 「笑い声」
      (waraigoe) refers to the sound of laughter. '

        english: Even in times of joy or times of sorrow, she always keeps her composure.
        hint: While 「～の時でも」 conveys 'even in times of', 「につけ」 emphasizes that her composure is consistently
          maintained *regardless* of whether the situation involves joy or sorrow, highlighting a stable
          character trait rather than just two distinct conditions.
    scene: You are observing a friend who has a remarkable ability to remain balanced. You've seen her
      celebrate great successes and face tough personal setbacks, yet her demeanor remains consistently
      calm.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 'This example uses the 「A につけ B につけ」 formation to illustrate a consistent personality trait:
      her composure is naturally present in both joyful and sorrowful situations. This highlights the
      inherent and unwavering nature of her calmness, regardless of the emotional context.'
    etymology: 'The expression 「喜び」 (joy) and 「悲しみ」 (sorrow) are fundamental human emotions. Paired with
      「につけ」, they convey universality in behavior. 「落ち着く」 (ochitsuku) means to calm down, settle down,
      or be composed. '

        english: When I hear his name, I remember the old days.
        hint: While 「～と」 can imply 'when', 「につけ」 conveys that hearing his name naturally and consistently

          than just a conditional occurrence.

      a flood of memories from a bygone era comes to your mind.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「昔の ことを 思い出します」 indicates a natural, recurring memory. The use of 「につけ」 conveys that the act
      of hearing his name consistently and naturally brings about these recollections, highlighting an
      inherent connection to the past.
    etymology: 'The phrase 「昔のこと」 literally means ''things of the past'', often referring to memories
      or events from long ago. 「思い出す」 (omoidasu) means to recall or remember. '
post_example_writeup: Note the subtle difference between 「につけ」 and 「につけて」. While the latter is grammatically
  correct and sometimes used interchangeably, 「につけ」 is generally more common and concise in its expression.
  Both convey the nuance of a natural and consistent emotional or cognitive response to a recurring trigger.
