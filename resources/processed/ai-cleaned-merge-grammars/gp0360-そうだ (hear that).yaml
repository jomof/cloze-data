    "etymology": "The auxiliary 「そうだ」 for hearsay is believed to have evolved from the verb 「言う (いう)」, meaning \"to say,\" specifically from its conjunctive form 「言う (いう)」 combined with the quotative particle 「と」 and a form of 「ある」 or 「だ」. Over time, this construction streamlined to directly convey reported speech or information heard from an external source, ultimately forming the modern 「そうだ」 that signifies \"I heard that...\" or \"it is said that...\".",
    "writeup": "The auxiliary verb 「そうだ」 holds two primary functions in Japanese: to convey hearsay (伝聞) and to describe appearance (様態). This lesson focuses exclusively on its hearsay function, which is used to report information that has been obtained from other people or sources.\n\nWhen 「そうだ」 is used to convey hearsay, it always attaches to the **plain form** of the preceding word. This structure implies that the speaker is merely relaying information and is not necessarily endorsing its absolute truth or certainty. The attachments are as follows:\n\n*   **Verbs:** Attach directly to the plain form (dictionary, ない, た, なかった forms). For example, 「雨が降るそうだ」(Ame ga furu sou da - I heard it will rain).\n*   **い-Adjectives:** Attach directly to the plain form. For example, 「このケーキは甘いそうだ」(Kono keeki wa amai sou da - I heard this cake is sweet).\n*   **な-Adjectives:** Attach to the plain form with 「だ」. For example, 「彼は親切だそうだ」(Kare wa shinsetsu da sou da - I heard he is kind).\n*   **Nouns:** Attach to the plain form with 「だ」. For example, 「彼女は先生だそうだ」(Kanojo wa sensei da sou da - I heard she is a teacher).\n\nAn important nuance of this 「そうだ」 is that it signals that the speaker is *not 100% certain* about the information's validity. They are simply conveying what they have heard. This makes it a less confident expression than others that convey conjecture or certainty, such as 「ようだ」 or stating a fact directly.\n\n**Distinguishing Hearsay 「そうだ」 from Appearance 「そうだ」:**\nIt is crucial to differentiate this hearsay 「そうだ」 from the 「そうだ」 used to describe appearance (what something *looks like* or *seems like*). The key difference lies in their grammatical attachment patterns:\n\n*   **Verbs:**\n    *   **Hearsay:** 降るそうだ (furu sou da - I heard it will rain.) - Verb in plain form.\n    *   **Appearance:** 降りそうだ (furi sou da - It looks like it will rain.) - Verb stem + そうだ.\n*   **い-Adjectives:**\n    *   **Hearsay:** 寒いそうだ (samui sou da - I heard it's cold.) - い-adjective in plain form.\n    *   **Appearance:** 寒そうだ (samu sou da - It looks cold.) - い-adjective stem (remove い) + そうだ.\n*   **な-Adjectives:**\n    *   **Hearsay:** 綺麗だそうだ (kirei da sou da - I heard it's beautiful.) - な-adjective + だ + そうだ.\n    *   **Appearance:** 綺麗そうだ (kirei sou da - It looks beautiful.) - な-adjective stem (no だ) + そうだ.\n*   **Nouns:**\n    *   **Hearsay:** 医者だそうだ (isha da sou da - I heard they are a doctor.) - Noun + だ + そうだ.\n    *   **Appearance:** Nouns typically do not take the appearance 「そうだ」 directly in this form; other structures like 「～のようだ」 are used for similar meanings.",
