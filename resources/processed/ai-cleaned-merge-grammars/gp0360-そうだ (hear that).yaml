    "writeup": "そうだ is an auxiliary verb with two main functions. This lesson focuses on its use to convey **hearsay** (伝聞), indicating information heard from others. The other function, conveying appearance (様態), will be covered elsewhere.\n\nWhen repeating information, そうだ (or そうです) follows the plain form of a verb or い-adjective, or a noun/な-adjective followed by だ. Importantly, そうだ implies the speaker isn't entirely certain of the information's validity, making it less confident than expressions like ようだ.\n\nTo avoid confusion with そうだ used for observations, remember:\n\n*   **Verbs:** 「降るそうだ」 (I heard it will rain) vs. 「降りそうだ」 (It looks like it will rain).\n*   **い-Adjectives:** 「寒いそうだ」 (I heard it's cold) vs. 「寒そうだ」 (It looks cold).\n*   **Nouns/な-Adjectives:** 「綺麗だそうだ」 (I heard it's pretty) vs. 「綺麗そうだ」 (It looks pretty).",
