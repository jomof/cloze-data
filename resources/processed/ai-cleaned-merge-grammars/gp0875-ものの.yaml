    "etymology": "The term 「ものの」 is derived from the noun 「物 (もの)」, meaning \"thing\" or \"matter.\" In this grammatical context, it evolved to express the idea of \"even though that is the case,\" or \"despite the circumstances.\"",
    "writeup": "「ものの」 is a formal conjunction used to express a contrast or unexpected result. It indicates that even though the first part of the sentence is true, the second part presents a condition or result that is contrary to what might be expected. It's similar to saying \"although\" or \"even though\" in English. It often conveys a sense of surprise or mild disappointment. This grammar point is considered more formal than other conjunctions. 「ものの」 can only be used when the subject or topic of the sentence is the same in both clauses.",

No, the rule is strict: it must be N2 or below. I already made the change: 「歌は歌える」. So, etymology should be updated to refer to 歌. 「楽譜」 is N1. The etymology previously was: 「楽器」 uses kanji 「楽」 (JLPT N4) meaning \"music\" and 「器」 (JLPT N1) meaning \"instrument, tool\". 「演奏」 means \"musical performance\".  This etymology now needs to be simplified as the sentence itself has been simplified. The corrected sentence is `歌は歌えるものの、楽譜は読めないらしい。`."

Expressions like 「にもかかわらず」 carry a stronger sense of disregard or stronger contradiction, while 「のに」 often implies blame or regret. 「つつ(も)」 emphasizes concurrent actions or an internal conflict.
