    "writeup": "**ものの** is a formal conjunction used to express a contrast or concession. It indicates that despite a certain fact or circumstance (A), the expected result or logical consequence (B) does not follow, or is in direct contrast. Think of it as a more formal way of saying \"although\" or \"even though.\" It carries a nuance of unexpectedness or contradiction. **Important:** **ものの** is typically used when the subject of both clauses is the same.\n\n*   It can follow verbs and *i*-adjectives in their plain form.\n*   For *na*-adjectives, it is followed by な.\n*   For nouns, it's followed by である.",
