details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used to express that a situation or outcome will remain unchanged regardless of two opposing
    possibilities or conditions. It conveys a strong sense of determination or indifference.
  function: Conjunctive particle and auxiliary verb combination, indicating concession and emphasizing
    inevitability.
  nuance: This pattern carries a strong, emphatic nuance. It implies that the speaker's will, decision,
    or the situation's outcome is fixed and will not be swayed by the opposing conditions mentioned. It
    is more assertive than simpler concessive forms like 「ても」.
  grammatical-role: Acts as a conjunction, connecting two contrasting clauses where the second clause's
    outcome is independent of the first's conditions.
  logical-flow: Presents two contrasting conditions as irrelevant to the main outcome.
  temporal-flow: Neutral, can refer to present or future situations.
  spatial-flow: Not applicable to spatial flow topics.
etymology: This grammar point is formed by combining the volitional form of a verb (う or よう) with the
  negative volitional form (まい), joined by the particle が. The volitional form, originating from classical
  Japanese, expresses intent or possibility, while まい (a contraction of まい+ある) serves as a negative volitional
  or presumptive. The particle が, functioning concessively, links these two opposing possibilities. Historically,
  the structure reflects a robust expression of indifference to outcomes, implying 'whether it is to be
  so or not to be so, still X.'
writeup: |-
  The structure 「ようが〜まいが」 combines the positive and negative volitional forms of a verb to express that, **regardless of whether something happens or not**, the result will be the same. It is an emphatic way of stating "whether or not (A), (B) will happen." The particle が is used after both the positive and negative forms.

  While this pattern is most commonly used with verbs (e.g., 行こうが 行くまいが), it can also be applied to い-adjectives and な-adjectives/nouns. For い-adjectives, the hypothetical volitional form (かろう) is used, and for な-adjectives and nouns, the auxiliary verb だ conjugates to であろう or だろう. In cases where まい cannot be used (i.e., with adjectives and nouns), an antonym or a contrasting concept is typically paired with the positive volitional form (e.g., 難しかろうが 易しかろうが, 社長であろうが 平社員であろうが). This creates a similar 'whether or not' meaning.

  This grammar pattern often reflects the speaker's strong will, determination, or unwavering opinion that will not change, irrespective of the conditions described. It conveys a sense of certainty about the inevitable outcome or the speaker's resolve.
false_friends:
  - term: 〜ても〜なくても
    meaning: Whether ~ or not
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While similar in meaning, 「〜ても〜なくても」 focuses more on the condition as a general concession,
      whereas 「ようが〜まいが」 emphasizes that the outcome remains the same regardless of a strong, often volitional,
      contrasting condition. 「ようが〜まいが」 carries a more emphatic and determined nuance.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:〜ても〜なくても (whether or not)
  - term: てでも
    meaning: Even if I have to, by any or all means, no matter what
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「てでも」 emphasizes the *effort* one is willing to expend or the extreme measure one might take
      to achieve something. In contrast, 「ようが〜まいが」 focuses on the *result* being unchanged regardless
      of opposing conditions, rather than the effort involved in causing that result.
    grammar_point: てでも (even if I have to)
  - term: とも
    meaning: Even if, no matter
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「とも」 is a broader, more general concessive expression that doesn't inherently require the
      volitional form. 「ようが〜まいが」 specifically highlights two opposing volitional possibilities, making
      it more specific and emphatic about a binary choice or condition.
    grammar_point: とも (even if・no matter)
  - term: ても
    meaning: Even if, even though
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ても」 is a more general expression of concession. 「ようが〜まいが」 is significantly more emphatic
      and specifically contrasts two opposing volitional possibilities, suggesting an unshakeable outcome
      or stance despite either possibility.
    grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
  - term: たって
    meaning: Even if, even though, no matter how
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「たって」 is a more colloquial and emphatic version of 「ても」, often emphasizing the degree or extent
      of something. While it conveys concession, 「ようが〜まいが」 specifically contrasts two opposing possibilities
      (often volitional) and asserts that the outcome is unchanged regardless of which of the two occurs.
    grammar_point: (っ)たって (even if)
  - term: 〜にしろ〜にしろ
    meaning: Whether A or B; Regardless of A or B
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜にしろ〜にしろ」 functions similarly to 「ようが〜まいが」 in presenting two contrasting possibilities with
      the same outcome. However, 「ようが〜まいが」 often implies a stronger, more assertive stance of indifference
      or determination, whereas 「〜にしろ〜にしろ」 can sometimes just state that the conditions are equally irrelevant,
      without necessarily implying the same degree of speaker's resolve.
    grammar_point: にしろ〜にしろ (whether... or...)
post_false_friends_writeup: While several expressions can convey a sense of 'even if' or 'no matter what',
  「ようが〜まいが」 stands out due to its emphatic nature and its specific focus on two contrasting, often volitional,
  possibilities. It asserts that the outcome is fixed, irrespective of either condition. Other forms,
  like 「ても」 or 「てでも」, might highlight general concession or the effort required, but they lack the distinct
  binary emphasis inherent in 「ようが〜まいが」.

        english: Whether I go or not, his attitude probably won't change.
        hint: 「〜ても〜なくても」 is a more general concession, stating that both possibilities lead to the same
          result. 「ようが〜まいが」 emphasizes a stronger, more indifferent, or determined stance that the outcome
          is fixed regardless of the opposing conditions. We're looking for a more emphatic expression
          of indifference.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: Whether I go or not, his attitude probably won't change.
        hint: 「とも」 is a broader concessive. While similar, 「ようが〜まいが」 often carries a stronger, more emphatic
          binary contrast, specifically pairing the positive and negative volitional actions, highlighting
          that the outcome is fixed irrespective of either. We're looking for a more direct pairing of
          opposite volitional choices.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 が 行く に しろ 行か ない に しろ、彼 の 態度 は 変わら ない だろう。
        english: Whether I go or don't go, his attitude probably won't change.
        hint: 「〜にしろ〜にしろ」 states that two conditions are equally irrelevant, but 「ようが〜まいが」 more strongly
          conveys the speaker's indifference or determination against these opposing possibilities. We're
          looking for a stronger emphasis on the speaker's resolved stance.
    scene: A friend is debating attending an event where someone they dislike will be present, expressing
      resignation about the situation.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: female

      or not going) will have no bearing on the other person's behavior, conveying a sense of resignation
      or indifference. The casual register and the use of plain form ending 「変わらないだろう」 are suitable for
      a younger female speaker talking to a male friend.

          for a slightly more emphatic statement of resolve.

          here conveys a stronger, more assertive commitment that won't be swayed by the job's difficulty.
          We're aiming for a slightly more determined nuance.

        hint: While 「〜ても〜ても」 conveys concession, 「ようが〜まいが」 (using 「であろうが」) more strongly emphasizes that

          an unwavering personal conviction.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: Whether he's the company president or a regular employee, I don't trust him.
        hint: 「とも」 is a valid alternative, but 「ようが〜まいが」 gives a slightly stronger emphasis to the speaker's

          decisive expression of distrust.
      - competing_japanese:

        hint: 「〜にしろ〜にしろ」 states that both statuses are irrelevant to the speaker's trust. However, 「ようが〜まいが」
          provides a slightly more emphatic tone, highlighting that the speaker's firm personal conviction
          is unswayed by status. We're emphasizing a strong, personal judgment.
    scene: Someone expressing deep distrust towards a colleague, indicating that their opinion is personal

    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious

    nuance: The phrase 「社長であろう が 平社員であろう が」 emphasizes that the speaker's lack of trust is a fundamental
      personal judgment, completely uninfluenced by the individual's position or title. The plain form
      ending 「信用しない」 is appropriate for a semi-formal setting where an older female speaker expresses
      a firm opinion to a male listener.

        hint: 「〜たって」 (colloquial 「〜ても」) also conveys concession but lacks the specific emphasis of 「何を言おうが」
          on the unyielding nature of her determination. We're looking for a more emphatic statement of
          her resolve.
    scene: Someone discusses a friend's determination and independence in pursuing her dreams despite

        english: Whether I go or don't go is not the problem, I won't regret it.
        hint: This phrasing focuses on the irrelevance of the choice itself. 「ようが〜まいが」 directly states
          that the outcome (no regret) is fixed regardless of the specific action chosen. We're emphasizing
          the unshakeable resolve about the future emotional state.

        hint: 「とも」 is a valid alternative, but 「ようが〜まいが」 here conveys a stronger, more assertive declaration
          of an unyielding standard. We're looking for a slightly more emphatic statement of a core value.
    scene: A manager setting expectations for their team regarding manufacturing standards, emphasizing
      that quality is non-negotiable.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「高かろう が 安かろう が」 emphasizes an absolute commitment to quality that transcends price
      point. This is a directive statement, highlighting that the speaker's priority is fixed regardless
      of cost considerations. The formal and instructional tone fits a female manager addressing her team,
      setting clear, uncompromisable standards.
  - english: No matter what anyone says, I will believe in myself.
    japanese:

          - 誰 が 何 を 言っ て も、私 は 自分 を 信じる。
        english: Even if anyone says anything, I will believe in myself.
        hint: While 「〜ても」 is a general concessive, 「誰が何を言おうが」 specifically highlights an unwavering internal
          resolve against *any* external criticism or doubt, making it more emphatic. We want to express
          a powerful sense of independence and self-affirmation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 誰 が 何 を 言おう と、私 は 自分 を 信じる。
        english: No matter what anyone says, I will believe in myself.
        hint: Both 「誰が何を言おうが」 and 「誰が何を言おうと」 convey a similar meaning. 「ようが」 tends to be slightly more
          emphatic in its assertion that the outcome (self-belief) remains unaffected by any external
          opinion. We're looking for a stronger emphasis on unwavering resolve.
    scene: A young person affirming their self-belief amidst criticism or doubt, expressing a strong,
      independent spirit.
    register: casual
    setting: inspirational
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The phrase 「誰 が 何 を 言おう が」 strongly asserts unwavering self-belief against any external criticism
      or opinion. This indicates a firm, independent stance and personal resilience. The casual register
      and plain form (`信じる`) are typical for a younger speaker expressing personal determination or self-affirmation,
      perhaps to themselves or as a general statement of conviction.
post_example_writeup: 'This grammar pattern effectively conveys a sense of inevitability or strong resolve.
  While the examples above showcase its use with verbs, adjectives, and nouns, the core meaning remains
  consistent: despite any contrasting conditions, the outcome or the speaker''s stance will not change.'
