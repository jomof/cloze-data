details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  particle-pragmatic-function: emphasis
  usage-context: general
etymology: 「も」 is believed to have originated from the verb 「持つ (もつ)」, meaning "to hold" or "to possess."
  Over time, it evolved to express the idea of something being added or included, hence its current meaning
  of "also" or "too."
writeup: |-
  「も」 indicates that something else is also the case, or that a condition applies to an additional item. Its precise translation shifts depending on whether the sentence is affirmative or negative. In English, this often requires different words like "too/also" for affirmative statements, or "neither/either" for negative ones. However, in Japanese, 「も」 serves all these functions.

  Fundamentally, you can interpret 「も」 as conveying the idea: "Whatever is true for (A), is also true for (B)."

  This particle frequently appears in compound grammar structures, such as 「でも」, 「にも〜ない」, and 「とも」. While these combinations subtly shift the overall nuance, the core meaning of 「も」—that of addition or inclusion— remains consistent.

  - term: と (and)
    meaning: And (exhaustive listing)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike 「も」, 「と」 is used to exhaustively list items, often implying that only the listed items
      are relevant, whereas 「も」 implies addition or inclusion of something else, often to an existing
      context without necessarily exhaustively listing.
    grammar_point: と (and, connects nouns)
  - term: は (topic and contrast)
    meaning: As for; Topic marker; Contrastive marker
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike 「も」, 「は」 sets the topic or highlights a contrast, focusing on specific information
      about that topic, but it does not inherently imply addition or inclusion. When used contrastively,
      it highlights what is *not* true for other items, which is opposite to 「も」's additive nature.
    grammar_point: は (topic and contrast)
  - term: だけ (only・just)
    meaning: Only; just
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「だけ」 explicitly limits or restricts the scope to 'only' or 'just' a specified item, excluding
      others. In contrast, 「も」 expands the scope by indicating 'also' or 'even', including additional
      items.
    grammar_point: だけ (only・just)
  - term: さえ (even・if only)
    meaning: Even; if only; as long as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「も」 and 「さえ」 can express 'even', 「さえ」 often implies a surprising or minimal inclusion,
      suggesting that something is true *despite* being an extreme case or *as a minimum condition*. 「も」
      is a broader additive particle, simply indicating 'also' or 'too' without necessarily implying extremity.
    grammar_point: さえ (even・if only)
post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  While 「も」 and 「と」 can both connect elements, their functions differ. 「と」 is typically used for exhaustive or specified lists (e.g., 「りんご と みかん」 for apples and oranges, implying these are the only ones). 「も」, however, is used for addition or inclusion, often meaning 'also' or 'too' (e.g., 「りんご も みかん も」, implying apples and oranges are included, possibly among other things, or that both share a characteristic). This extends to negative contexts, where 「も」 can mean 'neither' or 'not... either'.

  Furthermore, 「も」 contrasts with 「は」. While 「は」 marks the topic or highlights contrast, it doesn't inherently imply addition. For example, 「私 は 学生 です」 simply states a fact about the speaker. If another person shares the same characteristic, you would use 「彼 も 学生 です」 (He is *also* a student). If you used 「彼 は 学生 です」, it would state his profession without linking it to someone's.

  It is also important to distinguish 「も」 from limiting particles like 「だけ」. 「だけ」 expresses exclusion, meaning 'only' or 'just' (e.g., 「水 だけ 飲む」 – 'drink only water'). Conversely, 「も」 expresses inclusion, adding an item or concept to what is already stated.

  Finally, while 「も」 and 「さえ」 both convey 'even', their nuances differ. 「さえ」 often highlights a surprising or minimal case, emphasizing that something holds true *even* for an extreme or bare-minimum example. 「も」 is generally a more neutral additive particle, indicating 'also' or 'too' without necessarily emphasizing the extremity or minimum condition.
