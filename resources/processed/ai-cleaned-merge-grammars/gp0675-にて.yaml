        "Usage": "Primarily used in writing and formal announcements; less common in casual conversation."
    },
    "etymology": "「にて」originated from 「に」 (a particle indicating location, time, etc.) combined with 「て」 (the conjunctive particle). Over time, 「にて」 evolved into a standalone particle with a formal nuance similar to 「で」.",
    "writeup": "「にて」 is a formal particle that functions similarly to 「で」, indicating location, time, means, or method. It is often used in formal writing, announcements, and business settings. While 「で」 is more common in everyday conversation, 「にて」 adds a layer of formality. It emphasizes the noun preceding it, highlighting its role in the sentence. Consider it as a more **stilted and sophisticated** way of saying 「で」. In conversation, you'll sound like a stiff if you use it, so you can safely think of it as used in books, signs, and announcements.",
