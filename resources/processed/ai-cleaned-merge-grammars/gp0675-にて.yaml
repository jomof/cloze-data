    "etymology": "「にて」 originated from 「に」 (a particle indicating location, time, etc.) combined with 「て」 (the conjunctive particle). Over time, 「にて」 evolved into a standalone particle with a formal nuance similar to 「で」.",
    "writeup": "「にて」 is a formal particle that functions similarly to 「で」, indicating location, time, means, or method. It is often used in formal writing, announcements, and business settings. While 「で」 is more common in everyday conversation, 「にて」 adds a layer of formality. It emphasizes the noun preceding it, highlighting its role in the sentence. Consider it a more \"stilted and sophisticated\" way of saying 「で」. In conversation, you will sound stiff if you use it; therefore, it is best reserved for written contexts, signs, and public announcements.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To differentiate \"にて\" from similar particles, remember that \"にて\" primarily serves as a formal substitute for \"で\". It is appropriate in formal writing or announcements to convey sophistication. Avoid it in casual conversation, as it may sound overly stiff. In contrast, \"において\" and \"における\" function differently; they introduce a broader topic or specify a context, whereas \"にて\" simply marks the means, precise location, or specific time of an action.",
