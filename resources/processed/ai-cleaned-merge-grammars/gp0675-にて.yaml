    "etymology": "The grammar point 「にて」 originates from the particle 「に」 combined with the 「て」 form of the verb 「ある」, effectively creating a more formal alternative to 「で」. Over time, it has evolved into a standalone particle, retaining its formal nuance.",
    "writeup": "「にて」 is considered a standalone particle, though it originates from 「に」 and the conjunction particle 「て」. It acts as a formal case-marking particle, similar in function to 「で」, conveying meanings like \"with (A),\" \"by (A),\" \"at (A),\" or \"using (A).\" It typically follows nouns indicating a means, method, time, location, reason, or origin that the speaker emphasizes. Its formal register makes it more common in writing and formal announcements, while 「で」 is more natural in casual conversation.",
