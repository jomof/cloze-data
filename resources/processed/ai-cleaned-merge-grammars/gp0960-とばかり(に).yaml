    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とばかりに」combines the particle 「と」, used here to indicate a quote or thought, with 「ばかり」, meaning 'just' or 'only'. The 「に」 acts as an adverbial particle. Thus, 「とばかりに」 literally implies 'as if to say just that', conveying the nuance of someone's actions or expressions strongly suggesting a particular thought or statement.",
    "writeup": "「とばかりに」 is used to describe a situation where someone's actions or expressions strongly suggest a particular thought or statement, essentially 'as if to say'. It combines 「と」 (a quotative particle) with 「ばかり」 (meaning 'just' or 'only'), indicating something is almost, but not quite, explicitly stated. The 「に」 functions adverbially, modifying the verb that follows. It's a formal expression, often used in writing or in more serious conversations to describe the way someone acts or behaves as if they are about to say something, without actually saying it aloud.",
