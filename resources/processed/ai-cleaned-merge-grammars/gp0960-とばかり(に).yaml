    "etymology": "The construction とばかりに is derived from と (a particle indicating a quote or thought), ばかり (meaning 'only' or 'just'), and に (a particle indicating purpose or direction). Literally, it suggests something is done 'as if only to say' a particular thing, implying a strong but unspoken message. This expression is an abbreviation of と言わんばかりに, where 言わん is the classical negative form of 言う (言う + ぬ), meaning 'not say' or 'not speak'. Thus, と言わんばかりに literally translates to 'as if not saying', emphasizing that the action communicates the message without uttering the words.",
    "writeup": "「とばかりに」 is a construction used to describe an action or expression that strongly conveys an unspoken message or intention. It combines the quotation particle 「と」 with the adverbial particle 「ばかり」, which indicates an extent or limit, creating the sense of something being done to the extent of conveying that message. The core idea is that an action is performed as if to say something, making the unspoken message clear through the behavior itself. It highlights situations where a person's demeanor or actions are so telling that words become unnecessary. This expression is frequently used in narrative contexts to describe the actions of others, or one's own actions when viewed objectively, often implying a dramatic or strong communication. It's not typically used for simple, everyday non-verbal cues but rather for actions that carry significant implicit meaning.",
