    "etymology": "The construction とばかりに is derived from と (a particle indicating a quote or thought), ばかり (meaning 'only' or 'just'), and に (a particle indicating purpose or direction). Literally, it suggests something is done 'as if only to say' a particular thing, implying a strong but unspoken message.",
    "writeup": "とばかりに is used to describe a situation where someone's actions or expression strongly suggest a particular thought or feeling, almost as if they're saying it outright. It's like the unspoken words are hanging in the air. The nuance is that the person isn't actually saying the words, but their behavior makes it clear what they're thinking. It's a combination of と (the quote particle) and ばかり (meaning 'just' or 'only').  The に indicates the direction or purpose of the action.  It's often used to describe someone's reaction or behavior in a vivid way. The longer version of this grammar point is 「と 言わんばかりに」, which means \"as if on the verge of saying.\"",
