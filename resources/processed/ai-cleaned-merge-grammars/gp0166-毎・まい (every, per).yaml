    "etymology": "「毎」 (mai) itself means \"every\" or \"each\" in classical Chinese and Japanese. It is used to quantify or express repetition within a specific time frame or event. Its etymological root conveys a sense of recurrence, often linking to concepts of 'circulation' or 'each time'. This inherent meaning extends to its use as a prefix, indicating that the following noun occurs repeatedly.",
    "writeup": "「毎」 (mai) is a prefix attached to nouns that represent units of time or concepts closely associated with time. It expresses the meaning of \"every\" or \"per\". For example, 「毎日」 (mainichi) means \"every day,\" and 「毎月」 (maitsuki) means \"every month.\" Its application extends to concepts like meals (「毎食」 - maishoku, \"every meal\") or repeated visits (「毎度」 - maido, \"every time/each time\"), as these are fundamentally tied to temporal cycles or occurrences.\n\nIt's essential to remember that 「毎」 can only be used with nouns directly or conceptually related to time. For example, you can say 「毎食」 (maishoku) because meals are associated with time. However, it cannot be used with general nouns like 「人」 (hito, person) to mean 'every person'; instead, expressions like 「すべての人」 (subete no hito) or 「みんな」 (minna) are used. Similarly, 「毎先生」 (mai sensei, every teacher) or 「毎家」 (mai ie, every house) are incorrect, as these nouns do not inherently convey a unit or concept of time.",

            "nuance": "「毎」 is a prefix that combines with a noun to form a single lexical unit, often implying a regular, continuous occurrence or schedule (e.g., 「毎日」 'every day'). In contrast, 「ごとに」 is a suffix that attaches to nouns (often time-related) or dictionary forms of verbs. It emphasizes each individual instance or interval within a series, highlighting distinct, discrete occurrences rather than a continuous flow. For example, 「三時間ごとに」 (sanjikan-goto ni) means 'every three hours,' focusing on each individual three-hour block, whereas 「毎時間」 (maijikan) implies 'every hour,' implying a continuous hourly rhythm.",

        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「毎」 and 「ごとに」 can express concepts of repetition, their nuances differ subtly. 「毎」 suggests a more generalized, continuous, or habitual recurrence, often forming a single, common compound word (like 「毎日」 'every day'). 「ごとに」, however, isolates and emphasizes each instance or interval within a series, highlighting distinct, discrete occurrences. For example, 「五分ごとに水を飲む」 (gofun-goto ni mizu o nomu) would mean 'drinking water every five minutes,' emphasizing distinct five-minute intervals, whereas 「毎分水を飲む」 (maifun mizu o nomu) implies drinking water continuously minute by minute.\n\n「毎回」 (maikai) also means 'every time' or 'each time', but it functions as a standalone word, often referring to every single instance or occasion of an event or action, rather than forming a compound with a time unit. For instance, 「毎回テスト」 (maikai tesuto) means 'every test' (each instance of a test), while 「毎月テスト」 (maitsuki tesuto) means 'monthly tests.'\n\nFurthermore, 「～たび (に)」 (～tabi ni) conveys 'each occasion' or 'whenever,' often implying a conditional relationship where something happens every time a specific event occurs. It focuses on individual events, emphasizing what happens on each occasion of something else occurring. For example, 「旅行のたびに新しい発見がある」 (ryokō no tabi ni atarashii hakken ga aru) means 'every time I travel, there are new discoveries.' This is distinct from 「毎」 which typically describes a fixed, regular rhythm over a period of time.",
