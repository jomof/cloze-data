    "writeup": "くらい, often interchangeable with ぐらい (which is more common in spoken language), generally translates to \"about\" or \"approximately.\" It originates from the kanji 位, which signifies a \"rank\" or \"grade.\" This usage of くらい follows numbers or counter words, indicating an estimated quantity or extent.\n\nAs the examples show, くらい can also follow question words like どの to inquire about the extent or degree of something.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n*   While くらい and ころ can be used interchangeably when referring to a specific time, ころ is preferred when referring to broader periods.",
