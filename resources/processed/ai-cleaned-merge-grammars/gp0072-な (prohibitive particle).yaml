details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  register: casual
  particle-syntactic-function: sentence-final
  particle-pragmatic-function: assertion
  usage-context: Used to issue direct and strong prohibitions, often in informal settings, typically by
    male speakers or in situations demanding immediate, forceful injunctions. Can also be used by any
    speaker in highly emotional contexts.
  function: To convey a forceful negative command or prohibition.
  nuance: Direct, strong, and sometimes harsh. Its intensity depends on context and speaker-listener relationship.
    Can be softened by adding 「よ」 (e.g., 「～なよ」).
  colocation: Directly follows the dictionary form of verbs. Does not attach to nouns or adjectives.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a sentence-ending particle to mark a strong negative imperative.
  temporal-flow: Refers to a prohibition of an action starting immediately or in the future.
  spatial-flow: Used regardless of specific spatial context, though implied actions may be spatial.
etymology: The particle 「な」 is believed to have originated from the older negative imperative form 「な～そ」.
  Over time, the 「そ」 was dropped, leaving just 「な」 as the prohibitive form. This linguistic evolution
  highlights its historical role as a direct and forceful command.
writeup: |-
  The particle 「な」 attaches directly to the dictionary form of a verb to express a strong, direct prohibition, equivalent to saying "Don't!" or "Do not!". It conveys a forceful command to prevent an particular action.

  Due to its directness, 「な」 is primarily used in casual, informal speech. Traditionally, it is more commonly employed by male speakers, particularly when addressing individuals of equal or lower status, or subordinates. However, in highly emotional or urgent situations—such as a sudden warning or outburst of frustration—it can be used by anyone, regardless of gender.

  Therefore, it is crucial to use 「な」 with caution, as it can sound harsh, impolite, or even rude if directed towards superiors, strangers, or in formal settings. It lacks the politeness and deference found in other prohibitive expressions.

  To soften the intensity of the prohibition, the particle 「よ」 can be appended, forming 「～なよ」. This mitigates the directness, transforming the expression into more of a warning, advice, or a gentle plea rather than an outright command. For example, 「するなよ」 (Don't do it, okay?) is significantly milder than 「するな」 (Don't do it!). This distinction is vital for proper communication.
false_friends:
  - term: てください
    meaning: Please do (Polite request)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「な」, which is a strong prohibition, 「てください」 is a polite request to perform an action.
      They are opposite in function and politeness.
    grammar_point: てください (polite request)
  - term: てごらん
    meaning: (Please) try to, (Please) look
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「てごらん」 is an encouragement or suggestion for someone to try or observe something, implying
      a gentle invitation. It is not used for prohibition like 「な」.
    grammar_point: Verb[て] + ごらん (gentle suggestion)
  - term: なさい
    meaning: Command to do
    kind: antonym
    nuance: While both are commands, 「なさい」 tells someone to *do* something in a milder, often parental
      or instructional tone, whereas 「な」 tells someone *not to do* something, with a more forceful tone.
    grammar_point: なさい (polite imperative)
  - term: たまえ
    meaning: (Please) do!, Ask to, Beg to, (Order somebody to do something)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「たまえ」 is an archaic or very formal/authoritative command to do something, typically used by
      a superior to a subordinate. It contrasts with 「な」 by being an affirmative command and also differs
      greatly in register.
    grammar_point: たまえ (light command)
  - term: ないでください
    meaning: Please don't (Polite request)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Both 「な」 and 「ないでください」 prohibit an action, but 「ないでください」 is a polite and softer request, suitable
      for general situations, whereas 「な」 is direct and informal, often perceived as harsh.
    grammar_point: ないでください (please don't)
  - term: ないで
    meaning: Without doing or don't
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ないで」 can form part of a negative request (e.g., 「～ないでください」), its primary use is to
      indicate doing something 'without' performing another action (e.g., 「食べないで話す」 - talk without eating)
      or connecting clauses. It is not a direct prohibitive particle like 「な」.
    grammar_point: ないで (without doing or don't)
  - term: べきではない
    meaning: Should not, must not, ought not to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「べきではない」 conveys a moral or logical obligation not to do something, indicating that an action
      is inappropriate or inadvisable based on principles or common sense. 「な」, however, is a direct,
      imperative prohibition from the speaker.
    grammar_point: べきではない (should not)
  - term: てはいけない
    meaning: Must not do, Cannot do (prohibition)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「してはいけない」 signifies a general prohibition, stating that an action is forbidden or not allowed,
      often due to rules or circumstances. 「な」 is a more personal and forceful direct command from the
      speaker to prevent an action.
    grammar_point: てはいけない (must not・cannot)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「な」 is a strong and direct prohibition. Its usage often implies authority,
  urgency, or strong emotion. When politeness or a softer tone is required, opt for expressions like 「～ないでください」
  or 「～ない方がいい」. While expressions such as 「～べきではない」 or 「～してはいけない」 also convey negative injunctions, they
  refer to what is generally inadvisable or forbidden, rather than a direct command from the speaker,
  which is the specific function of 「な」.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 走ら ない で ください
        english: Please don't run.
        hint: The teacher is issuing an immediate, strong prohibition due to danger. 「走らないでください」 would
          be too polite and indirect for such an urgent situation, lacking the necessary force. We're
          looking for a very direct, strong prohibition.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 走る べき で は ない
        english: You shouldn't run.
        hint: 「走るべきではない」 suggests a general rule or advisability. The scene requires a direct, immediate
          command to stop an an action, not a general statement about what one shouldn't do.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 走っ ちゃ ダメ！
        english: You mustn't run!
        hint: 「走っちゃ ダメ」 is a common and slightly less harsh way to prohibit an action in casual speech,
          often used with children. Here, we're looking for a very direct, strong prohibition.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 走っ て は いけ ない！
        english: You must not run!
        hint: 「走って は いけない」 expresses a general rule or strong prohibition. While similar in meaning, it
          lacks the immediate, personal, direct command feel of the grammar point.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 走り なさい！
        english: Run!
        hint: 「走りなさい」 is an affirmative command to perform an action, often with a milder or instructional
          tone. We're looking for a direct prohibition, an order *not* to run.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 走ら ない で
        english: Don't run
        hint: 「走らないで」 is an incomplete negative te-form. While it can imply a softer prohibition, it lacks
          the definitive, forceful command of the grammar point. We're looking for a very direct, strong
          prohibition.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 走る なかれ
        english: Run not!
        hint: This is an archaic or classical form of prohibition, primarily found in written or very
          formal/poetic contexts. We're looking for a modern, direct, casual prohibition.
    scene: A teacher spots a child running in the school hallway.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: This is a direct, urgent command from a female teacher to a child. Even though 「な」 is often
      associated with male speech, its use here is justified by the immediate danger and the speaker's
      authority, making the command forceful and clear. The urgency overrides typical gendered usage.
  - english: Don't leak other people's secrets, okay?

          - 他人 の 秘密 を 漏らさ ない で ください
        english: Please don't leak other people's secrets.
        hint: The addition of 「よ」 softens the prohibition, making it sound like a gentle warning or advice
          between friends rather than a harsh command. 「漏らさないでください」 would be too formal for a casual conversation
          between close friends.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 他人 の 秘密 を 漏らす べき で は ない
        english: You shouldn't leak other people's secrets.
        hint: 「漏らすべきではない」 expresses a moral obligation, which is too strong for the friendly, advisory
          tone of the scene. The scene implies a more personal piece of advice rather than a general ethical
          rule.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 他人 の 秘密 を 漏らさ ない 方 が いい よ。
        english: It's better not to leak other people's secrets.
        hint: 「ない 方 が いい」 is advice that something is better not to do. This example uses a softer prohibition,
          like gentle advice, but it's still a direct command, not just a suggestion.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 他人 の 秘密 は 言っ ちゃ ダメ。
        english: You mustn't tell other people's secrets.
        hint: 「言っちゃ ダメ」 is a casual prohibition, but 「漏らす な よ」 carries a slightly more solemn or serious
          tone for advice between close friends.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 他人 の 秘密 を 漏らさ ない で
        english: Don't leak other people's secrets.
        hint: 「漏らさないで」 is an incomplete negative te-form. While it can imply an omitted request like `ください`
          or `くれ`, the grammar point provides a direct, slightly softened prohibition due to `よ`. We're
          looking for a direct prohibition that feels like gentle advice.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 他人 の 秘密 を 漏らし て は いけ ない
        english: You must not leak other people's secrets.
        hint: 「漏らしてはいけない」 states that an action is forbidden or not allowed. While strong, it lacks the
          personal, advisory tone of the grammar point, which is closer to a direct piece of advice. We're
          looking for a direct, but gentle prohibition.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 漏らし て は なら ない
        english: You must not leak it.
        hint: This is a very strong, formal prohibition, often used for rules or laws. The scene calls
          for a friendly, advisory tone, softened by 「よ」, not a strict rule.
    scene: A close friend advises another not to gossip.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The speaker is a younger female. The use of 「なよ」 softens the prohibition, making it a friendly
      piece of advice. This form is common in casual conversations among friends, regardless of gender,
      especially when delivering a warning with a caring tone.
  - english: Don't contact him anymore. It's none of your business.
    japanese:
      - もう 彼 に 連絡 する {な}。君 に は 関係 ない。
      - もう 彼 に は 連絡 する {な}。お前 に は 関係 ない。
      - もう あいつ に 連絡 する {な}。お前 に は 関係 ない。

      - competing_japanese:
          - もう 彼 に 連絡 し ない で ください
        english: Please don't contact him anymore.
        hint: The speaker is giving firm, direct advice to a close male friend, implying exasperation
          with the friend's actions. 「連絡 しないでください」 would be too formal and distant for this context, failing
          to convey the speaker's strong opinion.
      - competing_japanese:
          - もう 彼 に 連絡 する べき で は ない
        english: You shouldn't contact him anymore.
        hint: 「連絡 するべきではない」 implies a logical conclusion or a general rule, which is less about direct
          intervention in a personal situation. The scene calls for a direct, authoritative instruction
          from one friend to another.
      - competing_japanese:
          - もう 彼 に 連絡 し ない 方 が いい。
        english: You shouldn't contact him anymore.
        hint: This suggests something is better not to do, but the original sentence is a direct, strong
          command, emphasizing the speaker's firm stance.
      - competing_japanese:
          - もう 彼 に 連絡 し て は いけ ない。
        english: You must not contact him anymore.
        hint: 「て は いけない」 states that an action is forbidden or not allowed. While strong, it lacks the
          personal, direct order implied by the grammar point in this context.
      - competing_japanese:
          - もう 彼 に 連絡 し ない で
        english: Don't contact him anymore.
        hint: 「連絡しないで」 is an informal negative te-form. While conveying a prohibition, it doesn't carry
          the same blunt, authoritative command as the grammar point in this context. We're looking for
          a direct, serious prohibition.
      - competing_japanese:
          - もう 彼 と 関わる の は よせ。
        english: Stop getting involved with him.
        hint: 「よせ」 is a strong, informal command to stop something, but it's often slightly less blunt
          and more about telling someone to "cut it out" than 「な」's direct prohibition. We're looking
          for a direct, serious prohibition.
    scene: A man tells his male friend to stop meddling in a dispute.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The speaker is an older male giving a direct command to a male friend. The bluntness of 「連絡
      する な」 conveys the speaker's strong conviction and the seriousness of the situation, often seen in
      casual male-to-male interactions when expressing disapproval or firm advice.
  - english: Don't bother me!

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の 邪魔 を し ない で ください。
        english: Please don't bother me.
        hint: The speaker is expressing strong frustration and anger. 「邪魔 を しないでください」, while a polite
          negative request, lacks the forceful, immediate, and confrontational tone of 「邪魔 を する な！」 which
          conveys a sudden outburst of irritation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の 邪魔 を し て は いけ ない
        english: You must not bother me.
        hint: 「邪魔 を して は いけない」 implies a general prohibition or a rule. The scene requires a direct, personal
          rejection of an action, expressing the speaker's immediate state of mind rather than a general
          statement of what is forbidden.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 を 邪魔 し ない で くれ！
        english: Please don't bother me!
        hint: 「～て くれ」 is a request, even a direct one. The original expresses pure prohibition born of
          frustration, without any request element.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 を 邪魔 する ん じゃ ない！
        english: You're not to bother me!
        hint: 「～んじゃない」 is a common way to express prohibition in casual speech, but 「～な」 carries a more
          primitive, raw force for immediate, angry commands.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 邪魔 し ない で
        english: Don't bother me.
        hint: 「邪魔しないで」 is a gentler prohibition than the grammar point, which is used for a sudden, angry
          outburst. We're looking for a forceful, direct command reflecting frustration.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 邪魔 する べき で は ない
        english: You shouldn't bother me.
        hint: 「邪魔するべきではない」 suggests that bothering someone is generally inadvisable or inappropriate.
          The scene calls for a direct, personal command reflecting immediate anger, not a general statement
          of propriety. We're looking for a forceful, direct command reflecting frustration.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 構わ ない で くれ！
        english: Please don't interfere!
        hint: 「構わないでくれ」 is a request not to interfere, which is slightly less forceful and more pleading
          than the direct, angry command of 「邪魔 を する な！」. We're looking for a direct prohibition born
          of frustration.
    scene: A frustrated person yells at someone interrupting their work.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: This example shows 「な」 used by a female speaker in a moment of anger. While 「な」 is often gender-associated,
      intense emotions like frustration allow speakers of any gender to use this strong, direct prohibitive
      form. The sharpness of 「邪魔 を する な！」 emphasizes the speaker's irritation and demand for space.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 過去 に 囚われ ない で ください
        english: Please don't be trapped by the past.
        hint: This would be too mild and polite for a motivational speech intended to inspire decisive
          action. 「囚われる な」 is more impactful and direct, conveying the speaker's conviction and urging
          a powerful shift in mindset.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 過去 に 囚われる べき で は ない
        english: You shouldn't be trapped by the past.
        hint: This implies a moral or logical imperative, which is less about direct inspiration and more
          about a general truth. The scene calls for a direct, empowering injunction to the audience.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 過去 に 囚われる の は やめ なさい。
        english: Stop being trapped by the past.
        hint: 「～なさい」 is a command to *do* something (or stop doing something). This example is a direct
          prohibition, an order *not to* be trapped, rather than an an instruction to cease an action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 過去 に 囚われる の は やめろ。
        english: Stop being trapped by the past.
        hint: Similar to 「～なさい」, this is a command to stop an action. The original sentence directly prohibits
          a state of being, carrying a more declarative force in this motivational context.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 過去 に 囚われ ちゃ いけ ない。
        english: You must not be trapped by the past.
        hint: 「～ちゃ いけない」 expresses a general prohibition, but in this motivational speech, the grammar
          point delivers a direct, forceful injunction, empowering the audience to break free.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 過去 に 囚われ ない で
        english: Don't be trapped by the past.
        hint: 「囚われないで」 is the negative te-form, suggesting a gentler prohibition or request. In a motivational
          speech, the grammar point provides a much stronger, more impactful direct injunction. We're
          looking for a powerful, direct call to action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 過去 に 引きずら れる な。
        english: Don't be dragged down by the past.
        hint: While similar in meaning, 「引きずられる」 implies being pulled back by the past, a slightly different
          nuance than being "trapped" or "bound." The grammar point directly prohibits the state of being
          trapped.
    scene: A motivational speaker addresses their audience, urging them to embrace change.
    register: casual
    setting: inspirational
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: Even in an inspirational setting, the directness of 「な」 and 「見ろ」 creates a powerful, authoritative
      tone. The speaker, a male, leverages this casual, strong imperative to convey conviction and urgency,
      aligning with a persuasive and assertive communication style often used to motivate a group.
  - english: Don't worry so much.

        hint: The use of 「なよ」 softens the prohibition, turning it into reassuring advice between friends.
          「心配しない で ください」 would be too formal and polite for this casual, comforting situation. We're looking
          for a softer, friendly prohibition.
      - competing_japanese:
          - そんな に 心配 する べき で は ない。
        english: You shouldn't worry so much.
        hint: 「心配するべきではない」 expresses a logical or moral advisability. The scene calls for a personal,
          comforting piece of advice, not a general statement about what one ought not to do. We's looking
          for a softer, friendly prohibition.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 心配 し ない 方 が いい よ。
        english: It's better not to worry.
        hint: 「ない 方 が いい」 is advice, but 「なよ」 is still a direct, albeit softened, command or plea, conveying
          stronger empathy. We're looking for a softer, friendly prohibition.
    scene: A male friend comforting a female friend who is overthinking things.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「なよ」 softens the prohibition, turning it into reassuring advice. This is a common
      way for male speakers to offer comfort to female friends without sounding overly harsh, maintaining
      a friendly and supportive tone. 「そんなに」 (so much) emphasizes the excessive worrying.
  - english: Don't touch that! It's dangerous.
    japanese:
      - それ に 触る {な}！危ない ぞ。
      - 触る {な}！危ない！
      - 触っ ちゃ {な}！危ない から！
      - 手 を 出す {な}！危ない ぞ！
      - 危ない から 触る {な}！
    english_literally: That touch do not! Dangerous!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - それ に 触ら ない で ください。
        english: Please don't touch that.
        hint: The speaker is a mother issuing an immediate, strong prohibition due to danger. 「触らないでください」
          would be too polite and indirect for such an urgent situation, lacking the necessary force.
          We're looking for a very direct, strong prohibition.
      - competing_japanese:
          - それ に 触る べき で は ない。
        english: You shouldn't touch that.
        hint: 「触るべきではない」 suggests a general rule or advisability. The scene requires a direct, immediate
          command to prevent an action, not a general statement about what one shouldn't do. We're looking
          for a very direct, strong prohibition.
      - competing_japanese:
          - それ に 触っ ちゃ ダメ！
        english: You mustn't touch that!
        hint: 「触っちゃ ダメ」 is a common and slightly less harsh way to prohibit an action in casual speech,
          often used with children. While similar, the grammar point conveys a slightly more immediate
          and direct command. We're looking for a very direct, strong prohibition.
    scene: A mother scolding her child who is about to touch a hot stove.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: This is a direct, urgent command from a parent to a child in a moment of danger. The immediate
      threat overrides typical gender associations of 「な」, emphasizing the need for quick, forceful prohibition.
      The 「ぞ」 at the end further reinforces the warning, making it very direct and masculine-leaning,
      but acceptable for a mother in urgency.
  - english: Don't smoke here. It's prohibited.
    japanese:
      - ここ で タバコ を 吸う {な}。禁止 だ。
      - ここ で 吸う {な}。禁止 です。
      - この 場所 で タバコ を 吸う {な}。禁煙 だ。
      - ここ で 一 服 する {な}。禁止 だ。
      - 喫煙 は ここ で は する {な}。
    english_literally: Here tobacco smoke do not. Prohibited.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - ここ で タバコ を 吸わ ない で ください。
        english: Please don't smoke here.
        hint: While 「吸わないでください」 is polite, an employee might use 「な」 if they are being firm, or if it's
          a casual setting where a direct, no-nonsense approach is common. We're looking for a direct
          and firm prohibition.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ここ で タバコ を 吸う べき で は ない。
        english: You shouldn't smoke here.
        hint: 「吸うべきではない」 implies a general advisability. The scene requires a direct enforcement of a
          rule from an authority figure, not a general statement of what's appropriate. We're looking
          for a direct and firm prohibition.
      - competing_japanese:
          - ここ で タバコ を 吸っ て は いけ ませ ん。
        english: You must not smoke here.
        hint: 「吸っては いけ ませ ん」 is a formal prohibition. While strong, it lacks the directness of 「な」 in
          a casual or semi-formal context when delivering a firm command. We're looking for a direct and
          firm prohibition.
    scene: A store employee tells a customer not to smoke inside the store.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: Even in a customer service context, if the situation is casual enough (e.g., small local shop,
      or repeated offense), a male employee might use 「な」 to enforce a rule directly. It's less polite
      than 「吸わないでください」 but more direct and firm, emphasizing the prohibition. The directness conveys authority.
  - english: Don't give up! You can do it.
    japanese:
      - 諦める {な}！君 なら できる。
      - 諦める {な}！あなた なら できる わ。
      - 諦める {な}！絶対 できる から！
      - 諦める {な}！頑張れ！
      - 諦める {な}！きっと できる！
    english_literally: Give up do not! If it's you, you can do it.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 諦め ない で ください！
        english: Please don't give up!
        hint: This would be too polite and lacks the forceful encouragement needed from a coach. 「諦める
          な」 is much more impactful and direct, conveying strong belief and a powerful push to persevere.
          We're looking for a powerful, inspirational prohibition.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 諦める べき で は ない！
        english: You shouldn't give up!
        hint: 「諦めるべきではない」 implies a general truth or moral obligation. The scene calls for a direct, personal
          encouragement and a command to persist. We're looking for a powerful, inspirational prohibition.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 諦め て は いけ ない！
        english: You must not give up!
        hint: 「諦めては いけ ない」 states a strong prohibition but lacks the direct, personal motivational tone
          of 「な」 in this context. We're looking for a powerful, inspirational prohibition.
    scene: A coach encouraging an athlete during a tough training session.
    register: casual
    setting: inspirational
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: This shows 「な」 used in an encouraging, inspirational context, even by a female speaker. It's
      a direct, strong push to persevere. The directness emphasizes belief in the listener's capability
      and a desire for them to overcome, making it a powerful call to action rather than a harsh command.
  - english: Don't forget what I told you.
    japanese:
      - 俺 が 言っ た こと、忘れる {な} よ。
      - 私 が 言っ た こと、忘れる {な} よ。
      - 言っ た こと、忘れる {な} よ。
      - 大事 な こと だ から 忘れる {な} よ。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 俺 が 言っ た こと、忘れ ない で ください。
        english: Please don't forget what I told you.
        hint: The male speaker uses 「なよ」 to give a firm reminder to a junior. 「忘れない で ください」 would be too
          formal and polite, losing the emphasis and casual authority. We're looking for a firm, but slightly
          softened, prohibition.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 俺 が 言っ た こと、忘れる べき で は ない。
        english: You shouldn't forget what I told you.

          prohibition.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 俺 が 言っ た こと、忘れ て は いけ ない。
        english: You must not forget what I told you.
        hint: 「忘れては いけ ない」 is a strong, general prohibition. While similar, 「なよ」 is more personal and
          carries a nuance of a firm warning or reminder. We're looking for a firm, but slightly softened,
          prohibition.
    scene: A senior colleague giving important instructions to a junior colleague.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The male speaker uses 「なよ」 to emphasize the importance of the instruction. While it's a casual
      form, in a semi-formal setting between colleagues where there's a clear senior-junior dynamic, it
      can imply a firm reminder or a warning not to make a mistake, softened slightly by 「よ」. 「俺が言ったこと」
      (what I told you) is a casual male expression.
  - english: Don't be silly! You're really overreacting.
    japanese:
      - 馬鹿 な こと 言う {な}！大げさ だ よ。
      - 馬鹿 な こと 言う {な}！考え すぎ だ よ。
      - そんな 馬鹿 な こと 言う {な}！
      - ふざける {な}！
      - 冗談 言う {な}！

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 馬鹿 な こと を 言わ ない で ください。
        english: Please don't say silly things.
        hint: The speaker is expressing strong frustration or disbelief at the listener's words. 「言わない
          で ください」 would be too formal for this direct, exasperated correction among friends. We're looking
          for a direct, informal prohibition showing frustration.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 馬鹿 な こと を 言う べき で は ない。
        english: You shouldn't say silly things.
        hint: 「言うべきではない」 indicates general impoliteness. The scene calls for a direct, personal rebuke
          in response to a specific statement. We're looking for a direct, informal prohibition showing
          frustration.
    scene: A young person tells their friend not to be ridiculous during a casual conversation.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: This example shows 「な」 used by a young female speaker to express exasperation or dismiss a
      friend's comment as ridiculous. While direct, the casual context among friends makes it acceptable,
      demonstrating that 「な」 is not exclusively for male or harsh commands, especially when expressing
      strong feelings like disbelief or frustration in a familiar setting.
  - english: Don't forget your gratitude, no matter how famous you become.
    japanese:
      - どんな に 有名 に なっ て も、感謝 を 忘れる {な}。
      - どんな に 出世 し て も、感謝 を 忘れる {な}。
      - 偉く なっ て も、感謝 を 忘れる {な}。

          - どんな に 有名 に なっ て も、感謝 を 忘れ ない で ください。
        english: Please don't forget your gratitude, no matter how famous you become.
        hint: This is a profound piece of advice or life lesson being passed down. 「忘れない で ください」 would
          be too polite and lack the gravity and weight of the advice implied by the direct 「な」. We're
          looking for a strong, profound piece of advice.
      - competing_japanese:
          - どんな に 有名 に なっ て も、感謝 を 忘れる べき で は ない。
        english: You shouldn't forget your gratitude, no matter how famous you become.
        hint: 「忘れるべきではない」 frames it as a general moral imperative. The speaker is delivering a direct,
          personal lesson or warning. We're looking for a strong, profound piece of advice.
    scene: An older, experienced mentor gives advice to a promising young artist.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: inspirational
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: Here, an older male mentor uses 「な」 to impart a profound life lesson. While direct, the wisdom
      and experience of the speaker make it sound authoritative and deeply meaningful rather than harsh.
      It's a strong injunction, reflecting a core value the mentor wishes to instill.
  - english: Don't fall for such an obvious trick!
    japanese:
      - そんな 騙し に かかる {な}！
      - そんな 手 に 乗る {な}！

      - そんな 馬鹿 な 真似 する {な}！

          - そんな 騙し に かから ない で ください。
        english: Please don't fall for such a deception.
        hint: The speaker is expressing strong exasperation and urgency to prevent the listener from making
          a mistake. 「かからない で ください」 would be too polite and slow for this immediate warning. We're looking
          for a direct, urgent warning.
      - competing_japanese:
          - そんな 騙し に かかる べき で は ない！
        english: You shouldn't fall for such a deception!
        hint: 「かかるべきではない」 implies a general rule of prudence. The scene requires a direct, urgent intervention
          to stop a pending mistake. We're looking for a direct, urgent warning.
    scene: A quick-thinking friend warns another just before they make a mistake.
    register: casual
    setting: cautious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: This illustrates 「な」 in a rapid, urgent warning between friends. The male speaker's use of
      「な」 conveys a sense of immediate concern and exasperation, demanding quick action to avoid a foreseeable
      pitfall. It's a direct, unvarnished warning that gets straight to the point.
  - english: Don't interrupt my story!
    japanese:
      - 私 の 話 の 邪魔 を する {な}！
      - 話 の 邪魔 を する {な}！
      - 私 が 話し て いる 時 に 邪魔 する {な}！
      - 口 を 挟む {な}！
      - 黙っ て 聞け！邪魔 する {な}！
    english_literally: My story's interruption do not!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の 話 の 邪魔 を し ない で ください。
        english: Please don't interrupt my story.
        hint: The speaker is asserting control over the conversation with some irritation. 「邪魔をしない で ください」
          would be too polite and lack the directness needed to firmly tell someone not to interrupt.
          We're looking for a direct, slightly irritated prohibition.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の 話 の 邪魔 を する べき で は ない。
        english: You shouldn't interrupt my story.
        hint: 「邪魔するべきではない」 indicates general impoliteness. The scene calls for a direct, personal command
          to cease an immediate action. We're looking for a direct, slightly irritated prohibition.
    scene: Someone telling a story gets annoyed by an interruption and tells the interrupter to stop.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: This example highlights the use of 「な」 to express irritation and assert authority over a situation,
      regardless of gender. The speaker is annoyed by the interruption and uses this direct command to
      regain control, conveying a clear boundary. The tone is firm and slightly confrontational, typical
      in moments of frustration.
post_example_writeup: Understanding the nuances of 「な」 is key to speaking Japanese naturally. While it's
  a direct prohibitive command, its perceived harshness can be softened with 「よ」, making it suitable for
  advice or warnings among friends. Remember that the choice between 「な」 and other prohibitive forms like
  「～ないでください」 or 「～てはいけない」 depends heavily on the desired level of directness, formality, and the speaker's
  emotional state.
