    "etymology": "The grammar point 「によらず」 is derived from the verb 「依る (yoru)」, meaning \"to depend on\" or \"to be based on.\" The 「ず (zu)」 is a classical negative ending. Therefore, 「によらず」 literally translates to \"without depending on.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「によらず」 is used to express that something is true or remains unchanged despite a certain condition or factor. It conveys a sense of independence or impartiality, emphasizing that the specified factor does not influence the outcome. This structure is versatile and can be applied to various elements, including nouns, question words, and contrasting pairs.\n\nIt is generally considered a **formal** expression, commonly found in written contexts, official statements, and academic discussions, though it can appear in spoken language when emphasizing a strong, unwavering stance.\n\n### Usage Patterns:\n*   **Noun + によらず**: Directly connects to a noun, signifying that the situation holds true \"regardless of\" or \"irrespective of\" that noun.\n*   **Wh-word + によらず**: Used with interrogative words (e.g., 誰, 何, どんな) to mean \"no matter who/what/how/etc.\"\n*   **Contrasting Pairs (X か Y か / X かどうか / X(affirmative) X(negative) / X Y)**: This pattern is particularly powerful for emphasizing that a decision or outcome is independent of a binary choice or a spectrum. It effectively says \"whether X or Y, it doesn't matter; the situation is the same.\"\n\nUnderstanding 「によらず」 helps in expressing a firm, objective perspective, highlighting that certain conditions are irrelevant to the main point being conveyed.",
