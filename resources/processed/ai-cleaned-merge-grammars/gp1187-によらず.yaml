    "writeup": "The grammar point 「によらず」 means \"regardless of,\" \"irrespective of,\" or \"without being influenced by.\" It's used to indicate that a certain condition or factor does not affect the outcome or situation. Think of it as saying that something is true *no matter what* the preceding noun or phrase is. It's a formal expression, often found in written language or more serious conversations. It's similar in meaning to 「を問わず」, but 「によらず」 tends to have a stronger nuance of independence or irrelevance. \n\n「によらず」 can connect to nouns, question words (like 「誰」 or 「何」), or phrases indicating alternatives (like 「AかBか」). It emphasizes that the following statement holds true *regardless* of these preceding elements.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   **Formality**: This grammar is relatively formal and is less common in casual conversation.\n*   **Written Language**: You'll find 「によらず」 frequently used in formal writing, such as news articles, reports, and academic papers.\n*   **Nuance of Independence**: It emphasizes the independence of the statement from the preceding condition.",
