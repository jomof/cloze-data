    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「によらず」 is derived from the verb 「依る (yoru)」, meaning \"to depend on\" or \"to be based on.\" The 「ず (zu)」 is a classical negative ending. Therefore, 「によらず」 literally translates to \"without depending on.\" Its historical usage reflects the negation of dependency, evolving to mean 'regardless of' in broader contexts.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「によらず」 is utilized to convey that a particular outcome, decision, or state of affairs remains constant, irrespective of a specific condition or factor. It strongly asserts the independence or impartiality of the main clause from the preceding element. This construction highlights that the stated factor has no influence over the result.\n\nThis is a **formal** expression, predominantly encountered in written communication, official documents, academic papers, and situations requiring a high degree of objectivity or a firm stance. While less common in everyday casual conversation, its usage lends a sense of gravity and clarity to the statement.\n\n### Usage Patterns:\n*   **Noun + によらず**: This is the most direct application, indicating that the situation holds true \"regardless of\" or \"irrespective of\" the noun. For example, 「性別 {によらず}」 (regardless of gender).\n*   **Wh-word + によらず**: When combined with interrogative words (e.g., 誰, 何, どんな), it forms expressions like 「誰 {によらず}」 (no matter who) or 「どんな状況 {によらず}」 (no matter what the situation), emphasizing that the outcome is constant despite variability.\n*   **Contrasting Pairs**: This category encompasses several sub-patterns using contrasting words or phrases (e.g., X か Y か, X かどうか, X(affirmative) X(negative), X Y). These patterns are particularly effective for stressing that an outcome is independent of a binary choice or a spectrum of possibilities. It conveys a sense of \"whether X or Y, the result is the same; the condition is irrelevant.\"\n\nMastery of 「によらず」 allows for precise and objective communication, underscoring that specific conditions are non-determinant factors in the context being discussed.",
