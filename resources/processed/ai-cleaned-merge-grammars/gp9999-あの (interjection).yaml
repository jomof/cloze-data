grammar_point: あの (interjection)
learn_before:
  - この・その・あの・どの (demonstrative determiners)
id: gp9999
meaning: um; oh; hey (interjection for hesitation, realization, or attention)
pronunciation:
  katakana: アノ
  romaji: ano
formation:
  あの: Used as a standalone interjection.
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: interjection
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to express hesitation, to call for attention, or to indicate a sudden realization
    or recall.
  function: Discourse marker, attention-getter, verbal filler.
  nuance: Can soften a statement, create a polite pause, or signal a thought in progress. Generally mild
    and less intrusive than a direct call.
etymology: The interjection 「あの」 shares its phonetic form with the demonstrative adjective 「あの」 (that,
  over there), but its usage as a discourse marker is distinct. While the demonstrative points to something
  spatially or conceptually distant, the interjection 「あの」 marks a cognitive or social space—a pause in
  thought, a moment of seeking attention, or a sudden mental connection. It's akin to English 'um,' 'uh,'
  'oh,' or 'hey,' signifying a temporary break or transition in communication.
writeup: "The interjection 「あの」 is a versatile and fundamental word in Japanese conversation. It serves\
  \ several key functions, often depending on context, intonation, and accompanying body language. \n\n\
  **1. Hesitation or Pause (『あの、ちょっと...』)**\nThis is perhaps its most common use. When a speaker is searching\
  \ for the right words, collecting their thoughts, or preparing to say something potentially sensitive\
  \ or difficult, 「あの」 can create a brief, polite pause. It signals to the listener that the speaker is\
  \ about to say something, but is taking a moment. It's similar to \"um\" or \"uh\" in English, but often\
  \ carries a slightly more polite or considerate nuance.\n\n**2. Calling Attention or Initiating Conversation\
  \ (『あの、すみません』)**\n「あの」 can be used to gently get someone's attention before making a request, asking\
  \ a question, or starting a conversation. It's less abrupt than a direct name call and is a polite way\
  \ to signal your intention to speak. When used this way, it is often followed by expressions like 「すみません」\
  \ (excuse me) or 「ちょっといいですか」 (do you have a moment?).\n\n**3. Realization or Recall (『あの、そういえば...』)**\n\
  Sometimes, 「あの」 is used when a speaker suddenly remembers something, has an insight, or connects a new\
  \ piece of information to the current conversation. In this sense, it's similar to \"oh\" or \"that\
  \ reminds me\" in English. It indicates a shift in the speaker's internal thought process that is now\
  \ being verbalized.\n\n**4. Softening a Statement or Request (『あの、これ、貸してもらえますか？』)**\nBy preceding a\
  \ request or a potentially awkward statement with 「あの」, the speaker can soften its impact, making it\
  \ sound less demanding or direct. This adds a layer of politeness and consideration, indicating that\
  \ the speaker is mindful of the listener's feelings.\n\n「あの」 is primarily used in casual and semi-formal\
  \ contexts, often signaling a momentary hesitation or a gentle way to approach someone or introduce\
  \ a topic."

  - term: あの
    meaning: that (over there)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike the interjection 「あの」, this refers to something physically distant from both speaker
      and listener, or something mutually known but not present. It functions as a demonstrative determiner
      modifying a noun.
    grammar_point: この・その・あの・どの (demonstrative determiners)
  - term: えっと
    meaning: umm; well; let me see
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「えっと」 is a pure filler word indicating hesitation or a search for words, often used when one
      is unsure of what to say next. While 「あの」 can also serve as a filler, it has additional functions
      like calling attention or indicating realization, which 「えっと」 typically does not.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:えっと (hesitation sound)
  - term: あのね
    meaning: hey (listen); you know
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「あのね」 is a slightly more direct, yet still soft, way to get someone's attention, often used
      when the speaker wants to share some information or start a specific topic. It implies a desire
      for the listener to prepare for what's coming. 「あの」 alone is more general and can be used for simple
      hesitation without necessarily leading into a disclosure.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:あのね (attention seeking)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「あの」 as an interjection shares its pronunciation with the demonstrative
  「あの」, their functions are entirely different. The demonstrative 「あの」 points to something, whereas the
  interjection signals a pause in thought or a social cue. When comparing 「あの」 to other hesitation sounds
  like 「えっと」, remember that 「あの」 is more versatile, capable of drawing attention or indicating a sudden
  realization, beyond just filling a silence. 「あのね」 is a specific conversational opener, slightly more
  insistent than a simple 「あの」.

        english: Uhm, excuse me, could you tell me the way to the station?
        hint: 「えっと」 is a pure hesitation sound, while 「あの」 here is also used to politely catch someone's
          attention. We're looking for an interjection that both signals a pause and politely initiates
          a request.

        english: Ah, that's right! I have to go to the store today.

      not a direct topic. This demonstrates the dual use within a single sentence.'

      topic.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, 「あの」 is a remarkably versatile interjection. Its
  meaning and function are heavily influenced by context, intonation, and what follows it. It can be a
  simple filler, a polite way to enter a conversation, or a signal of a sudden thought or realization.
