    "etymology": "The grammar point 「よう」 originates from the classical Japanese auxiliary verb 「む」 (mu), which expressed conjecture, intention, or purpose. Over time, it evolved and converged with the volitional form of verbs (e.g., 行かむ → 行こう). Its connection to 「言う(いう)」 (iu) (to say) is a common misunderstanding; while 「言う」 expresses direct verbalization, 「よう」 in this context has primarily functioned as a modal auxiliary for conjecture and suggestion.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「よう」 expresses conjecture, high probability, or what is natural to expect. It is frequently used in written language and formal speech, lending a more formal and literary tone compared to its modern counterpart 「だろう」.\n\nHere are its primary usages:\n\n*   **Verb (plain form) + よう / であろう**: This is used with verbs (including potential, negative, and past forms) to indicate likelihood or possibility. For example, 「読めよう」 (yomeyou) implies that something can probably be read or understood, often in a general or objective sense. 「であろう」 often carries a slightly stronger sense of certainty or a more detached, analytical tone.\n\n*   **I-Adjective (stem) + かろう / (Plain Form) + であろう**: 「かろう」 is a classical and literary form of conjecture for i-adjectives, as seen in 「苦しかろう」. A more regular formal expression is to attach 「であろう」 to the plain form of the i-adjective, like 「苦しいであろう」.\n\n*   **Noun / な-Adjective (stem) + であろう / (である)よう**: This form is used with nouns and な-adjectives to express a likely or certain state of being. For instance, 「便利であろう」 (benri de arou) suggests that something is probably or must be convenient, often presented as an objective assessment. 「であるよう」 is another formal option, emphasizing the state or condition.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   「よう」 is significantly more formal and literary than 「だろう」. It is rarely heard in casual conversation in modern Japanese, making it primarily a feature of written communication, academic discourse, or very formal speeches.\n*   It often conveys a sense of logical conclusion or inherent truth, rather than a mere guess. This makes it suitable when discussing general principles or outcomes that are presented as self-evident.\n*   While it shares semantic overlap with 「だろう」, the choice between them largely depends on the desired register and formality. In contemporary spoken Japanese, 「だろう」 is overwhelmingly more common for expressing conjecture.",

Finally, 「はずだ」 denotes an expectation based on known information or reasons.
