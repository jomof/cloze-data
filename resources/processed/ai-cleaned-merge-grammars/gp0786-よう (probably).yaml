    "writeup": "The grammar point 「よう」 expresses a high degree of certainty or strong likelihood. It suggests that something is very probable or a natural consequence. It's often translated as \"probably,\" \"likely,\" or \"must be.\"\n\n**Key points:**\n\n*   「よう」 is primarily used in **formal writing** and **formal speech**.\n*   It often implies that the speaker has a good reason to believe something is likely to happen.\n*   It is similar to 「だろう」 and 「でしょう」, but more formal.\n\n**Formations:**\n\n*   **Verb (volitional form) + よう**: Indicates a likelihood or potential. For example, 「読めよう」 (yomeyou) means \"probably can read.\"\n*   **Noun + particle + よう**: Indicates that it is natural that such noun + particle would happen. For example, 「日本語が分かろう」 (nihongo ga wakarou) means \"It's natural that someone understands Japanese.\"\n*   **Adjective (な-stem) + であろう**: Indicates that something must be likely to be the adjective. For example, 「便利であろう」 (benri de arou) means \"It is likely to be convenient.\"",
