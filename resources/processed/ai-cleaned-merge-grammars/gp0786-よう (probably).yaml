    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「よう」 originates from the classical Japanese auxiliary verb 「む」 (mu), which expressed conjecture, intention, or purpose. Over time, it evolved and converged with the volitional form of verbs (e.g., 行かむ → 行こう). Its connection to 「言う(いう)」 (iu), meaning \"to say,\" is a common misunderstanding; while 「言う」 expresses direct verbalization, 「よう」 in this context has primarily functioned as a modal auxiliary for conjecture and suggestion.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「よう」 expresses conjecture, high probability, or what is natural to expect. It is frequently used in written language and formal speech, lending a more formal and literary tone compared to its modern counterpart 「だろう」.\n\nHere are its primary usages:\n\n*   **Verb (volitional form) + よう**: This is used with verbs, especially non-volitional verbs (verbs that describe phenomena or states that occur without conscious human control), to indicate likelihood or possibility. For example, 「読めよう」 (yomeyou) implies that something can probably be read or understood, often in a general or objective sense.\n\n*   **Noun + Particle + よう**: This pattern indicates a natural consequence or a strong probability related to the preceding noun. For instance, 「目も覚めよう」 (me mo sameyou) suggests that it's natural for one to wake up under certain circumstances, implying an inevitable outcome.\n\n*   **な-Adjective (stem) + であろう**: This form is used with な-adjectives to express a likely or certain state of being. 「便利であろう」 (benri de arou) suggests that something is probably or must be convenient, often presented as an objective assessment.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   「よう」 is significantly more formal and literary than 「だろう」. It is rarely heard in casual conversation in modern Japanese, making it primarily a feature of written communication, academic discourse, or very formal speeches.\n*   It often conveys a sense of logical conclusion or inherent truth, rather than a mere guess. This makes it suitable when discussing general principles or outcomes that are presented as self-evident.\n*   While it shares semantic overlap with 「だろう」, the choice between them largely depends on the desired register and formality. In contemporary spoken Japanese, 「だろう」 is overwhelmingly more common for expressing conjecture.",

Finally, 「はずだ」 denotes an expectation based on known information or reasons. Choosing the correct expression depends heavily on the context, desired level of formality, and the speaker's confidence in the conjecture.",
