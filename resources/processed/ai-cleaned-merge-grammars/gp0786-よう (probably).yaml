    "etymology": "The grammar point 「よう」 originates from the verb 「言う(いう)」(iu), meaning \"to say.\" Over time, it evolved into an auxiliary verb to express conjecture, intention, or purpose.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「よう」 expresses conjecture, high probability, or what is natural to expect. It is frequently used in written language and formal speech. It is similar to 「だろう」, but 「よう」 has a more formal and literary feel. Here are the primary usages:\n\n*   **Volitional Form + よう**: Used with verbs, especially non-volitional verbs, to indicate likelihood or possibility. For example, 「読めよう」 (yomeyou) implies someone can probably read something.\n*   **Noun + Particle + よう**: Indicates a natural consequence or high probability related to the noun. For instance, 「目も覚めよう」 (me mo sameyou) means it's natural for one to wake up.\n*   **な-Adjective (stem) + であろう**: Expresses a likely or certain state for な-adjectives. 「便利であろう」 (benri de arou) suggests something is probably or must be convenient.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n*   「よう」 is more formal and literary compared to 「だろう」.\n*   It is often used when discussing general truths or logical outcomes.\n*   In modern conversation, 「だろう」 is much more common.",
