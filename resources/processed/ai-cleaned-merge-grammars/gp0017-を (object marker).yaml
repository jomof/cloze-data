Think of it as connecting the verb to the thing receiving the action. For example, in the sentence \"I read a book,\" を would mark \"book\" because the action of reading is being done to the book.\n\nWhile primarily used to mark direct objects, を can also indicate the place **through** which an action occurs, particularly with verbs of motion like 歩く (aruku - to walk) or 走る (hashiru - to run). In such cases, it emphasizes the interaction with the place itself.",

Over time, its meaning shifted to 'to give up' or 'to resign oneself to something' once a situation became clear and there was no further option. It implies accepting a fate or outcome clearly. This change reflects the shift from intellectual clarity to emotional resolution. Therefore, giving up on a dream in this context implies making peace with the reality that the dream is unattainable, not simply abandoning it. The word reflects a deeper sense of internal acceptance of the situation."
