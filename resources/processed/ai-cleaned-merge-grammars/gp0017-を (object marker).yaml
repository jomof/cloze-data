Think of it as connecting the verb to the thing receiving the action. For example, in the sentence \"I read a book,\" を would mark \"book\" because the action of reading is being done to the book.\n\nWhile primarily used to mark direct objects, を can also indicate the place **through** which an action occurs, particularly with verbs of motion like 歩く (aruku - to walk) or 走る (hashiru - to run).
