        "usage-context": "Used with transitive verbs to mark their direct object, and with verbs of motion to indicate the path traversed. It is a fundamental particle in Japanese sentence structure."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle を originates from the verb 乎 (o) meaning \"to call, to hail.\" Over time, it transitioned from indicating direction or destination to marking direct objects.",
    "writeup": "The particle を marks the direct object of a transitive verb. In simpler terms, it identifies **what** or **whom** the subject is acting upon. Think of it as connecting the verb to the thing receiving the action. For example, in the sentence \"I read a book,\" を would mark \"book\" because the action of reading is being done to the book.\n\nWhile primarily used to mark direct objects, を can also indicate the place **through** which an action occurs, particularly with verbs of motion like 歩く (aruku - to walk) or 走る (hashiru - to run). In such cases, it emphasizes the interaction with the place itself.",
