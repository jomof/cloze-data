    "etymology": "The verb 「もらう」 (morau) originally meant 「いただき物をする」 (itadakimono o suru), \"to receive something humbly.\" It comes from the verb 「う」 (u), meaning \"to receive,\" with the honorific prefix 「も」 (mo) attached. Over time, the meaning broadened to include any kind of receiving, not just humble receipt. The kanji is 受.",
    "writeup": "「もらう」 (morau) is a verb used to express receiving something. It's commonly taught alongside 「くれる」 (kureru) and 「あげる」 (ageru), which deal with giving. Unlike 「くれる」 and 「あげる」, 「もらう」 focuses on the recipient of the action. The giver is marked with the particle 「に」 (ni) or 「から」 (kara), while the recipient is marked with 「が」 (ga) or 「は」 (wa), and the object received is marked with 「を」 (o). The recipient and giver can often be omitted if the context is clear.",
