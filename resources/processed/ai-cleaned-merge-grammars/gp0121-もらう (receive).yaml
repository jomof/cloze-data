    "etymology": "The verb 「もらう」 (morau) is believed to have originated from the verb 「う」 (u), meaning \"to receive,\" to which the honorific prefix 「も」 (mo) was attached. This created an expression originally conveying \"to receive humbly\" or \"to be given.\" Over time, its usage broadened to encompass any general act of receiving or obtaining, losing some of its initial humble connotation. The kanji most commonly associated with 'morau' is 貰う, which directly means 'to receive.' However, its etymological root often links it to the concept of 受け止める (uketomeru), 'to receive or catch something,' which shares the kanji 受 with う.",
    "writeup": "「もらう」 (morau) is a fundamental Japanese verb that signifies the act of receiving or obtaining something. It is a crucial component of the giving and receiving verb system in Japanese, often studied in conjunction with 「くれる」 (kureru) and 「あげる」 (ageru). Unlike 「くれる」 (which focuses on someone giving *to the speaker or their in-group*) and 「あげる」 (which focuses on the speaker giving *to someone else*), 「もらう」 places the emphasis squarely on the recipient of the action.\n\nWhen using 「もらう」, the giver is typically marked by the particle 「に」 (ni) or 「から」 (kara), while the object being received is marked by 「を」 (o). The recipient, being the subject of the verb, is marked by 「が」 (ga) or 「は」 (wa). In many contexts, if the recipient or giver is clear from the situation, they may be omitted from the sentence, allowing for more concise communication.\n\nThis verb highlights the active role of the recipient in obtaining something, whether it's a physical object, money, or even intangible things like advice or a favor. It is a versatile verb used in a wide range of situations, from casual conversations to more formal settings.",
