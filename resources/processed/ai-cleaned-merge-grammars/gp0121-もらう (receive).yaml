    "etymology": "The verb 「もらう」 shares its origin with 「賜る (tamawaru)」, which is a humble expression (謙譲語, kenjōgo) used to respectfully receive something from a superior. Over time, 「もらう」 evolved into a more general term for receiving.",
    "writeup": "「もらう」 is one of three verbs commonly taught together: 「くれる」, 「あげる」, and 「もらう」. It emphasizes that something is \"received\" by someone. Unlike 「くれる」 and 「あげる」, which highlight that something is \"given,\" 「もらう」 requires the 「に」 particle (or 「から」) to mark the giver, not the recipient. The recipient is marked with 「が」 or 「は」, as they are the one performing the action of receiving. 「を」 marks the object being given.\n\nThe giver or recipient is often omitted if it's obvious from context. For example, in 「(私は)明後日給料をもらいます。」, the recipient 「私」 is omitted because it is implied.\n\n*Important Considerations:*\n\n*   The focus of 「もらう」 is on the recipient and the act of receiving.\n*   Pay close attention to the particles used to differentiate the giver and receiver.",
