meaning: mood・disposition
pronunciation:
  katakana: キブン
  romaji: kibun
formation:
  気分: A noun referring to one's mood or the atmosphere.
  Noun + が 気分 が いい/悪い: Expressing good or bad mood.
  気分転換: Used in compounds to indicate a change of mood or pace.
jlpt: N5
etymology: 気分 combines 気 (ki), meaning 'spirit, mind, air', and 分 (bun), meaning 'part, share, portion'.
  Historically, 気 (ki) in this context referred to vital energy or temperament, and 分 (bun) denoted a
  division or aspect. Thus, 気分 literally conveys a 'portion' or 'aspect' of one's 'spirit' or 'energy',
  leading to its meaning of mood, feeling, or disposition. This explains why it can apply to both internal
  feelings and the 'feeling' or atmosphere of a place.
writeup: 気分 (きぶん) is a versatile Japanese noun that primarily refers to a **mood, feeling, or disposition**.
  It can describe both your **internal emotional or physical state** and the **external atmosphere or
  ambiance** of a place or situation. When referring to a person's state, 気分 often indicates a temporary
  feeling or disposition. For instance, if you are feeling unwell, you might say 気分が悪い (きぶんがわるい). If you
  are feeling pleasant and light-hearted, you might say 気分がいい (きぶんがいい). It's important to distinguish
  this from more specific emotions or physical sensations, as 気分 is quite general. 気分 can also be used
  to describe the **atmosphere or general "feel"** of a place, event, or situation. For example, you might
  talk about the 楽しい気分 (たのしいきぶん - pleasant atmosphere) of a party, even if it's literally describing the
  feeling *at* the party rather than the party itself having a "mood." This word is widely used in various
  contexts, from casual conversations among friends to more formal discussions. Its meaning is generally
  understood from the context and the accompanying verbs or adjectives. Common collocations include 気分転換
  (きぶんてんかん - a change of pace, literally "mood change") and 気分屋 (きぶんや - a moody person).

  - term: 気持ち
    meaning: feeling, sensation, emotion
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 気分 and 気持ち relate to internal states, 気持ち often implies a more direct, often physical,
      sensation or a deeper, more specific emotion. For example, 気持ちがいい can mean "feels good" physically
      (e.g., a warm bath), or emotionally (e.g., feeling touched by kindness). 気分がいい is more about a general
      state of well-being or good humor.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:気持ち (feeling・sensation)
  - term: 機嫌
    meaning: temper, humor, mood (especially in relation to others)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 機嫌 specifically refers to one's mood or temper, often implying how that mood affects interactions
      with others or is perceived by others. For example, 機嫌がいい means "in a good temper" or "in a good
      humor," implying readiness for pleasant interaction. 機嫌を損ねる means "to offend someone." It has a
      stronger connotation of one's disposition influencing others.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:機嫌 (temper・humor)
  - term: 雰囲気
    meaning: atmosphere, ambiance, mood (of a place/situation)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 雰囲気 is almost exclusively used for the atmosphere or ambiance of a place, situation, or group,
      rather than an individual's internal mood. While 気分 can refer to an atmosphere, 雰囲気 is the primary
      and more natural choice for describing the external feeling or aura.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:雰囲気 (atmosphere・ambiance)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 気分, 気持ち, 機嫌, and 雰囲気 all relate to feelings or "mood," their usage differs
  subtly. 気分 is a general term for one's overall disposition or a general atmosphere. 気持ち often delves
  into more specific feelings or physical sensations. 機嫌 focuses on one's temper, particularly how it
  influences interactions. 雰囲気 is specifically about the external atmosphere or ambiance of a place or
  situation. Understanding these distinctions will help you choose the most appropriate word for each
  context.

    scene: A teenager expressing their passion for gaming.

          the overall mood.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 の 優しい 言葉 が、私 を 元気 に し て くれ た。
        english: Her kind words cheered me up/made me energetic.
        hint: 元気にする (げんきにする) means to make someone energetic or cheerful. While it implies a lifted spirit,
          it's more about energy/liveliness than a change in 'mood'. We're looking for the direct impact
          on one's mood.
    scene: A person sharing how a friend's compassion helped them.
    register: casual
    setting: supportive
    conjugation: past plain (～た)

      is an active way of describing how 気分 can be influenced.

  mind and atmosphere. Pay attention to the particles and verbs used with it, as they often clarify the
  precise nuance.
