        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Used to express uncontrollable, naturally arising feelings or intense emotional states, often ongoing rather than momentary. Primarily used in written language or formal speech.",
        "function": "Expresses a strong, uncontainable degree of a feeling or state, emphasizing the involuntary nature of the emotion.",
        "nuance": "Implies that the speaker cannot control or escape the intensity of the feeling, often used for internal, spontaneous reactions."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てならない」 is formed by combining the て-form of a verb or adjective with 「ならない」, which is the negative form of 「なる」 (to become). Literally, 「ならない」 means 'does not become' or 'cannot become'. Thus, the phrase conveys a state so intense that it 'cannot become' anything other than what it is; it cannot be helped or changed. This structure emphasizes the involuntary and overwhelming nature of the emotion or state, as if it's a feeling that one simply cannot escape or control.",
    "writeup": "The 「てならない」 construction is used to express strong, often **uncontrollable feelings or emotions**. It indicates that one cannot help but feel a certain way, or that something is extremely [adjective]. It is particularly common for feelings that arise naturally and spontaneously within a person, rather than being a result of conscious thought or effort. The feeling or state described by 「てならない」 tends to be **ongoing** rather than momentary.\n\nThis expression emphasizes the intensity of the feeling to the point that the speaker feels they have no control over it. It is often translated as 'extremely', 'very', or 'can't help but feel/do'.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n*   **Uncontrollable:** The feeling is strong and involuntary; the speaker cannot suppress or escape it.\n*   **Natural Occurrence:** Often used for emotions that arise naturally, such as worry, joy, loneliness, or irritation.\n*   **Ongoing State:** The feeling typically persists rather than being a fleeting sensation.\n*   **Formality:** 「てならない」 carries a more formal tone compared to similar expressions like 「てたまらない」 or 「てしょうがない」, making it more common in written language or formal speech.",
