    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てならない」 comes from the combination of the て-form of a verb or adjective and 「ならない」, which is the negative form of 「なる」 (to become). Literally, it suggests a state of \"not becoming\" something else, implying an inability to escape a certain feeling or condition.",
    "writeup": "The 「てならない」 construction is used to express strong, often uncontrollable feelings or emotions. It indicates that one cannot help but feel a certain way, or that something is extremely (adjective). It's often used for feelings that arise naturally. The (A) that is modified by 「てならない」 tends to be ongoing rather than momentary. This expression is considered more formal and is often found in writing.",
