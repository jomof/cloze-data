    "etymology": "「だけでなく」 is derived from 「だけ」 (only) + 「ではない」 (it is not) + conjunctive 「て」, meaning that it's not *just* the thing mentioned. The 「は」 is often dropped or changed to 「じゃ」 for ease of pronunciation.",
    "writeup": "「だけでなく」, an abbreviation of 「だけではなく」, is a common construction in Japanese that translates to \"not only (A), but also (B)\". Sometimes the (B) statement may be left unsaid. This expression can connect to any (A) phrase that 「だけ」 would usually be able to connect to.\n\nThe 「で」 in 「では」 is not the particle 「で」, but the auxiliary verb 「だ」 in its conjunctive form. 「は」 is regularly dropped from 「では」 expressions, or it may also be changed to 「じゃ」 for ease of pronunciation.\n\nThe conjunction particle 「て」 should follow 「なく」, as it is the conjunctive form of the い-Adjective 「ない」. However, the 「て」 in this particular construction is very often omitted.\n\nIn writing, if there is no comma (読点) after 「なく」, the full 「なくて」 construction will be required. When a comma is present, both forms are grammatically correct.",
