meaning: Indicates that an action or state did not occur in the past, used in polite contexts.
meaning_warning: When a past negative sentence has a connection with the present, for example, something
  was expected to happen but has not happened for the moment, the Verb[て] + いません construction is used
  instead.
pronunciation:
  katakana: マセンデシタ
  romaji: masendeshita
formation:
  Verb (masu-stem) + ませんでした: Forms the polite negative past tense for all verb types.
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  usage-context: general use
  function: To state that an action or state did not occur in the past in a polite manner.
  grammatical-role: Combines negation with past tense for verbs.
etymology: The polite form ませんでした developed from the negative polite form ません combined with the past auxiliary
  でした. This structure effectively combines the negation of an action with its completion in the past,
  providing a polite way to state that an action or state did not occur.
writeup: |-
  The polite past negative form, **〜ませんでした**, is used to express that an action or state did not occur in the past. It is formed by taking the ます-stem of any verb and attaching ませんでした.

  For example:
  *   **読む (yomu)** (to read) -> 読みます (yomimasu) -> 読みませんでした (yomimasendeshita - didn't read).
  *   **食べる (taberu)** (to eat) -> 食べます (tabemasu) -> 食べませんでした (tabemasendeshita - didn't eat).
  *   **する (suru)** (to do) -> します (shimasu) -> しませんでした (shimasendeshita - didn't do).
  *   **来る (kuru)** (to come) -> 来ます (kimasu) -> 来ませんでした (kimasendeshita - didn't come).

  This form is highly versatile and can be used in a wide range of polite contexts, from formal business settings to respectful everyday conversations. It directly states that an action was not performed or a state did not exist at a particular time in the past.

  An important exception to note is the verb **ある (aru)**, meaning "to exist" for inanimate objects. While its casual negative past form is irregular (なかった), its polite negative past form follows the regular ます-stem rule: **ありませんでした** (arimasendeshita - there wasn't/weren't).
false_friends:
  - term: まだ～ていません
    meaning: have not done
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike Verb[ませんでした] which states an action definitively did not occur in the past, まだ～ていません
      implies a state of non-completion or non-occurrence that extends from the past up to the present
      moment, or an action that has not yet been completed.
    grammar_point: まだ～ていない (still uncompleted)
  - term: 〜ませんでしたか
    meaning: Didn't you...?
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While Verb[ませんでした] makes a declarative statement about a past non-occurrence, 〜ませんでしたか is
      a question seeking confirmation or expressing mild surprise that something didn't happen.
    grammar_point: か (question)
  - term: い-Adjective (past negative)
    meaning: Was not, Wasn't (Adjective)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Though it uses the なかった ending in its plain form (e.g., 寒くなかった - wasn't cold), this structure
      applies to i-adjectives to negate a past state of a quality, not to describe the past non-occurrence
      of an action, which Verb[ませんでした] does for verbs.
    grammar_point: い-Adjective (past negative)
  - term: じゃなかった
    meaning: was not (noun/na-adjective)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This form (or ではありませんでした) negates nouns or な-adjectives in the past tense (e.g., 学生じゃなかった
      - wasn't a student; 静かじゃなかった - wasn't quiet). It describes a past state of being 'not something'
      or 'not a certain quality', which is distinct from Verb[ませんでした] which negates a verb's action.
    grammar_point: じゃなかった (was not)
post_false_friends_writeup: The key to distinguishing **〜ませんでした** from similar-sounding or conceptually
  related forms lies in the part of speech it modifies and the nuance of completion or duration. **〜ませんでした**
  is strictly for verbs, indicating a simple, completed non-occurrence in the past. In contrast, **まだ〜ていません**
  emphasizes a non-completion that persists into the present. Be mindful of the context when encountering
  similar endings like **〜なかった** for i-adjectives or the copula, as their grammatical function and the
  elements they modify are entirely different from verbs.
