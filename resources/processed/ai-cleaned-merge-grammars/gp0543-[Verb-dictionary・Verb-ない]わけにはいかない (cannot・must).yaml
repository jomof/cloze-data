jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  usage-context: Applicable across various situations, from casual conversations to formal contexts
etymology: The expression 「わけにはいかない」 combines 「わけ」 (wake), meaning 'reason' or 'cause,' with the particle
  「に」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and 「いかない」 (ikanai), the negative form of 「行く」 (iku), meaning 'to go.'
  It literally translates to 'it cannot go that way,' implying that a reason or circumstance prevents
  a certain action. When 「ない」 is placed before 「わけにはいかない」 (Verb-ない form + わけにはいかない), it creates a double
  negative, emphasizing the necessity or inevitability of the action, effectively meaning 'cannot not
  do.' This highlights a strong sense of obligation or lack of alternatives.
writeup: |-
  The grammar pattern 「わけにはいかない」 is a versatile expression used to convey that one is unable to do something, or conversely, that one **must** do something. It always implies a strong reason, be it external circumstances, social norms, or an internal sense of obligation.

  When preceded by a verb in its **dictionary form (Verb-dictionary + わけにはいかない)**, it means "cannot afford to do," "no way to do," or "impossible to do." This usage suggests that performing the action would be inappropriate, undesirable, or simply impossible given the speaker's situation or external factors. The emphasis is on the **reason** (わけ) why a certain action is prohibited or cannot be undertaken.

  Conversely, when preceded by a verb in its **negative -ない form (Verb-ない form + わけにはいかない)**, it creates a double negative, meaning "cannot not do," which effectively translates to "must do" or "have no choice but to do." This form emphasizes the necessity or inevitability of the action, often implying that there are specific circumstances or obligations that make avoiding the action impossible. It can sometimes be used to provide an excuse or justification for an action, conveying that one would prefer not to do it but is compelled by circumstances.
false_friends:
  - term: かねる
    meaning: cannot; be unable to; hard to; hesitant to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「かねる」 implies a personal inability or hesitation, often due to social or moral reasons, whereas
      「わけにはいかない」 (cannot afford to) emphasizes external constraints or social obligations that make something
      impossible.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]かねる (unable to・hesitant to)'
  - term: てはいられない
    meaning: can't afford to keep doing; unable to continue
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「てはいられない」 focuses on the urgency or necessity to act, conveying that one cannot continue in
      a certain state or remain inactive. While similar in conveying an inability, 「わけにはいかない」 (cannot
      afford to) highlights the reason behind the inability to do something specific due to external factors.
    grammar_point: てはいられない (cannot afford to)
  - term: ずにはいられない
    meaning: cannot help doing something; cannot resist doing something
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ずにはいられない」 expresses an uncontrollable internal urge or feeling, indicating an action one
      cannot prevent themselves from doing. This contrasts with 「わけにはいかない」 (cannot afford to), which refers
      to external obligations or circumstances preventing an action. While 「ないわけにはいかない」 (must do) also
      implies a strong obligation, 「ずにはいられない」 focuses on an irresistible internal urge.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-ない form]ずにはいられない・ないではいられない (cannot help but do)'
  - term: できない
    meaning: cannot do; unable to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「できない」 states a simple inability to perform an action due to lack of skill, means, or opportunity.
      「わけにはいかない」 (cannot afford to), however, emphasizes that one is unable to do something because of
      strong external constraints, social norms, or a sense of obligation, rather than a mere inability.
    grammar_point: Verb[(ら)れる] (potential)
  - term: てはいけない
    meaning: must not; may not; cannot
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「てはいけない」 is a general prohibition or strong suggestion, often implying a rule or moral imperative.
      In contrast, 「わけにはいかない」 (cannot afford to) specifically conveys an inability to do something due
      to compelling circumstances, social pressure, or a strong sense of duty, rather than a direct command
      not to.
    grammar_point: 〜てはいけない・〜てはならない (must not)
  - term: なければならない
    meaning: must do; have to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「なければならない」 expresses a direct obligation, often externally imposed. While it can convey necessity
      similar to 「ないわけにはいかない」 (must do), 「なければならない」 lacks the specific nuance of a compelling circumstance
      or lack of choice that makes an action unavoidable. In contrast, 「わけにはいかない」 (cannot afford to) indicates
      an inability to do something due to external circumstances or social expectations, which is a different
      emphasis than a direct obligation to act.
    grammar_point: ~なければならない・なきゃ (must do・have to)
  - term: てならない
    meaning: Very, Extremely, Can't help but do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「てならない」 expresses strong emotion or feeling, while 「ないわけにはいかない」 (must do) indicates a strong
      obligation or lack of choice due to circumstances.
    grammar_point: てたまらない・てならない・て仕方がない・てしょうがない (unbearably・cannot help but)
  - term: なくはない
    meaning: It's not that…, kind of, might, slightly, somewhat, in some respects
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「なくはない」 expresses a possibility or a weak affirmation (e.g., 'it's not impossible'), while
      「ないわけにはいかない」 (must do) indicates certainty and obligation (e.g., 'it's unavoidable').
    grammar_point: なくはない (softened possibility)
  - term: ざるを得ない
    meaning: can't help doing, have no choice but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Both 「ざるを得ない」 and 「ないわけにはいかない」 (must do) express a lack of choice. However, 「ざるを得ない」 is generally
      more formal than 「ないわけにはいかない」 and often implies resignation to an unavoidable situation, while 「ないわけにはいかない」
      can also be used to provide justification for an action.
    grammar_point: ざるを得ない (have no choice but to)
  - term: ないといけない
    meaning: must do, have to do (colloquial)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ないといけない」 is a colloquial expression for obligation, similar to 「なければならない」. Unlike 「ないわけにはいかない」
      (must do), it lacks the specific sense of inevitability or 'cannot not do' that comes from compelling
      reasons or strong justification.
    grammar_point: ないといけない (must do・have to)
  - term: よりほかない
    meaning: have no choice but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「よりほかない」 and 「ないわけにはいかない」 (must do) convey having no other option, 「よりほかない」 often
      emphasizes resignation to the only remaining action among limited choices. In contrast, 「ないわけにはいかない」
      implies a more active, unavoidable obligation due to prevailing circumstances, and can also be used
      to provide an excuse or justification.
    grammar_point: よりほかない・よりしかたがない (no choice but)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「わけにはいかない」 (cannot afford to) focuses on
  external reasons or social norms preventing an action. Conversely, 「ないわけにはいかない」 (must do) means you
  have no choice but to do something. 「かねる」 expresses personal inability or reluctance due to social considerations.
  「てはいられない」 emphasizes urgency and the inability to maintain a current state. 「ずにはいられない」 conveys an irresistible
  internal urge. Simple inability is expressed by 「できない」. 「てはいけない」 indicates a direct prohibition. 「なければならない」
  conveys a direct obligation to act. 「てならない」 expresses a strong feeling. 「なくはない」 suggests a weak possibility.
  「ざるを得ない」 and 「よりほかない」 both imply having no choice, but 「ないわけにはいかない」 often includes a stronger sense
  of personal justification or inevitability due to circumstances.

        english: As I was in a position to be a role model for new employees, I hesitated to do sloppy
          work.
        hint: '「かねる」 (past: かねました) implies personal hesitation or inability. 「わけにはいかなかった」 emphasizes the
          strong professional obligation. We''re looking for an expression that indicates the role prevented

        english: As I was in a position to be a role model for new employees, I couldn't afford to keep
          doing sloppy work.
        hint: 「てはいられませんでした」 focuses on the urgency not to continue a state. We're looking for an expression
          that indicates a specific action was impossible due to the role.

        english: As I was in a position to be a role model for new employees, I could not help but do
          sloppy work.
        hint: 「ずにはいられませんでした」 expresses an uncontrollable internal urge to do something, which contradicts
          being unable to do sloppy work. We're looking for an expression that indicates being externally
          prevented from doing sloppy work.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新入 社員 の 手本 と なる べき 立場 な の で、いい 加減 な 仕事 を {でき ませ ん でし た}。
        english: As I was in a position to be a role model for new employees, I couldn't do sloppy work.
        hint: 「できませんでした」 is a simple statement of inability, not conveying the sense of professional obligation
          or the strong reason that made sloppy work unacceptable. We're looking for an expression that
          indicates the role prevented sloppy work.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 新入 社員 の 手本 と なる べき 立場 な の で、いい 加減 な 仕事 を する {べき で は なかっ た}。
        english: As I was in a position to be a role model for new employees, I should not have done sloppy
          work.
        hint: This expresses a judgment about what *should* have been done, while the grammar point states
          what *could not* be done due to responsibility. We're looking for an expression that indicates
          the role prevented sloppy work.
    scene: A senior employee explaining to a mentee why they always maintained high standards.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: negative past polite (～ませんでした)
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The polite past form 「わけにはいきませんでした」 conveys a strong sense of past inevitability or impossibility,
      reflecting on a situation where failure was simply not an option given prior circumstances. The
      phrasing 「新入 社員 の 手本 と なる べき 立場」 (a position where one should be a role model) clearly articulates
      the sense of responsibility that made sloppy work unacceptable.
  - english: Because there's an important meeting today, I can't afford to take time off, even if I'm
      feeling unwell.
    japanese:
      - 今日 は 大事 な 会議 が ある から、具合 が 悪く て も {休め ない わけ に は いか ない}。
      - 今日 は 大事 な 会議 が ある から、具合 が 悪く て も {休め ない わけ に は いき ませ ん}。
    english_literally: Because there's an important meeting today, even if I'm feeling unwell, it's not
      that I can't not take time off.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{休む べき で は ない}'
        english: I shouldn't take time off.
        hint: This implies a choice or a moral judgment, not a strong, external obligation that overrides
          personal health. We're looking for an expression that conveys 'no way to avoid' due to compelling
          external circumstances.
      - competing_japanese:
          - '{休ん で は いけ ない}'
        english: I mustn't take time off.
        hint: This implies a prohibition, not a compelling circumstance. The original expression captures
          the impossibility of taking time off due to the compelling situation. We're looking for an expression
          that means 'no way to avoid' due to external reasons.
    scene: An employee telling their spouse why they have to go to work.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: 「休めないわけにはいきません」 is in the polite form, showing respect to the listener. Being sick 「具合が悪い」
      is a valid reason not to come, but in this circumstance, the person still needs to attend, emphasizing
      the strong obligation in a professional setting.
  - english: I promised my younger sister I'd play with her, so I can't go out and play right now.
    japanese:
      - 妹 と 遊ぶ 約束 を し た から、今 から 遊び に 行く {わけ に は いか ない}。
      - 妹 と 遊ぶ 約束 を し た から、今 から 遊び に 行く {わけ に は いか ない} よ。
      - 妹 と 遊ぶ 約束 を し た から、今 から 遊び に 行く {わけ に は いか ない} ん です。

      play from now.

        english: Since I promised to play with my younger sister, I must not go out and play right now.

          you *cannot* do something.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: Since I promised to play with my younger sister, I hesitate to go out and play right
          now.
        hint: 「かねる」 implies a personal hesitation or inability. 「わけにはいかない」 emphasizes the strong obligation
          due to a personal promise. We're looking for an expression that indicates a commitment prevents
          the action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 妹 と 遊ぶ 約束 を し た から、今 から 遊び に 行っ {て は い られ ない}。
        english: Since I promised to play with my younger sister, I can't afford to keep going out and
          playing right now.
        hint: 「てはいられない」 focuses on the urgency not to continue a state. We're looking for an expression
          that indicates a specific action is currently impossible due to a commitment.

        english: Since I promised to play with my younger sister, I cannot help but go out and play right
          now.
        hint: 「ずにはいられない」 expresses an uncontrollable internal urge to do something, which contradicts
          being unable to go out. We're looking for an expression that indicates being prevented by a
          promise.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今 から 遊び に {行け ない}。
        english: I can't go out and play right now.
        hint: This is a simple statement of inability, not conveying the strong sense of obligation or
          personal commitment that makes the action inappropriate. We're looking for an expression that
          indicates a commitment prevents the action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今 から 遊び に 行か {ない 方 が いい}。
        english: It's better not to go out and play right now.
        hint: This suggests a personal choice or recommendation, whereas the grammar point implies an
          unavoidable obligation. We're looking for an expression that indicates a commitment prevents
          the action.
    scene: A child telling a friend why they can't join them for playtime.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker uses a casual tone, indicated by the plain form 「わけにはいかない」 and optionally the
      particle 「よ」, common among boys. The phrase highlights a personal commitment 「約束 を し た」 (made a
      promise) as the strong reason preventing the action of going out to play.
  - english: I'm well aware you're busy, but I simply cannot not invite you for a drink tonight.
    japanese:
      - お 忙しい こと は よく 分かっ て い ます が、あなた を 今夜 の 飲み に お 誘い {し ない わけ に は いか ない}。
      - お 忙しい こと は よく 分かっ て い ます が、あなた を 今夜 の 飲み に お 誘い {し ない わけ に は いき ませ ん}。
    english_literally: I am well aware you are busy, but it's not that I can't not invite you for a drink
      tonight.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - お 誘い {し なけれ ば なり ませ ん}
        english: I must invite you.
        hint: This sounds like a mere obligation, lacking the 'irresistible urge' nuance present in the
          original expression. The flirty setting implies a strong, almost unavoidable personal desire.
          We're looking for an expression that conveys an unavoidable desire.
      - competing_japanese:
          - お 誘い {し たい です}
        english: I want to invite you.
        hint: This is too blunt and less subtle for a flirty, business context. The original expression
          conveys the invitation more artfully than a simple declaration of intent. We're looking for
          an expression that frames the invitation as an unavoidable necessity.
    scene: An older man (boss) talking to a younger female employee after work hours.
    register: bijinesu nihongo (business)
    setting: flirty
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「よく分かっていますが」 and the polite 「お誘いしないわけにはいきません」 makes the invitation formal and persistent.
      This can be seen as charmingly persistent in a flirty context. The older male, using respectful
      language, subtly implies an irresistible urge to invite her, framing it as an unavoidable necessity.
  - english: As a public servant, I cannot accept expensive gifts from citizens.
    japanese:
      - 公務 員 です から、国民 から 高価 な 贈り物 を 受け取る {わけ に は いき ませ ん}。

        english: As a public servant, I must not accept expensive gifts from citizens.
        hint: 「ないわけにはいきません」 means you *must* do something. We're looking for an expression that indicates
          you *cannot* do something.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: As a public servant, I hesitate to accept expensive gifts from citizens.
        hint: 「かねる」 implies personal hesitation or inability. 「わけにはいかない」 emphasizes the strong professional
          obligation and ethical guideline. We're looking for an expression that indicates professional
          duty prevents the action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 公務 員 です から、国民 から 高価 な 贈り物 を 受け取っ {て は い られ ませ ん}。
        english: As a public servant, I can't afford to keep accepting expensive gifts from citizens.
        hint: 「てはいられません」 focuses on the urgency not to continue a state. We're looking for an expression
          that indicates a specific action is currently impossible due to professional ethics.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 公務 員 です から、国民 から 高価 な 贈り物 を 受け取ら {ず に は い られ ませ ん}。
        english: As a public servant, I cannot help but accept expensive gifts from citizens.
        hint: 「ずにはいられません」 expresses an uncontrollable internal urge to do something, which contradicts
          being unable to accept gifts. We're looking for an expression that indicates being prevented
          by professional rules.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 国民 から 高価 な 贈り物 を {受け取れ ませ ん}。
        english: I cannot accept expensive gifts from citizens.
        hint: This is a simple statement of inability, not conveying the strong sense of professional
          obligation or ethical rule that makes the action inappropriate. We're looking for an expression
          that indicates professional duty prevents the action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 国民 から 高価 な 贈り物 を 受け取る {べき で は あり ませ ん}。
        english: I should not accept expensive gifts from citizens.
        hint: This suggests a moral or recommended action, while the grammar point indicates an unavoidable
          prohibition due to one's role. We're looking for an expression that indicates professional duty
          prevents the action.
    scene: A public servant explaining ethical conduct to a new colleague.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The speaker, a female public servant, uses the polite form 「わけにはいきません」, suitable for a professional
      and informative setting. The phrase 「公務員 です から」 (because I am a public servant) emphasizes that
      the inability to accept gifts stems from their professional role and ethical guidelines, which are
      strong external constraints.
  - english: Today's meeting feels just like fate. I simply cannot not see you again, can I?
    japanese:
      - 今日 の 出会い は、まるで 運命 の よう。もう 二 度 と あなた に {会わ ない わけ に は いか ない} ね。
      - 今日 の 出会い は、まるで 運命 の よう。もう 二 度 と あなた に {会わ ない わけ に は いき ませ ん} ね。
    english_literally: Today's encounter is just like fate. It's not that I can't not see you again, is
      it?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - もう 一 度 {会い たい です}
        english: I want to see you again.
        hint: This is too blunt and lacks the romantic inevitability implied by 'fate.' The original expression
          expresses it as an unavoidable consequence of the strong connection. We're looking for an expression
          that conveys an unavoidable desire.
      - competing_japanese:
          - また {会わ なけれ ば なり ませ ん}
        english: I must see you again.
        hint: This sounds like a chore or a strict duty, not romantic. The original expression expresses
          it as an unavoidable consequence of the strong connection. We're looking for an expression that
          portrays seeing the person again as a romantic inevitability.
    scene: At the end of a first meeting that went exceptionally well, implying a strong connection.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: first-date
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The phrase 「まるで運命のよう」 (just like fate) explicitly sets a romantic tone. The speaker, a younger
      female, uses 「もう二度とあなたに会わないわけにはいきませんね」 which expresses an unavoidable desire to meet again. The
      ending particle 「ね」 softens the statement, making it sound more like an intimate observation or
      a shared realization than a forceful demand.
  - english: Yesterday, even though I felt terrible with a cold, I couldn't avoid going to work because
      there was an important meeting.
    japanese:
      - 昨日、風邪 で 辛かっ た けど、大事 な 会議 が あっ た から、出勤 {し ない わけ に は いか なかっ た}。
      - 昨日、風邪 で 辛かっ た けど、大事 な 会議 が あっ た から、出勤 {し ない わけ に は いき ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: Yesterday, although I was having a tough time with a cold, because there was an
      important meeting, it's not that I couldn't not go to work.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 出勤 {し なけれ ば なら なかっ た}
        english: I had to go to work.
        hint: This focuses on a general obligation rather than the personal struggle and the external,
          compelling circumstance (important meeting) that made coming to work unavoidable despite being
          sick. We're looking for an expression that conveys 'no way to avoid' due to specific compelling
          reasons.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 出勤 {する しか なかっ た}
        english: While similar, this often implies a complete lack of alternatives. The original expression
          still carries the nuance of reluctance and an underlying reason why the negative action (not
          going) was impossible.
        hint: While similar, this often implies a complete lack of alternatives. The original expression
          still carries the nuance of reluctance and an underlying reason why the negative action (not
          going) was impossible. We're looking for an expression that implies 'could not not do' due to
          specific circumstances.
    scene: An employee explaining to a colleague why they came to work sick.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The phrase 「風邪で辛かったけど」 expresses the speaker's physical discomfort, highlighting the specific
      circumstance that made going to work difficult. However, the external factor of 「大事な会議」 (important
      meeting) made it impossible to avoid. The older male speaks in a semi-formal tone to a female colleague,
      justifying his presence despite illness.
post_example_writeup: The usage of 「わけにはいかない」 always implies a strong reason—be it social obligation,
  external circumstance, or an internal sense of duty—that makes an action impossible or highly inappropriate.
  Similarly, 「ないわけにはいかない」 highlights a compelling reason that makes an action unavoidable. Both are nuanced
  expressions conveying more than a simple inability or obligation.
