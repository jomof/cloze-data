    "etymology": "The word 「また」 originates from 「亦」, an old kanji meaning 'also' or 'again.' Over time, the hiragana form became the predominant form in everyday usage.",
    "writeup": "「また」, often written as 「又」 in kanji, is a highly versatile expression in Japanese that primarily conveys the sense of **repetition** or **addition**. It can function as both an adverb and a conjunction, allowing for flexibility in its application.\n\nWhen used to express **repetition**, 「また」 is typically translated as \"again\" or \"re-\" in English. It signifies that an action or event is occurring once more, often the same action as a previous one. For example, if you say 「また会う」, it means \"meet again.\"\n\nIn its role as a **conjunction**, 「また」 introduces supplementary information, an alternative, or another similar item. Here, it functions much like \"also,\" \"in addition,\" \"furthermore,\" or \"moreover.\" The action or state described may be different but is related to a previously stated one, or it adds another perspective. For instance, in a sentence like 「彼は医者だ。また、音楽家でもある。」 (He is a doctor. Also, he is a musician.), 「また」 introduces additional information about the same person.\n\nAs a conjunction, 「また」 can begin a sentence, provided that the sentence conveys a complete thought and logically extends or adds to the preceding statement. It implies a logical connection between what precedes it and what follows, whether that connection is a straightforward repetition or the inclusion of related, yet distinct, information.\n\nAn important usage to note is with the particle 「は」, forming 「または」. This explicitly means \"or\" and is used to present clear alternatives, often in more formal or written contexts, though it can appear in speech too. For example, 「コーヒーまたは紅茶」 means \"coffee or tea.\"",
