    "writeup": "「また」 is used to indicate repetition or addition. It can function as an adverb or a conjunction, signifying 'again,' 'also,' 'moreover,' or 'additionally.' Think of it as indicating a repetition of an action or state. The nuance can vary depending on the context: it can mean doing the same thing again, or it can introduce something in addition to what was previously mentioned. As a conjunction, a sentence can begin with 「また」, provided the sentence expresses a complete thought.",
