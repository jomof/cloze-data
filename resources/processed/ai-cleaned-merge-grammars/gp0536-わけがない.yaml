    "writeup": "The grammar point 「わけがない」 is used to express a strong negation, impossibility, or lack of reason for something to be true. It conveys a sense of \"there's no way,\" \"there's no reason,\" or \"it's impossible.\" 「わけ」 functions similarly to \"so\" in English for emphasis. 「わけがない」 is stronger than 「わけではない」, emphasizing the complete non-existence or impossibility of something. It's akin to saying \"It is SO not (A)\" rather than just \"It is not (A)\".",
    "etymology": "「わけ」 means reason or cause. 「ない」 means not exist. So, literally, 「わけがない」 means \"there is no reason\". This implies a strong negation or impossibility.",
