    "writeup": "The grammar point 「わけがない」 expresses a strong sense of impossibility or denial. It conveys the meaning that \"there is no way that (A)\" or \"it is impossible that (A).\" Think of 「わけ」 as being similar to \"so\" in English for emphasis. Therefore, 「わけがない」 can be interpreted as \"it is SO not (A)\".\n\nIt is crucial to note the strength of 「わけがない」 compared to 「わけではない」. The former strongly emphasizes the non-existence of something, similar to the difference between \"it is so that it isn't (A)\" (for 「わけではない」) and \"it is SO not (A)\" (for 「わけがない」).",
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「わけがない」 comes from 「わけ」 (wake), which means reason or cause, 「が」 (ga), a particle, and 「ない」 (nai), meaning \"not.\" Thus, literally, it means \"there is no reason\" or \"there is no cause,\" which evolves to imply impossibility.",
