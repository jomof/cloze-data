    "etymology": "The word 「反面 (hanmen)」 literally means \"opposite side\" or \"reverse side.\" It comes from 「反 (han)」 meaning \"opposite\" or \"reverse\" and 「面 (men)」 meaning \"side\" or \"aspect.\" Therefore, the grammar point uses the literal meaning of the word to indicate contrasting aspects.",
    "writeup": "「反面 (hanmen)」 is a grammatical construction used to present two contrasting or opposing features of a single person, thing, or situation. It often translates to \"while,\" \"on the other hand,\" or \"although.\" The essence of 「反面」 is to highlight a duality, typically presenting a positive aspect alongside a negative one, or vice-versa. It is crucial to note that 「反面」 is not used to describe two positive or two negative aspects; it specifically implies a contradiction or trade-off.\n\nBeing a noun, 「反面」 can be used after: \n*   Verbs (in their plain non-past form)\n*   い-adjectives (in their plain non-past form)\n*   な-adjectives (followed by 「な」 or 「である」)\n*   Nouns (followed by 「である」)\n\nThis structure allows for a nuanced expression of complex realities where benefits often come with drawbacks, or positive traits are accompanied by negative ones within the same subject.",
