        "usage-context": "Used to connect two contrasting or opposing features of a single subject (person, thing, or situation). It highlights a duality, typically presenting a positive aspect alongside a negative one, or vice-versa. It cannot be used to describe two positive or two negative aspects.",
        "function": "To express a contrasting aspect of the same subject.",
        "nuance": "Implies a strong contradiction or trade-off where the positive aspect inherently leads to or exists alongside a negative aspect, or vice-versa. It emphasizes that these are two sides of the same coin, often with an underlying sense of bittersweetness or inherent challenge. It specifically implies a contradiction or trade-off, differentiating it from expressions that simply present another side.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a connective that introduces a contrasting clause or phrase."
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「反面 (hanmen)」 literally translates to \"opposite side\" or \"reverse aspect.\" It is composed of the kanji 「反 (han)」, meaning \"opposite\" or \"reverse,\" and 「面 (men)」, meaning \"side\" or \"aspect.\" This direct, literal meaning is reflected in its grammatical function, where it serves to highlight the contrasting or contradictory aspects of a single entity or situation. Its usage evolved to concisely express the duality inherent in many concepts or phenomena, emphasizing the two differing 'faces' of the same subject.",
    "writeup": "「反面 (hanmen)」 is a grammatical construction used to present two contrasting or opposing features of a single person, thing, or situation. It frequently translates to \"while,\" \"on the other hand,\" or \"although.\" The core function of 「反面」 is to highlight a duality, typically presenting a positive aspect alongside a negative one, or vice-versa. It is crucial to understand that 「反面」 is specifically used for expressing contradictions and is not suitable for describing two exclusively positive or two exclusively negative aspects of the same subject; it implies a trade-off or an inherent opposition.\n\nAs a noun, 「反面」 connects to various word types:\n*   **Verbs** (in their plain non-past form): For example, 「する反面 (suru hanmen - while doing)」, 「できない反面 (dekinai hanmen - while unable to do)」.\n*   **い-adjectives** (in their plain non-past form): For example, 「高い反面 (takai hanmen - while expensive)」, 「美味しくない反面 (oishikunai hanmen - while not delicious)」.\n*   **な-adjectives** (followed by 「な」 or 「である」): For example, 「便利な反面 (benri na hanmen - while convenient)」 for casual contexts, or 「便利である反面 (benri de aru hanmen - while convenient)」 for more formal or explanatory situations.\n*   **Nouns** (followed by 「である」): For example, 「学生である反面 (gakusei de aru hanmen - while being a student)」.\n\nThis structure enables a nuanced expression of complex realities where benefits often come with drawbacks, or positive traits are accompanied by negative ones within the same subject. It emphasizes that these contrasting elements are inherent to the same entity, creating a sense of balance in the observation.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「に対して」 is typically used to compare two *different* entities or subjects, or to express an opposing action or feeling towards something. It emphasizes contrast between distinct elements rather than opposing aspects within a single one, which is the core function of 「反面」."

            "nuance": "「一方で」 can indicate contrasting or simultaneous aspects, but it is broader than 「反面」. It can introduce another aspect or viewpoint without necessarily implying a strong contradiction or a negative consequence directly stemming from a positive attribute. While it can show contrast, it doesn't always carry the same emphasis on inherent opposition within *one* subject as 「反面」 does."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When distinguishing between 「反面」, 「に対して」, and 「一方で」, consider the nature of the contrast. Use 「反面」 when you want to highlight two *inherently opposing or contradictory characteristics* of the *same thing or situation*. For instance, a job might be challenging but also highly rewarding. Use 「に対して」 when comparing or contrasting *two separate entities or ideas*. For example, comparing city life to rural life. Use 「一方で」 for presenting *another side* or a *simultaneous aspect*, which might be contrasting but doesn't necessarily imply the strong, inherent contradiction that 「反面」 conveys. It's more versatile and less specific to a direct positive-negative trade-off within a single subject.",
