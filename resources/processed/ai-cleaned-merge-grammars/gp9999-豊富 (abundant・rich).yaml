jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: adjective
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used to describe a large quantity, variety, or richness of something, often implying
    a positive or desirable state. Commonly applied to resources, knowledge, experience, nature, etc.
  function: To qualify or describe something as being plentiful, ample, or rich in a particular aspect.
  nuance: Implies a fullness or ample supply, often with a positive connotation. It is generally used
    for tangible or quantifiable things, as well as abstract concepts like knowledge or experience.
  colocation: Often collocates with words related to nature (自然), resources (資源), knowledge (知識), experience
    (経験), nutrients (栄養), ideas (アイデア), ingredients (食材), etc.
etymology: The word 豊富 (ほうふ) is a compound kanji word. 豊 (ほう/ゆたか) means 'abundant,' 'plentiful,' or 'rich,'
  evoking a sense of fullness or prosperity. 富 (ふ/とむ) means 'wealth,' 'riches,' or 'to be rich.' Together,
  they strongly convey the meaning of 'abundant wealth' or 'richness in supply,' highlighting both quantity
  and quality.
writeup: 豊富 (ほうふ) is a な-adjective (adjectival noun) used to express that something is abundant, rich,
  or plentiful. It can describe a wide range of things, from natural resources and food to abstract concepts
  like knowledge, experience, or ideas. When used as a predicate, it takes the form 「〜が豊富だ」. For instance,
  「日本は自然が豊富だ。」 (Japan is rich in nature.). When directly modifying a noun, it takes the form 「豊富な〜」, such
  as 「豊富な経験」 (abundant experience). While it primarily denotes a large quantity, 豊富 also carries a nuance
  of richness or high quality, making it more descriptive than simply saying 'many' or 'a lot.' It is
  often used in more formal or descriptive contexts, fitting well in academic, business, or journalistic
  writing.

  - term: 多い
    meaning: many, numerous
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「多い」 simply indicates a large number or quantity, without the connotation of richness or variety
      implied by 「豊富」. For example, 人が多い (many people) vs. 資源が豊富だ (abundant resources). We're looking
      for abundance or richness, not just quantity.
    grammar_point: 多い (many・a lot・much)
  - term: 沢山
    meaning: many, a lot
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「多い」, 「沢山」 means 'a lot' or 'many' and is more commonly used in casual speech.
      It lacks the formal nuance and the sense of inherent richness or variety that 「豊富」 conveys. We're
      looking for a word that describes abundance in a rich or plentiful way.
    grammar_point: たくさん (many・a lot)
  - term: 豊か
    meaning: abundant, rich, affluent
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「豊か」 is also a な-adjective meaning 'abundant' or 'rich,' and its nuance is very close to 「豊富」.
      However, 「豊か」 can describe a broader range of 'richness,' including abstract concepts like 'richness
      of heart' (心が豊か) or 'richness of life' (豊かな人生), whereas 「豊富」 more strongly emphasizes an ample supply
      or quantity of something specific. 「豊か」 also implies a state of being well-off or prosperous. 「豊富」
      is about the *presence* of much of something, while 「豊か」 can also be about the *quality* of being
      rich or full.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:豊か (yutaka・abundant)
  - term: 潤沢
    meaning: abundant, flowing, rich (often of fluids or funds)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「潤沢」 is a more formal and somewhat technical term for 'abundant,' often used specifically
      for fluids, funds, or supplies that are flowing freely and in ample amounts. It carries a sense
      of 'smooth, ample supply' or 'liquid abundance,' which is a more specific connotation than the general
      'richness' of 「豊富」. We're looking for general abundance, not specifically liquid or financial.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:潤沢 (juntaku・abundant)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「多い」 and 「沢山」 focus purely on quantity, 「豊富」 goes further to imply a
  richness or ample supply, suggesting a positive quality or variety alongside the large amount. 「豊か」
  is a close synonym, especially when describing a general state of richness or prosperity, including
  abstract concepts. 「潤沢」 is a more specialized term, often used for abundant liquids, funds, or supplies
  that are freely flowing.

post_example_writeup: As illustrated in the examples, 「豊富」 is versatile and can be applied to both concrete
  nouns like ingredients or resources, and abstract concepts such as knowledge or ideas. It highlights
  not just a large quantity but also a sense of richness, variety, or inherent value. Pay attention to
  its use as a な-adjective, either directly modifying a noun with 「豊富な」 or predicatively with 「〜が豊富だ」.
  Understanding its nuance helps distinguish it from simpler quantitative terms like 「多い」 or 「沢山」.
