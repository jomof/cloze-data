        "[Verb in dictionary form] + ことはない": "Indicates that there is no need to do something or that something never happens.",
        "[Noun] + ということはない": "Indicates that something is not the case or that something is not possible."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ことはない」 is composed of 「こと」 (koto), which roughly translates to \"thing\" or \"matter\", the particle 「は」 (wa), which marks the topic, and 「ない」 (nai), meaning \"not\" or \"does not exist\". Together, it literally suggests \"the matter/thing does not exist,\" which evolves into the meaning of \"there is no need\" or \"it never happens.\"",
    "writeup": "「ことはない」 is an expression with two primary uses. It conveys that there is \"no need for (A)\" or that \"(A) never happens.\" (A) is a verb in its dictionary form that appears directly before 「こと」. It is often used to reassure someone that something will not come to pass.\n\nIn this expression, the particle 「は」 functions adverbially, presenting (A) as the extent, while 「ない」 negates that extent. This negation leads to the interpretation of \"There is no (A).\" This implies that (A) is unthinkable or even impossible.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\nThis structure is different from 「たことがない」, which refers to a single instance of something not having happened. 「ことはない」 presents the verb/verb-phrase as a topic in non-past form, highlighting its non-existence. It can also imply that (A) is unthinkable or impossible.",
