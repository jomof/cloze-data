    "etymology": "The expression 「ことはない」 combines the noun 「こと」 (koto), the topic particle 「は」 (wa), and the negative adjective 「ない」 (nai). 「こと」 here refers to an event or action. The particle 「は」 marks it as the topic, and 「ない」 negates its existence, conveying the meaning that 'there is no such event or action' needed or that it never occurs.",
    "writeup": "「ことはない」 is used to express that there is no need to do something or that something never happens. The verb precedes 「こと」, and the entire phrase 「ことはない」 indicates the absence of necessity or possibility. It's often used to reassure someone or to state that something is unnecessary or impossible. The literal meaning is 'There is no (A)', and it can imply that (A) is unthinkable or impossible. Be careful not to confuse this with 「たことがない」, which means 'have never done something'. 「ことはない」 presents the verb as a topic, highlighting its non-existence, while 「たことがない」 refers to a single instance of something not happening.",
