etymology: The word どうぞ (dōzo) is believed to have originated from どうする (dō suru), meaning "how to do"
  or "what to do." Over time, it underwent a euphonic change and evolved into an adverb used to express
  politeness, invitation, or encouragement. It implies a sense of "please do as you wish" or "please go
  ahead," emphasizing the speaker's willingness for the listener to proceed comfortably.
writeup: |-
  どうぞ (dōzo) is a versatile and fundamental Japanese word that serves multiple functions, primarily expressing invitation, offering, or permission. It is inherently polite, making it suitable for a wide range of situations, from formal interactions to casual conversations with a polite nuance.

  Its most common uses include:

  *   **Offering something**: When handing an item to someone, saying 「{どうぞ}」 is akin to saying "here you are" or "please take this."
  *   **Inviting an action**: It can be used to encourage someone to start an action, such as sitting down, entering a room, or eating. For example, 「{どうぞ}、お座りください」 (Please, sit down).
  *   **Giving permission**: It grants permission to the listener, often in response to a request. If someone asks "Can I use this?", a simple 「{どうぞ}」 means "go ahead" or "yes, please do."

  While 「{どうぞ}」 is polite on its own, it often appears with other polite forms, particularly the te-form of verbs followed by 「{どうぞ}」 or polite requests like 「〜ください」 to add an extra layer of deference and hospitality. Its use softens direct requests and makes interactions smoother and more agreeable.

  - term: ください (please give me)
    meaning: please give me
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「{どうぞ}」 is an offering or an invitation from the speaker to the listener ("Here you are,"
      "Please go ahead"). In contrast, 「{ください}」 is a direct request from the listener to the speaker,
      asking for an object ("Please give me X").
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Nounをください (please give me)
  - term: Verb[て]ください (please do)
    meaning: please do (a verb)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both can involve an action, 「{どうぞ}」 (often with the te-form of a verb) is an invitation
      or granting of permission to do something (e.g., 「座って{どうぞ}」 - "Please sit down, go ahead"). It emphasizes
      the speaker's willingness. 「〜てください」 is a direct, polite command or request for an action (e.g.,
      「座ってください」 - "Please sit down"). It emphasizes the action to be performed by the listener.
    grammar_point: てください (polite request)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate, remember that 「{どうぞ}」 initiates an action or offering from
  the speaker's side, suggesting "go ahead," while 「{ください}」 is a request, asking the listener to perform
  an action or provide an item. Think of 「{どうぞ}」 as giving permission, and 「{ください}」 as asking for something.

    register: formal
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: male

    nuance: 「{どうぞ}お構いなく」 (dōzo okamainaku) is a set phrase meaning "please don't trouble yourself" or
      "please don't bother." It's a polite way to decline an offer of help, emphasizing the speaker's
      desire for the other person not to go out of their way.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 「{どうぞ}」 can stand alone or be combined with verbs (especially
  in the te-form) and other expressions to convey a spectrum of invitations and permissions. Its core
  function is to facilitate polite and hospitable interaction, making the listener feel welcome and at
  ease.
