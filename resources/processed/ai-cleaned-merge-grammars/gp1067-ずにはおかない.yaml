    "etymology": "「ずにはおかない」 is derived from the classical negative auxiliary verb 「ず」, the particle 「に」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and the negated form of the verb 「措く」 (おく), meaning 'to set aside' or 'to leave as is'. The combination expresses the idea that one cannot leave something undone, thus conveying a strong sense of determination or inevitability.",
    "writeup": "「ずにはおかない」 expresses a strong determination that something **will definitely happen** or that you **will not fail to do something**. It implies that you will not give up until the action is completed. 「ずにはおかない」 is a formal expression that literally means \"I cannot leave it as it is with (A) undone\".\n\nYou can replace 「ず」 with 「ないでは」, but the meaning remains the same. This grammar point often appears with causative verbs, indicating a determination to make someone do something.",
