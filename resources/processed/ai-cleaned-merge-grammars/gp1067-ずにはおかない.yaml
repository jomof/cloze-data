    "etymology": "「ずにはおかない」 is derived from classical Japanese grammar, combining 「ず」 (negative auxiliary verb), 「に」 (case-marking particle), 「は」 (adverbial particle), and the negative form of 「措く」 (おく), meaning 'to set aside' or 'leave as is'. The phrase literally means 'cannot leave it as is without doing (A),' thus implying a strong will or certainty about completing an action.",
    "writeup": "「ずにはおかない」 expresses a strong determination that something **will definitely** happen or that someone **will not fail** to do something. It is a formal expression. A close synonym is 「ないではおかない」, with essentially no difference in meaning.\n\n*   It conveys the sense that the speaker will not give up until something is done.\n*   Often used with causative verbs, indicating a determination to make someone do something.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   This grammar point is generally used in formal writing and speech.",
