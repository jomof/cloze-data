jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  function: Conjunctive form; connects clauses.
  grammatical-role: Connects clauses; can indicate sequence, reason, or manner.
  logical-flow: Implies sequential occurrence, causal relationship, or a combined description.
  temporal-flow: The event/state in the first clause precedes or causes the event/state in the second
    clause.
  spatial-flow: Not applicable
etymology: The 「〜て」 form originates from the 連用形 (ren'yōkei, continuative form) of verbs and い-adjectives,
  historically used to connect clauses. It evolved to indicate a sequence of actions, reasons, or states,
  linking them together in a cohesive manner. The 「〜で」 form, used with な-adjectives and nouns, is derived
  from the て-form of the copula 「だ」, signifying a state or condition that precedes the following clause.
  This derivation is essential for understanding why nouns and な-adjectives behave similarly here.
writeup: |-
  The 「〜て」 form is a fundamental grammatical construction in Japanese used to connect clauses, functioning in ways similar to "and" or "because" in English. While the grammar point's title refers to "Adjective[て]", its application extends to both い-adjectives and な-adjectives, as well as nouns. It is a very common and versatile grammatical form used across all registers of Japanese, from casual conversations to formal writing.

  **Formation Rules:**
  *   **For い-adjectives:** Drop the final 「い」 and attach 「くて」. For example, 「新しい」 becomes 「新しくて」. A notable exception is 「いい」 (good), which irregularly becomes 「よくて」, not 「いくて」.
  *   **For な-adjectives and Nouns:** Attach 「で」 directly. For example, 「静かだ」 becomes 「静かで」, and 「学生だ」 becomes 「学生で」. This 「で」 is actually the te-form of the copula 「だ」, indicating a preceding state or condition.

  **Core Meanings and Usage:**

  1.  **Linking (And):** This is the most common and straightforward use, joining two attributes, states, or consecutive actions. The connected clauses usually describe qualities of the same subject or closely related events in sequence.
      *   Example: 「この本は**新しくて面白い**。」(This book is new and interesting.)

  2.  **Reasons/Causes (Because):** The first clause, ending in 「〜くて」 or 「〜で」, acts as a reason or cause for the state or action described in the second clause. This usage implies a direct causal relationship between the two parts.

  **Important Considerations:**
  *   **Context is Key:** The precise meaning (linking vs. reason) is heavily dependent on the context and the logical relationship between the two clauses.
  *   **Implied "Manner":** While not a direct primary meaning for adjectives like it is for verbs, the te-form can sometimes indirectly suggest the manner in which an action occurs if the adjective describes a state influencing that action. However, for adjectives, this is less explicit than with verbal te-forms.

  - term: し〜し
    meaning: And, Giving reasons
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「し〜し」 can also list reasons or conditions, it often implies a more exhaustive or argumentative
      listing of points, and can be used to list multiple, sometimes less directly related, reasons. In
      contrast, 「〜くて/〜で」 often indicates a more direct and cohesive connection, especially for causal
      relationships or inherent qualities, presenting them as a single combined reason.
    grammar_point: し〜し (and; listing reasons)
  - term: ので
    meaning: Because, so, since, the reason being
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「〜ので」 also expresses a reason, it places more emphasis on the objective nature or logical
      consequence of the reason. 「〜くて/〜で」 can sometimes carry a more subjective or inherent quality of
      the preceding clause as the cause, and it can also simply link attributes without a strong causal
      implication.
    grammar_point: ので (reason)
  - term: から
    meaning: Because, since
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜から」 is a general particle for stating reasons, often used for personal justifications or
      direct commands. 「〜くて/〜で」 forms a tighter grammatical bond, embedding the reason directly into the
      sentence structure, making it feel more integrated, especially when linking attributes or inherent
      qualities.
    grammar_point: から (reason cause)
post_false_friends_writeup: The primary distinction among these related forms lies in the nuance of connection
  they convey. While 「〜くて/〜で」 offers a seamless and often causal link by directly integrating the adjective/noun
  into the reason, 「し〜し」 is more about enumerating several distinct reasons or items. 「〜から」 and 「〜ので」
  are general conjunctions for reasons, with 「〜ので」 being more objective and formal, and 「〜から」 often used
  for personal reasons or commands. Selecting the appropriate form depends on the specific relationship,
  emphasis, and level of formality you intend between the clauses.
examples:
  - english: This cat is small and cute.
    japanese:
      - この 猫 は {小さく て} 可愛い です。
      - この 猫、{小さく て} 可愛い。
      - この 猫 ちゃん、{小さく て} 可愛い わ よ。
    english_literally: This cat, small and cute, is.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 猫 は 小さい です。可愛い です。
        english: This cat is small. It is cute.
        hint: Using two separate sentences like 「小さいです。可愛いです。」 breaks the flow and doesn't emphasize the
          combined qualities of the cat. We're looking for a smooth connection of attributes.
    scene: You are enthusiastically describing a new pet to a close friend.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: This is a simple descriptive statement using 「です」 for politeness. The い-adjectives 「小さい」 (small)
      and 「可愛い」 (cute) are linked using 「〜くて」, describing two qualities of the cat. The variations show
      how politeness markers like 「です」 can be dropped in casual settings, and the addition of 「〜ちゃん」 and
      「〜わよ」 can add a feminine, warm nuance.
  - english: Her room is clean and quiet.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 の 部屋 は {綺麗 で} 静か です。
      - 彼女 の 部屋 は {綺麗 で} 静か だ。
      - 彼女 の 部屋、{綺麗 で} 静か だ よ。
    english_literally: Her room, clean and quiet, is.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 の 部屋 は 綺麗 です。静か です。
        english: Her room is clean. It is quiet.
        hint: Separate sentences like 「綺麗です。静かです。」 would make the description sound disjointed. We're
          looking for a smooth connection of attributes.
    scene: You are describing a mutual acquaintance's room to another friend, highlighting its positive
      aspects.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: The な-adjectives 「綺麗」 (clean) and 「静か」 (quiet) are linked with 「〜で」. The polite 「です」 maintains
      a general informative tone suitable for a conversation between friends. Casual forms like 「〜だ」 and
      「〜だ よ」 offer direct, less formal alternatives, suitable for closer acquaintances.
  - english: He is a university student and works part-time.
    japanese:

          - 彼 は 大学 生 です。アルバイト を し て い ます。
        english: He is a university student. He works part-time.
        hint: Using two separate sentences like 「大学生です。アルバイトをしています。」 sounds less natural when providing
          a brief, connected overview. We're looking for a concise way to link these two facts.
    scene: You are introducing a new team member to a colleague, providing a brief background.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: This example links a noun 「大学生」 (university student) with another action 「アルバイト を して います」
      (works part-time) using 「〜で」. The semi-formal register is reflected in the use of 「〜しています」. Casual
      alternatives like 「〜している」 and 「〜してる ん だ」 are common in informal settings, with 「〜してる ん だ」 often
      used by male speakers for explanatory nuance.
  - english: The road is narrow and dangerous, so please be careful.

          - 道 が 狭い です。危ない です。だ から、注意 し て ください。
        english: The road is narrow. It is dangerous. Therefore, please be careful.
        hint: Listing separate reasons with 「からです」 or 「だから」 makes the warning less immediate and cohesive.
          We're looking for a combined reason for caution.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 道 が 狭い し、危ない し、注意 し て ください。
        english: The road is narrow, and it's dangerous, so please be careful.
        hint: While 「〜し〜し」 can list reasons, it implies a more general or exhaustive enumeration rather
          than a direct, strong causal link between the combined dangers and the need for immediate caution.
          We're looking for a direct causal connection.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 道 が 狭い から、危ない から、注意 し て ください。
        english: Because the road is narrow, and because it is dangerous, please be careful.
        hint: Repeating 「から」 for each reason can sound redundant and less natural when the reasons are
          closely related and form a single, combined cause for the action. We're looking for a more concise
          way to express combined reasons.
    scene: A driving instructor warns a student about a specific road during a lesson.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The male instructor uses the 「〜くて」 form of the い-adjectives 「狭い」 (narrow) and 「危ない」 (dangerous)
      to provide a direct reason for the instruction 「注意 して ください」 (please be careful). The use of 「〜ので」
      further clarifies the causal link. The polite 「〜です の で」 offers a slightly softer politeness, while
      the casual 「〜から、気 を つけて」 is a more direct, less formal warning, suitable for very close relationships
      or immediate situations.
  - english: Today I'm free and have time, so why don't we go shopping?
    japanese:

        english: Today I'm free. I have time. So, why don't we go shopping?
        hint: Separating the reasons into two sentences with 「それで」 makes the connection less direct and
          fluid. We're looking for a smooth expression of two combined conditions that lead to the invitation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 暇 だ し、時間 が ある し、買い物 に 行き ませ ん か。
        english: Today I'm free, and I have time, so why don't we go shopping?
        hint: While 「〜し〜し」 can list multiple reasons, it often implies a less direct or more comprehensive
          enumeration. Here, 「〜で」 connects the two conditions more seamlessly as a combined reason for
          the invitation. We're looking for a smooth expression of two combined conditions that lead to
          the invitation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 暇 だ から、時間 が ある から、買い物 に 行き ませ ん か。
        english: Because today I'm free, and because I have time, why don't we go shopping?
        hint: Repeating 「から」 for each reason can sound redundant and less natural when the reasons are
          closely related and form a single, combined cause for the invitation. We're looking for a more
          concise way to express combined reasons.
    scene: A friend invites another friend out for shopping on a day when they both have unexpected free
      time.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The female speaker uses the casual 「〜で」 to link the な-adjective 「暇」 (free) and the state of
      「時間 が ある」 (having time) as the reasons for her invitation. The casual tone and directness of the
      question 「行きません か」 are typical between close friends. More casual options include dropping 「が」 for
      「時間 ある」 and using 「〜から」 with a direct question 「行かない？」. The addition of 「〜行こう ぜ」 provides a masculine,
      emphatic invitation.
  - english: This cake is sweet and delicious.
    japanese:
      - この ケーキ は {甘く て} おいしい です。

        english: This cake is sweet. It's delicious.
        hint: Separating the adjectives into two sentences makes the description less fluid and cohesive.
          We're looking for a natural way to connect these two descriptive qualities.
    scene: You're enjoying a dessert at a cafe with a friend, commenting on its taste.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: This sentence uses 「甘い」 (sweet) linked with 「おいしい」 (delicious) via 「〜くて」 to describe the cake's
      pleasant qualities. The polite 「です」 makes it suitable for general conversation among friends. Casual
      forms like dropping 「です」, or adding female markers like 「〜わ ね」, or youth slang like 「マジ」 (really)
      and 「うまい」 (tasty/awesome) add different nuances of intimacy or enthusiasm.

        english: Yesterday wasn't very fun. So, I went to bed early.
        hint: Using two separate sentences with 「それで」 creates a slight pause and less direct cause-and-effect.
          We're looking for a continuous flow to express the reason for an action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昨日 は あまり 楽しく ない し、早く 寝 まし た。
        english: Yesterday wasn't very fun, so I went to bed early.
        hint: Similar to positive reasons, 「〜ないし」 implies listing. When the first clause is a direct,
          singular reason for the second, 「〜なくて」 provides a more cohesive connection. We're looking for
          a direct causal connection for why the speaker went to bed early.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昨日 は あまり 楽しく ない から、早く 寝 まし た。
        english: While 「〜から」 can state a reason, 「〜くて」 often creates a tighter, more integrated cause-and-effect
          flow, especially when the reason is an inherent quality or state described by an adjective.
          We're looking for a smoother connection between the state and the action.

          We're looking for a smoother connection between the state and the action.
    scene: A young female student is recounting a dull day to a classmate, expressing her lack of enjoyment.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The younger female speaker uses the casual 「〜くて」 form of the negative い-adjective 「楽しくない」
      (not fun) to explain the reason for her action 「早く 寝ました」 (went to bed early). The phrase 「あまり」 (not
      very) adds emphasis to the lack of enjoyment. The form 「あんまり」 is a more casual variant. The use
      of 「〜ちゃった」 in place of 「〜ました」 indicates a sense of having done something unintentionally or with
      slight regret, common in casual speech. The expression 「〜た ん だ」 provides an explanatory nuance.
  - english: It was cold, so I put on a thick coat.

        english: Today it's cold. So, I put on a thick coat.
        hint: Using two separate sentences like 「寒いです。それで…」 can make the connection feel less direct and
          fluid. We're looking for a continuous flow to express a reason for an action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 寒い し、厚い コート を 着 まし た。
        english: Today it's cold, and I put on a thick coat.
        hint: While 「〜し」 can list reasons, it implies a more general enumeration. When the first clause
          is a direct, singular reason for the second, 「〜くて」 provides a more cohesive connection. We're
          looking for a direct causal connection for why the speaker put on a coat.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 は 寒い から、厚い コート を 着 まし た。
        english: Because today it was cold, I put on a thick coat.
        hint: While 「〜から」 can state a reason, 「〜くて」 often creates a tighter, more integrated cause-and-effect
          flow, especially when the reason is an inherent quality or state described by an adjective.
          We're looking for a smoother connection between the state and the action.
    scene: You are explaining to a friend why you are dressed warmly.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: This example illustrates the use of 「〜くて」 to express a reason. The い-adjective 「寒い」 (cold)
      directly explains why the speaker put on a thick coat. This is a common and natural way to link
      a causative condition to a resulting action. The polite form 「着ました」 is suitable for general conversation,
      while 「着た」 offers a casual alternative.

        english: That hotel is convenient. It is clean. Therefore, it's popular.
        hint: Separating the attributes into multiple sentences makes the description less cohesive and

          to a consequence.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: Because that hotel is convenient, and because it is clean, it's popular.
        hint: Repeating 「から」 for each attribute sounds less natural when they are presented as combined
          characteristics leading to a single outcome. We're looking for a concise way to link these features.
    scene: You are recommending a hotel to a colleague.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: Here, 「〜で」 connects two positive attributes, 「便利」 (convenient) and 「綺麗」 (clean), both な-adjectives,
      which collectively serve as the reason for the hotel's popularity. The use of 「〜なので」 or 「〜だから」 reinforces
      the causal relationship, making the recommendation clear and logical. This structure is common when
      presenting multiple reasons that lead to a single outcome, especially in professional or explanatory
      contexts.

          emphasize the direct connection between them. We're looking for a concise way to link her profession
          to her expertise.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 医者 な の で、健康 に とても 詳しい です。
        english: While 「〜なので」 also indicates a reason, 「〜で」 directly links the noun (her being a doctor)
          to the resulting attribute (her knowledge), emphasizing the state itself as the basis for the
          knowledge, rather than simply stating 'because of' her profession. We're looking for a more
          direct descriptive link.
        hint: While 「〜なので」 also indicates a reason, 「〜で」 directly links the noun (her being a doctor)

          direct descriptive link.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 は 医者 だ から、健康 に とても 詳しい です。
        english: While 「〜から」 states a reason, 「〜で」 creates a more integrated description, implying that
          her being a doctor is an inherent quality that leads to her extensive health knowledge, rather
          than just a separate causal event. We're looking for a more descriptive connection between her
          profession and her expertise.

    scene: You are discussing a new colleague's expertise with a team member.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: This example demonstrates how 「〜で」 can connect a noun, in this case, a profession 「医者」 (doctor),
      to a subsequent state or characteristic, 「健康 に とても 詳しい」 (very knowledgeable about health), implying
      a direct causal link. Being a doctor inherently leads to specialized health knowledge, which is
      smoothly conveyed by this construction. This is a concise way to state a fact and its direct consequence.
      「めっちゃ」 is a casual intensifier common in informal speech.
  - english: The test was difficult, so I couldn't get a good score.
    japanese:
      - 試験 が {難しく て} いい 点 が 取れ ませ ん でし た。
      - 試験 が {難しく て} いい 点 取れ なかっ た。
    english_literally: Test, difficult, so good score could not take.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 試験 は 難しかっ た です。だ から、いい 点 が 取れ ませ ん でし た。
        english: The test was difficult. Therefore, I couldn't get a good score.
        hint: Using separate sentences creates a less fluid connection between the cause and effect. We're
          looking for a smooth expression of a single reason leading to a result.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 試験 は 難しかっ た の で、いい 点 が 取れ ませ ん でし た。
        english: While 「〜ので」 correctly states the reason, 「〜くて」 forms a more direct and often more natural-sounding
          connection when the first clause is an adjective describing the cause. We're looking for a tighter
          link between the descriptive cause and its effect.
        hint: While 「〜ので」 correctly states the reason, 「〜くて」 forms a more direct and often more natural-sounding
          connection when the first clause is an adjective describing the cause. We're looking for a tighter
          link between the descriptive cause and its effect.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 試験 は 難しかっ た から、いい 点 が 取れ ませ ん でし た。
        english: While 「〜から」 correctly states the reason, 「〜くて」 often forms a more direct and natural-sounding
          connection when the first clause is an adjective describing the cause. We're looking for a tighter
          link between the descriptive cause and its effect.
        hint: While 「〜から」 correctly states the reason, 「〜くて」 often forms a more direct and natural-sounding
          connection when the first clause is an adjective describing the cause. We're looking for a tighter
          link between the descriptive cause and its effect.
    scene: A student discusses their test results with a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: This sentence uses the past te-form of an い-adjective 「難しい」 (difficult) to state the reason
      for the negative outcome. 「難しく て」 directly explains why the speaker couldn't get a good score. This
      is a common way to express a causal relationship where the first clause is a descriptive reason
      for the second. The casual form 「取れなかった」 is common in informal conversations.
  - english: That restaurant is famous and delicious, so it's always crowded.
    japanese:
      - あの レストラン は {有名 で} 美味しい の で、いつ も 混ん で い ます。
      - あの レストラン は {有名 で} 美味しい から、いつ も 混ん でる よ。
    english_literally: That restaurant, famous and delicious, so always crowded is.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの レストラン は 便利 です。綺麗 です。だ から、人気 が あり ます。
        english: That restaurant is convenient. It is clean. Therefore, it's popular.
        hint: Separating the attributes into multiple sentences makes the description less cohesive and
          the causal link less immediate. We're looking for a smooth connection of attributes that lead
          to a consequence.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの レストラン は 有名 だ し、美味しい し、いつ も 混ん で い ます。
        english: That restaurant is famous, and it's delicious, so it's always crowded.
        hint: While 「〜し〜し」 can list multiple reasons, it often implies a less direct or more comprehensive
          enumeration. Here, 「〜で」 connects the two conditions more seamlessly as a combined reason for
          the popularity. We're looking for a smooth expression of two combined conditions that lead to
          the popularity.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの レストラン は 有名 だ から、美味しい から、いつ も 混ん で い ます。
        english: Because that restaurant is famous, and because it is delicious, it's always crowded.
        hint: Repeating 「から」 for each attribute sounds less natural when they are presented as combined
          characteristics leading to a single outcome. We're looking for a concise way to link these features.
    scene: Two colleagues are discussing popular local restaurants.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: Here, 「〜で」 connects a な-adjective 「有名」 (famous) and an い-adjective 「美味しい」 (delicious) to explain
      the reason for the restaurant's popularity. This demonstrates linking different types of adjectives
      with the te-form (via the copula for な-adjectives). The phrasing is suitable for explaining a situation
      in a polite and informative manner. The casual 「混んでる よ」 adds a personal touch for closer acquaintances.
post_example_writeup: Understanding whether 「〜くて/〜で」 indicates a simple linking or a reason largely depends
  on the logical relationship between the two clauses and the overall context. If the first clause directly
  explains or causes the second, it's a reason; otherwise, it's a list of attributes or events.
