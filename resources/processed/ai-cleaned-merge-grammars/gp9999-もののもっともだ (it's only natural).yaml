jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Often used when discussing opinions, reactions, or consequences that are regrettable
    or negative, but are nonetheless understandable.
  function: To express that something is a logical, reasonable, or understandable outcome/reaction given
    the circumstances.
  nuance: Carries a nuance of agreement, empathy, or justification, often implying that the speaker can
    fully comprehend why something is the way it is or why someone feels/acts a certain way. It acknowledges
    the naturalness of a situation or reaction.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a sentence-ending expression, often commenting on the preceding clause.
  logical-flow: Indicates a cause-and-effect relationship where the effect is perceived as a natural or
    justified consequence of the cause.
etymology: The expression 「もののもっともだ」 is derived from 「もの」 (indicating a reason or explanation, similar
  to 「のだ」 or 「んだ」) and 「もっとも」 (meaning 'reasonable,' 'justifiable,' or 'most proper'). So, it literally
  means 'it is most proper/reasonable due to the fact that...'. This grammatical construction emphasizes
  the inherent logicality or naturalness of a situation, making it an understandable or even justifiable
  outcome. The 「の」 acts as a nominalizer, turning the preceding clause into a noun phrase, which is then
  described as 「もっともだ」.
writeup: The phrase 「もののもっともだ」 is used to convey that something is **only natural**, **understandable**,
  or **reasonable** given the circumstances. It's often employed when the speaker acknowledges a situation
  or a reaction as a logical and justifiable outcome, even if it's an undesirable one. It signals that
  you can fully empathize with or comprehend *why* something is the way it is.This expression is versatile
  and can follow verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives (with な), and nouns (with の) in their plain forms.
  It's typically used in more formal or reflective contexts than casual conversation. While it shares
  meaning with similar phrases like 「〜のも当然だ」, 「もののもっともだ」 often carries a slightly stronger sense of personal
  judgment or empathy, indicating that the speaker finds the situation or emotion particularly valid and
  understandable.
false_friends:
  - term: のも当然だ
    meaning: It's only natural that...; It's a matter of course that...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「もののもっともだ」 often implies that something is **reasonable or understandable** given a
      specific context, 「のも当然だ」 can imply a more **objective or expected naturalness**, sometimes even
      inevitability, without necessarily conveying the same sense of sympathetic reasoning.
    grammar_point: のも当然だ (it is only natural)
  - term: 〜て当然だ
    meaning: It's only natural to (do X); It's obvious that (X would happen)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This form specifically indicates that a **reaction or consequence** is natural or obvious,
      often for an action or state. 「もののもっともだ」 is broader, applying to statements, situations, or feelings,
      not just actions.
    grammar_point: て当然だ (natural・obvious)
  - term: はずだ
    meaning: expected to be
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「はずだ」 expresses a **strong expectation or logical certainty** based on available information
      or common sense. 「もののもっともだ」 focuses more on the **reasonableness or understandability** of something,
      implying an empathetic acceptance rather than a logical prediction.
    grammar_point: はずだ (is expected to be)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'When choosing between these expressions, consider the nuance: if you want
  to express a more empathetic understanding of *why* something is natural or reasonable given the circumstances,
  「もののもっともだ」 is often the best choice. If you''re stating something that is objectively or widely accepted
  as natural or inevitable, 「のも当然だ」 might be more suitable. If it''s about a natural reaction to an action,
  「〜て当然だ」 is specific. Remember, 「はずだ」 is about logical expectation, not necessarily about the inherent
  reasonableness of a situation.'
