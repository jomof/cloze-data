formation:
  い-Adjective (minus い) + かったら: Used to express a conditional statement based on a past or hypothetical
    past state of an い-adjective. The result clause follows.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The formation combines the past tense form of い-adjectives (formed by dropping the final い
  and adding かった) with the conditional particle たら. The かった ending itself evolved from a combination of
  the stem form of the adjective and the past auxiliary けり. The たら conditional evolved from the past auxiliary
  た followed by the particle ら, which indicates an assumption or possibility. Thus, い-Adjective[かったら]
  literally means 'if it was (such an adjective)' or 'if it had been (such an adjective)'.
writeup: |-
  The い-Adjective[かったら] form is used to express a conditional statement about a past or hypothetical past situation involving an い-adjective. It is constructed by taking an い-adjective, dropping its final い, and adding かったら. This structure creates a clause that sets up a condition, with the subsequent clause describing the result or consequence of that condition.

  This form is highly versatile and can be used in several scenarios:

  *   **Past factual condition**: When the speaker is referring to a condition that actually occurred in the past, and a consequence followed.
  *   **Hypothetical past condition**: When the speaker is imagining a past situation that did not happen (a counterfactual condition), and discussing what would have happened if it had.
  *   **Suggestion/Request**: When politely making a suggestion or request based on a potential past or current state that is implicitly assumed as past for the sake of the conditional (e.g., if it was good, then...). While the 'past' element is present, the nuance is often about an *option* or *possibility*.

  It is important to remember that the consequence clause can be in any tense, depending on whether the result is past, present, or future relative to the condition.
false_friends:
  - term: い-Adjective[ければ] (conditional)
    meaning: if (it) is (an i-adjective)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「い-Adjective[かったら]」 specifies a past or hypothetical past condition, whereas 「い-Adjective[ければ]」
      is a general conditional for present or future states, often implying a stronger logical or habitual
      connection, or used for recommendations and negative conditions.
    grammar_point: Verb[えば] (conditional)
  - term: い-Adjective[ても] (concessive)
    meaning: even if (it) is (an i-adjective)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「い-Adjective[かったら]」 sets a condition where the consequence depends on the condition, while
      「い-Adjective[ても]」 expresses concession, meaning the consequence is true regardless of the adjectival
      state.
    grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
  - term: い-Adjective[のに] (unexpected result)
    meaning: despite (it) being (an i-adjective)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「い-Adjective[かったら]」 introduces a conditional clause, suggesting a cause-and-effect or hypothetical
      relationship. In contrast, 「い-Adjective[のに]」 expresses a sense of surprise, dissatisfaction, or
      unfulfilled expectation regarding a state that already exists or existed.
    grammar_point: のに (unexpected result)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'When distinguishing between these forms, focus on the speaker''s intent:
  Is it a direct ''if...then'' statement about a past state (かったら)? Is it a general ''if...then'' for
  present/future (ければ)? Is it ''even if...'' regardless of the condition (ても)? Or is it ''despite...''
  expressing an unexpected outcome (のに)? Paying attention to the context and desired nuance will help
  clarify which form to use.'

post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how い-Adjective[かったら] can be used to describe various past
  or hypothetical past scenarios. It consistently forms a conditional clause that sets up a specific adjectival
  state, leading to a consequent action or outcome. The nuance often implies a direct relationship, whether
  factual or counterfactual. Pay close attention to the context to determine if a past, current, or hypothetical
  result is intended after the past adjectival condition.
