grammar_point: に値する (to be worth, to deserve)
learn_before:
  - ぜ (male emphatic particle)
  - そこで (and so・at that point・therefore)
  - ～に値しない (not worth)
id: gp9999
meaning: to be worthy of; to deserve; to merit
pronunciation:
  katakana: ニアタイスル
  romaji: ni atai suru
formation:
  Noun + に値する: Indicates that a noun has enough value or merit to warrant something.
  Verb[dictionary] + に値する: Indicates that the action of a verb has enough value or merit to warrant something.
jlpt: N1
etymology: The expression combines the particle 「に」 (ni), indicating a target or object, with 「値する」 (atai
  suru). 「値」 (atai) means 'value' or 'worth', and 「する」 (suru) means 'to do' or 'to be'. Therefore, 「に値する」
  literally conveys 'to be equivalent to in value' or 'to be worthy of value towards' something. This
  construction highlights that the preceding element possesses inherent merit that warrants the subsequent
  action or recognition.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「に値する」 is used to convey that a noun or an action is **worthy of**, **deserves**, or **merits** something. It strongly emphasizes the **inherent value** or **suitability** of the subject to receive a particular outcome, recognition, or treatment.

  This expression is typically found in **formal or literary contexts**, such as official reports, academic papers, news articles, or public speeches. It is less common in casual everyday conversation.

  While it often implies a positive judgment (e.g., deserving of praise), it can also be used in neutral or even negative contexts, where the subject warrants a certain negative outcome (e.g., deserving of punishment). The core meaning remains that the subject's qualities justify the given outcome or status.

  - term: に足る
    meaning: to be sufficient for; to be worthy of (in a general sense of capability)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「に足る」 also means 'to be worthy of', it often emphasizes sufficiency or capability for
      a task or purpose. For example, 「信頼に足る人」 means 'a person capable of being trusted' or 'a person
      sufficient for trust'. 「に値する」, on the other hand, more strongly implies inherent value and deservingness.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:に足る (to be sufficient for・to be worthy of)
  - term: にふさわしい
    meaning: suitable for; appropriate for; becoming of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「にふさわしい」 focuses on appropriateness, fittingness, or being becoming of something. It asks
      whether something is 'proper' for a situation or role. 「に値する」 emphasizes inherent worth or merit,
      suggesting that something has the actual value to deserve the outcome.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:にふさわしい (suitable for)
  - term: 価値がある
    meaning: to have value; to be valuable; to be worth
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「価値がある」 is a more general statement that something simply 'has value' or 'is valuable'. 「に値する」
      goes a step further, indicating that this value is significant enough to 'deserve' or 'merit' a
      particular action, recognition, or outcome.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:価値がある (to have value)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'When differentiating between 「に値する」, 「に足る」, and 「にふさわしい」, consider the underlying
  emphasis: 「に値する」 is about inherent *worth* or *deservingness*. 「に足る」 is about *sufficiency* or *capability*.
  「にふさわしい」 is about *appropriateness* or *fittingness*. While there can be overlap in translation, their
  core nuances guide their appropriate usage. 「価値がある」 is a broader term for ''having value'', without
  the strong implication of ''deserving'' a specific outcome that 「に値する」 carries.'
