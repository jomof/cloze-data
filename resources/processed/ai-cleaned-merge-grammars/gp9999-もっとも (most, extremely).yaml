jlpt: N1
etymology: The word もっとも is believed to derive from 真 (まこと - truth, reality) or 最 (もっと - most) coupled
  with 端 (も - edge, end). Originally, it meant 'the utmost truth' or 'the ultimate reality,' signifying
  something that is indeed true or most fitting. Over time, its meaning expanded to encompass 'most,'
  'extremely,' or 'indeed,' emphasizing the highest degree or the indisputable truth of a statement. This
  dual origin helps explain its use both as a superlative and as a term that asserts the correctness or
  logical outcome of something.
writeup: |-
  The adverb もっとも is employed to express the highest degree of a quality, state, or manner, or to assert the truth or logicality of a statement. It translates broadly to 'most,' 'extremely,' 'indeed,' or 'truly.'

  Compared to `一番` (ichiban), which is the most common and versatile superlative, もっとも carries a more formal, literary, or intellectual nuance. While `一番` is frequently used for objective rankings (e.g., 'the tallest building,' 'the fastest car'), もっとも is often reserved for situations where a definitive statement is being made, or when emphasizing a subjective yet profound truth or quality. It often precedes adjectives (both い-adjectives and な-adjectives) and adverbs.

  When used with a verb or as the fixed expression `もっともだ`, it functions to affirm the truth, reasonableness, or justness of a statement, conveying a sense of 'that is indeed true' or 'that is perfectly understandable.' This usage reflects its etymological roots related to 'truth' and 'reality.'

  Due to its formal nature, もっとも is more commonly encountered in written Japanese, academic discussions, news reports, or speeches rather than casual conversation.

  - term: もっとも (qualification・however)
    meaning: however; although; naturally; indeed
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: This もっとも functions as a conjunctive adverb, introducing a qualification or a counter-statement,
      similar to しかし. It typically stands at the beginning of a clause. The もっとも meaning 'most/extremely'
      is an adverb modifying an adjective, adverb, or verb to denote the highest degree or truth, and
      usually precedes the word it modifies.
    grammar_point: もっとも (qualification・however)
  - term: 一番 (superlative)
    meaning: most; best; number one
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`一番` is the general and most common way to form superlatives, applicable in a wide range
      of situations for objective rankings. `もっとも` is more formal and literary, often used for abstract
      qualities or in definitive statements, carrying a nuance of ''indeed'' or ''truly the most,'' and
      may imply a subjective or reasoned conclusion.'
    grammar_point: 一番 (superlative)
  - term: とても (very)
    meaning: very; awfully; exceedingly
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '`とても` is a common intensifier for adjectives and adverbs, indicating a high degree. `もっとも`
      expresses the *highest* degree, making it a superlative, whereas `とても` simply indicates a significant
      but not necessarily maximal degree.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:とても (very)
post_false_friends_writeup: Distinguishing between the two meanings of `もっとも` and similar intensifiers
  is crucial. The 'most/extremely' `もっとも` typically precedes an adjective, adverb, or verb, intensifying
  its meaning or asserting its truth. The 'however' `もっとも` acts as a conjunctive adverb, usually appearing
  at the start of a clause to introduce a condition or an exception. Pay close attention to the grammatical
  role and position of `もっとも` in the sentence. While `一番` and `とても` also express high degrees, `もっとも`
  often conveys a sense of formal or reasoned judgment.
