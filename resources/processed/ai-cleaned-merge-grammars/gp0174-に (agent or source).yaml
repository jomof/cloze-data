details:
  part-of-speech: particle
  particle-syntactic-function: passive-agent
  function: Indicates the agent or source of an action in passive, causative, and receiving constructions.
  colocation: Used with passive verbs, causative verbs, and verbs of receiving or acquisition (e.g., もらう,
    習う, 教わる, 借りる, 聞く).
  grammatical-role: Marks the agent or source.
  logical-flow: Establishes a cause-and-effect or source-recipient relationship.
  temporal-flow: Implies the agent or source existed or acted prior to the main verb's action.
  spatial-flow: Can imply movement from a source (e.g., receiving from someone). This is more pronounced
    in other uses of に, but still present in its sense of source here.
etymology: The particle 「に」 originally indicated location or direction. Over time, it expanded to mark
  other relationships, including the agent or source in passive, causative, and receiving constructions.
  This usage highlights 「に」's function of indicating a connection or relationship between elements in
  a sentence.
writeup: The particle 「に」 indicates the agent performing an action in passive sentences, the person being
  made to do something in causative sentences, or the source from which something is received. It's commonly
  used with passive verbs to specify who performed the action, with causative verbs to show who is being
  made to do something, and with verbs of receiving like 「もらう」 to specify the giver. Verbs such as 習う
  (narau - to learn), 教わる (osawaru - to be taught), and 借りる (kariru - to borrow) also often use 「に」 to
  indicate the source from which the action is received.
false_friends:
  - term: から (from)
    meaning: from
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「に」 indicates the agent in passive/causative sentences or the source with verbs like
      もらう, 習う, and 借りる, 「から」 typically indicates the starting point of an action, a source of information,
      or the material something is made from. For example, 「先生から聞きました」 (I heard it from the teacher) uses
      「から」 because it emphasizes the origin rather than the personal agent.
    grammar_point: から (from)
  - term: によって (ni yotte)
    meaning: by; due to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「によって」 is often interchangeable with 「に」 for marking the agent in passive sentences, but it
      carries a more formal or written nuance and can also emphasize the means or cause (e.g., 'by means
      of', 'due to'). 「に」 is generally more common and versatile for simple agent marking in spoken contexts.
    grammar_point: によって・による・により (means・cause・dependency)
  - term: が (ga)
    meaning: subject marker
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「が」 marks the grammatical subject of a sentence, indicating who or what is performing the
      action in an active voice. In passive sentences, 「に」 marks the agent (the one performing the action),
      while 「が」 (or 「は」) marks the subject (the one receiving the action). For example, 「犬に噛まれた」 (was
      bitten by the dog) vs. 「犬が噛んだ」 (the dog bit).
    grammar_point: が (subject marker)
  - term: で (de)
    meaning: at; in; by means of; with
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「で」 indicates the location where an action takes place, the instrument used, or the means
      by which something is done. It does not mark the agent of a passive or causative action. For example,
      「電車で来る」 (come by train) vs. 「母に褒められた」 (was praised by mother).
    grammar_point: で (by)
  - term: を (object marker)
    meaning: direct object marker
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: When using causative verbs, 「を」 marks the person who is made to do something if the verb itself
      is intransitive (e.g., 歩く を 歩かせる), emphasizing the forced movement. In contrast, 「に」 marks the person
      who is made to do something if the verb is transitive and already takes a direct object (e.g., 本
      を 読む -> 学生 に 本 を 読ませる). 「に」 here identifies the person as the indirect agent of the coerced action.
    grammar_point: を (object marker)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「に」 and 「から」 both can express 'from,' but their usage differs. Use 「に」 when
  indicating who performed an action passively, who is being made to do something, or the source of receiving.
  Use 「から」 for the starting point of an action, the source of information, or the material something is
  made of. Furthermore, 「によって」 often overlaps with 「に」 in passive constructions but is more formal and
  can imply 'by means of,' while 「が」 marks the subject of an active sentence, contrasting with 「に」 marking
  the agent in a passive sentence. 「で」 specifies means or location, not the agent or source. Finally,
  when using causative verbs, carefully distinguish between 「を」 for intransitive verbs (e.g., 学生 を 走らせる)
  and 「に」 for transitive verbs (e.g., 学生 に 宿題 を させる).

    scene: Two people are discussing an artwork in a museum.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, 「に」 is highly versatile in marking the agent or source
  in passive, causative, and receiving constructions. Pay close attention to the verb used in conjunction
  with 「に」, as this will often clarify its specific role in the sentence. Understanding these distinct
  patterns will help you accurately express who performed an action, who was made to do something, or
  from whom something was received, adding precision and nuance to your Japanese.
