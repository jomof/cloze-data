        "Register": "Varies depending on usage. Can be formal or informal.",
        "Function": "Used to inquire about price, quantity, or degree. Can also express 'no matter how' when used with ても.",

    },
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「いくら」 is somewhat debated, but it is commonly believed to be derived from the verb 「如何」 (いかが), meaning \"how\" or \"in what way.\" Over time, 「いかが」 evolved to focus on the quantitative aspect, leading to the modern meaning of 「いくら」.",
    "writeup": "「いくら」 is a versatile word with several key functions. Primarily, it is used to ask \"how much\" something costs or \"how\" something is done. It can also express the idea of \"no matter how\" when used with the 「～ても」 form. \n\nWhen used alone, 「いくら」 directly questions the amount or price. For example, 「この本はいくらですか」 (How much is this book?).\n\n「いくら + verb-ても/adjective-くて/noun-でも」 indicates that something remains true regardless of the quantity or degree. For example, 「いくら食べても太らない」 (No matter how much I eat, I don't gain weight). This usage highlights the lack of impact despite the amount.\n\n「いくらでも」 means \"any amount is fine\" or \"as much as one likes.\" For instance, 「飲み物はいくらでもどうぞ」 (Please have as much of the drinks as you like). This form is often used to offer abundance or express generosity.\n\n「いくらも」 with a negative verb (～ない) means \"not much.\" For example, 「いくらも残っていない」 (There isn't much left).",
