        "function": "Used to inquire about quantity or price; expresses 'no matter how' (with ～ても); indicates 'any amount is fine' or 'as much as one likes' (with ～でも); signifies 'not much' or 'barely any' (with ～も and negative verb).",
        "nuance": "As an interrogative, it directly asks about the extent, degree, or cost. When combined with ～ても, it highlights a persistent situation regardless of the effort or degree. With ～でも, it conveys generosity or unlimited availability. With ～も and a negative verb, it emphasizes a scarcity or very limited quantity."
    },
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「いくら」 is somewhat debated, but it is commonly believed to be derived from the verb 「如何」 (いかが), meaning \"how\" or \"in what way.\" Over time, 「いかが」 evolved to focus on the quantitative aspect, leading to the modern meaning of 「いくら」.",
    "writeup": "「いくら」 is a versatile Japanese word with multiple functions, primarily serving as an interrogative adverb meaning \"how much\" or \"how.\" Its precise nuance changes depending on the particle it is paired with. Understanding these different usages is crucial for mastering its application.\n\n**1. As an Interrogative Adverb (いくら):**\nIn its most straightforward use, 「いくら」 asks about the quantity, amount, or price of something. It can stand alone or precede a noun or verb to specify what quantity is being inquired about.\n\n**2. Expressing 'No Matter How Much/How' (いくら～ても / ～くて / ～でも):**\nWhen combined with the 「～ても」 (te-form + も) particle, 「いくら」 conveys the meaning of \"no matter how much\" or \"no matter how.\" This construction indicates that despite the extent or degree of the action or state described, the outcome remains unchanged or a certain result persists. It often highlights a sense of futility or an unyielding situation.\n\n**3. Indicating 'Any Amount is Fine' or 'As Much as One Likes' (いくらでも):**\nAdding 「でも」 to 「いくら」 transforms its meaning to \"any amount is fine,\" \"as much as one likes,\" or \"without limit.\" This form is commonly used to express generosity, unlimited availability, or a complete lack of restriction regarding quantity or degree.\n\n**4. Expressing 'Not Much' or 'Barely Any' (いくらも～ない):**\nWhen followed by the particle 「も」 and a negative verb, 「いくらも」 signifies \"not much\" or \"barely any.\" This usage emphasizes a very small quantity or a scarcity of something. It is always used in conjunction with a negative expression.",
