    "etymology": "The expression 「にとって」 comes from the verb 「取る」 (toru, \"to take\"). Literally, it means \"taking up\" a certain standpoint. The 「に」 marks the location or standpoint being highlighted.",
    "writeup": "「にとって」 indicates a viewpoint, judgment, or opinion from a particular perspective. It's similar to 「から見て」 (from the perspective of), but 「にとって」 is often used with people's names or pronouns, as well as regular nouns. Think of it as \"to (someone),\" \"for (someone),\" or \"concerning (something), from someone's perspective.\" This emphasizes whose viewpoint is being expressed.",
