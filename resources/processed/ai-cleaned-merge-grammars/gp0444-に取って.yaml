    "etymology": "The expression にとって comes from the verb 取る (toru, \"to take\"). In this way, it literally means \"taking up\" a certain standpoint. The particle に marks the location or standpoint being highlighted.",
    "writeup": "に取って, often written as にとって, is a grammatical structure used to express opinions, judgments, or to discuss something from a particular perspective. It is frequently translated as \"to (A),\" \"for (A),\" or \"concerning (A).\" This expression shares a similar function with から見て (from the perspective of), emphasizing whose viewpoint is being expressed.\n\nTo use にとって, simply attach it to the end of a noun or noun phrase that represents the viewpoint, judgment, or opinion's source. It can be used with names, pronouns, or general nouns.\n\nBroadly, にとって has two main applications:\n\n*   **Expressing a personal or specific viewpoint:** When referring to individuals, it conveys what something means or appears to them personally, similar to 「の身として」 (from A's standpoint).\n*   **Stating a general or collective perspective:** When referring to groups, categories, or abstract concepts, it indicates how something is viewed or considered from that collective standpoint, akin to 「の立場から見て」 (when looking at it from A's position).",
