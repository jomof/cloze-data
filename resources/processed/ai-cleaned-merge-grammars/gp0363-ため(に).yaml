    "etymology": "The word 「為 (ため)」 is a noun with the core meaning of 'sake' or 'benefit'. Its usage as a grammatical particle evolved from this noun. The particle 「に」 is often appended to explicitly mark the preceding clause as a goal or reason. Historically, 「ため」 has encompassed both proactive 'purpose' and reactive 'cause', with the context determining the precise meaning.",
    "writeup": "The grammatical structure 「ため(に)」 is derived from the noun 「為 (ため)」, meaning 'sake' or 'benefit'. It serves to connect a preceding clause or word to a subsequent clause, indicating either the **purpose** for which an action is performed or the **reason/cause** for a particular state or event.\n\n### Expressing Purpose (〜する ため に)\nWhen 「ため(に)」 follows a verb in its dictionary (plain non-past) form, it signifies the **purpose** or **goal** of the action described in the main clause. In this context, it translates to \"in order to do X\" or \"for the purpose of X\". The action in the main clause is always a deliberate and volitional one.\n\n*   **Formation:** Verb (dictionary form) + ため(に)\n\n### Expressing Reason or Cause (〜ので、〜から)\n「ため(に)」 can also convey a **reason** or **cause**, translating to \"because of X\" or \"due to X\". This usage is broad and can follow various word types:\n\n*   **Verb:** When following a verb in any plain form (non-past or past), it expresses reason. If the verb is in the past tense, it *exclusively* denotes reason/cause, not purpose. For instance, 「食べた ため に」 means \"because I ate\", not \"in order to eat\".\n    *   **Formation:** Verb (plain form, any tense) + ため(に)\n*   **Adjectives:** For い-adjectives, it follows the plain form. For な-adjectives, it follows the stem plus 「な」 or 「だった」 (for past tense). This primarily indicates reason.\n    *   **Formation:** い-adjective (plain form, any tense) + ため(に)\n    *   **Formation:** な-adjective (stem + な / stem + だった) + ため(に)\n*   **Nouns:** When following a noun, it's typically combined with 「の」 for non-past reasons/purposes, or 「だった」 for past reasons. 「Noun の ため に」 can mean \"for the sake of Noun\" (purpose) or \"because of Noun\" (reason). 「Noun だった ため に」 means \"because it was Noun\" (reason).\n    *   **Formation:** Noun + の + ため(に)\n    *   **Formation:** Noun + だった + ため(に)\n\n**Important Note:** The particle 「に」 in 「ため(に)」 is optional, especially in casual speech or when indicating a reason, but its inclusion often strengthens the sense of purpose or a direct cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nAlthough 「ため(に)」 covers both purpose and reason, its use for expressing purpose often implies a more conscious and deliberate effort toward a goal, while its use for reason can simply state a factual cause or consequence.",
