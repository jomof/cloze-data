    "etymology": "「がたい」 comes from the kanji 難 (むずか)しい, meaning \"difficult.\" It shares the same root, but functions as a suffix attached to verb stems, intensifying the sense of difficulty or impossibility.",
    "writeup": "「がたい」, written in hiragana, is a suffix that attaches to the ます-stem of verbs to express that something is **difficult or impossible** to do. While it shares the kanji root 難 (difficult) with 「難しい」, it's crucial to understand its usage as a suffix. Unlike 「にくい」, which indicates something is difficult based on personal feeling or experience, 「がたい」 emphasizes inherent difficulty or infeasibility of the task itself, implying a stronger sense of impossibility.",
