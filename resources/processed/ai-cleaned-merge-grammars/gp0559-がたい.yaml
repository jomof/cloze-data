    "etymology": "The suffix 「がたい」 comes from the classical Japanese adjective 「難し(かたし)」, meaning \"difficult.\" Over time, it evolved into its current form and function as a suffix attached to verb stems.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「がたい」, derived from the same kanji as 「難しい」\"difficult\", also conveys the meaning of \"difficult.\" Specifically, 「がたい」 attaches to the stem (masu-stem) of verbs, indicating that something is difficult to do.\n\nIt's almost always written in hiragana. Compared to 「にくい」, which suggests something is merely \"uncomfortable\" to do, 「がたい」 implies a higher degree of difficulty, distress, or infeasibility, often suggesting near impossibility.\n\nIn essence:\n\n*   「にくい」: Something is difficult based on personal opinion, experience, or general feeling.\n*   「がたい」: Something is inherently difficult due to the nature of the task itself.",
