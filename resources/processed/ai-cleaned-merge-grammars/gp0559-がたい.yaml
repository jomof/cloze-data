    "etymology": "「がたい」 comes from the kanji 難 (むずかしい), meaning \"difficult.\" It shares the same root, but functions as a suffix attached to verb stems, intensifying the sense of difficulty or impossibility.",
    "writeup": "「がたい」 is a suffix that attaches to the masu-stem of verbs (verb stem + がたい) to express that something is **difficult or almost impossible** to do. Although it shares the kanji root 難 (difficult) with 「難しい」, its function as a suffix differentiates its usage. Unlike 「にくい」, which indicates difficulty based on subjective feelings, personal experience, or physical discomfort (e.g., 'it's difficult to do' or 'it's unpleasant to do'), 「がたい」 emphasizes the **inherent, objective difficulty or infeasibility** of the action itself. It conveys a stronger sense of impossibility, implying that the task or action possesses a high degree of difficulty or distress. Consequently, 「がたい」 is often used in more formal or serious contexts.",
