    "etymology": "This grammar point is a shortened version of 「ないといけない」. 「ない」 is the negative form of 「ある」 (to exist/be). 「と」 has a conditional meaning, and 「いけない」 means 'cannot go' or 'is not good'. So the literal meaning is close to 'if it is not, it is not good'.",
    "writeup": "「ないと」 is a contraction of 「ないといけない」, expressing the idea that something **must** be done or that one **has to** do something. It carries a sense of obligation or necessity. It is considered a casual expression. The 「いけない」 part can be replaced with 「だめ」 for an even more casual feel. Be careful because, while 「ならない」 may appear similar, it is generally not used in place of 「いけない」 or 「だめ」.",
