    "details": {
        "Register": "Varies depending on the verb and context.",
        "Function": "To mark the reason or object of an emotion, rather than a direct object.",
        "Verbs Used": "Typically used with verbs expressing emotion such as 悲しむ (kanashimu - to grieve), 喜ぶ (yorokobu - to be happy), 恐れる (osoreru - to fear), 懐かしむ (natsukashimu - to miss), 悩む (nayamu - to worry)."
    },
    "writeup": "This usage of the particle 「を」 marks the **object or cause of an emotion**, differing from its more common function as a direct object marker. It's typically used with verbs that express internal feelings or psychological states. These verbs include 「悲しむ」(to grieve), 「喜ぶ」(to be happy), 「恐れる」(to fear), 「懐かしむ」(to miss nostalgically), and 「悩む」(to worry). The nuance is that the noun preceding 「を」 is what *triggers* the emotion. This usage is distinct from transitive verbs where 「を」 indicates a direct action upon an object.",
    "etymology": "The particle 「を」 originally served a broader function than simply marking direct objects. Its use to indicate the object of an emotion is a remnant of this broader usage, highlighting the *target* or *stimulus* of the feeling.",
