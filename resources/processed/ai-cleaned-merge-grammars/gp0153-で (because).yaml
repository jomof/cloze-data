        "[Noun (reason/cause)] + で": "Indicates the reason or cause for an event or state. This is typically used for objective, factual reasons.",

        "part-of-speech": "particle",
        "particle-syntactic-function": "causal",
        "function": "Indicates the reason, cause, or means by which something occurs.",
        "nuance": "Implies a more direct or objective causal relationship than から or ので. It cannot be used to express a request or suggestion.",
        "source": "Can be thought of as originating from the te-form of です, indicating a state or condition that leads to a result."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle で used to indicate reason or cause is believed to have originated from the て form of the copula です. This evolution suggests a progression from describing a state or condition to indicating that the state is the cause of a subsequent event or situation.",
    "writeup": "The particle で serves to indicate a reason, cause, or the means by which something happens. It functions as a direct and objective connector, often translatable as \"because of,\" \"due to,\" or \"by means of.\" This contrasts with other causal particles like から or ので, which tend to introduce more subjective or softer explanations.\n\nで is typically used when the cause is a concrete noun or noun phrase, leading to a factual consequence. For instance, explaining why an event was cancelled, or how an object was created. It strictly connects objective facts. For example, 雨で (due to rain) implies the rain is a direct, observable cause.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   で cannot be used to express requests or suggestions. Its role is solely to state a cause or method. For expressions of intent or softened reasons that might lead to a request, から or ので are more appropriate.\n*   It connects a noun or noun phrase directly to the resulting action or state.\n*   The nuance of で is straightforward and factual, making it suitable for clear, concise statements.\n*   This grammar point is versatile and does not carry gender or age-specific connotations, making it appropriate for all speakers in various contexts.",
