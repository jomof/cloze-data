    "etymology": "The particle 「か」 originally functioned as a question marker. Its use as \"or\" extends from this, presenting options as alternatives within a question, which then evolved into simply offering alternatives.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「か」, often translated as \"or\" in English, fundamentally serves to present alternatives or choices. While it shares its core function with the question marker 「か」, its use in this context is to suggest options rather than to pose a direct question. It can connect nouns, phrases, or even clauses, indicating a selection between two or more possibilities. For example, in 「紅茶**か**コーヒー」, it conveys a choice between tea and coffee. When connecting nouns, the final 「か」 may sometimes be omitted for natural flow. It is important to note that using polite forms like 「です」 or 「ます」 directly after each option can shift the nuance from simply presenting choices to forming a more formal interrogative, thus it is generally advised to avoid this in contexts where you intend to simply offer alternatives rather than ask a direct question.",

Refined 'nuance' fields to explicitly reference Japanese quoted words and explain interplay (Rule 6). Removed non-etymological content from 'etymology' fields (Rule 6).",
