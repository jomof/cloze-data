    "etymology": "The particle 「か」 originally functioned as a question marker. Its use as \"or\" extends from this, presenting options as alternatives within a question, which then evolved into simply offering alternatives.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「か」 is commonly translated as \"or\" in English. However, it fundamentally functions as a question marker, presenting options. It indicates alternatives or choices. For example, 「紅茶**か**コーヒー」 means \"tea or coffee?\" in the sense of choosing between the two. \n\nIt's important to note that using 「です」 or 「ます」 after each option changes the nuance to a more formal question. Therefore, in casual contexts, it is better to avoid the polite forms. Basically, you're presenting possibilities, not necessarily asking a direct question.",
