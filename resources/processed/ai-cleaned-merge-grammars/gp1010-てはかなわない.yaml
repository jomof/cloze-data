        "usage-context": "Used to express strong dissatisfaction or a feeling of being unable to tolerate a situation. Often implies a resignation to an unavoidable, undesirable circumstance.",
        "function": "Expresses that a situation, event, or condition is highly undesirable or unbearable for the speaker.",
        "nuance": "Conveys a sense of exasperation, annoyance, or distress due to circumstances that are difficult to endure or overcome. It's stronger than simply 'disliking' something (～のは嫌だ) or finding it 'problematic' (～と困る), suggesting a level of physical or emotional toll.",
        "source": "JLPT N1 grammar; common in both spoken and written Japanese.",
        "colocation": "Often follows unpleasant or difficult conditions, actions (especially passive ones), or states.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a sentence-final expression or a clause-ending particle marking an unbearable condition."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「てはかなわない」 combines the conjunctive particle 「て」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and the negative form of the verb 「叶う」 (kanau). The original meaning of 「叶う」 is \"to be realized, to come true, to be granted (a wish)\". Therefore, 「かなわない」 literally means \"it does not come true\" or \"it cannot be realized.\" When paired with 「ては」, which introduces a condition, the overall expression conveys that \"if this condition occurs, it cannot be realized/tolerated\" or \"it is unbearable.\" This evolution highlights how a verb related to 'realization' came to express 'unbearability' in a conditional context.",
    "writeup": "The grammar structure 「てはかなわない」 is used to convey that something is undesirable or unbearable. It combines the conjunctive particle 「て」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and the negative form of the う-verb 「叶う」 (kanau). While a literal interpretation might be \"it's not a dream come true for (A),\" the actual nuance implies that a situation is so intolerable it cannot be endured.\n\nWhen used with verbs, the verb is often in the passive form, indicating that the speaker does not like being the target or victim of the action. However, standard verb structures may also be used to describe undesirable ongoing situations or actions. This pattern emphasizes the speaker's personal experience of the negative circumstance.\n\n「てはかなわない」 can also follow the conjunctive form of い-adjectives (e.g., 暑くてはかなわない, samukute wa kanawanai - \"It's unbearable when it's hot\") or appear as 「ではかなわない」 when following な-adjectives (e.g., 曖昧ではかなわない, aimai de wa kanawanai - \"It's unbearable when it's vague\").\n\nThis expression is generally gender-neutral and widely used across different age groups in standard Japanese. It conveys a strong personal feeling of exasperation.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\nWhile many grammar structures frequently appear in hiragana, making their original kanji hard to identify, it's important not to confuse 「叶う」 (to grant/realize) with 「敵う」 (to be a match for). Grammatically and semantically, these verbs are used quite differently, despite their similar sound.",

            "meaning": "cannot help but feel; cannot help but do",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「てはかなわない」, which expresses something is unbearable due to an external situation, 「てならない」 indicates an uncontrollable, often strong, internal feeling or emotion (e.g., 嬉しくてならない - 'I can't help but feel happy'). It doesn't typically convey unbearableness in the same way, focusing more on internal states rather than external conditions."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While 「てたまらない」 also expresses an intense feeling that is difficult to control or bear, it often focuses on a strong, overwhelming sensation or desire (e.g., 眠くてたまらない - 'I'm unbearably sleepy,' 食べたくてたまらない - 'I can't wait to eat'). 「てはかなわない」, however, usually emphasizes the difficulty in enduring an external situation, condition, or action that causes distress, rather than an internal sensation or desire."

            "nuance": "「にかなう」 means 'to suit,' 'to conform to,' or 'to satisfy,' implying a positive fit or fulfillment (e.g., 期待にかなう - 'to meet expectations'). This is the direct opposite of 「てはかなわない」, which expresses an inability to endure or that something does not fit/is not satisfactory, thus highlighting their contrasting meanings derived from the root verb 「叶う」."

    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that 「てはかなわない」 expresses a sense of being unable to tolerate or bear something due to its negative impact, often from an external circumstance. In contrast, 「てならない」 indicates an uncontrollable internal emotion, while 「てたまらない」 signifies an intense, overwhelming internal sensation or desire. Lastly, 「にかなう」 means something suits or satisfies a need, which is the complete opposite of the sentiment expressed by 「てはかなわない」. Pay attention to the specific type of 'unbearability' or 'intensity' being conveyed to choose the correct expression.",
