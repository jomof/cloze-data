        "usage-context": "Used to express strong dissatisfaction or a feeling of being unable to tolerate a situation. Often implies a resignation to an unavoidable, undesirable circumstance.",
        "function": "Expresses that a situation, event, or condition is highly undesirable or unbearable for the speaker.",
        "nuance": "Conveys a sense of exasperation, annoyance, or distress due to circumstances that are difficult to endure or overcome. It's stronger than simply 'disliking' something (～のは嫌だ) or finding it 'problematic' (～と困る), suggesting a level of physical or emotional toll.",
        "source": "JLPT N1 grammar; common in both spoken and written Japanese.",
        "colocation": "Often follows unpleasant or difficult conditions, actions (especially passive ones), or states.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a sentence-final expression or a clause-ending particle marking an unbearable condition."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase 「てはかなわない」 combines the conjunctive particle 「て」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and the negative form of the verb 「叶う」 (*kanau*). The original meaning of 「叶う」 is \"to be realized, to come true, to be granted (a wish)\". Therefore, 「かなわない」 literally means \"it does not come true\" or \"it cannot be realized.\" When paired with 「ては」, which introduces a condition, the overall expression conveys that \"if this condition occurs, it cannot be realized/tolerated\" or \"it is unbearable.\" This evolution highlights how a verb related to 'realization' came to express 'unbearability' in a conditional context.",
    "writeup": "The grammar structure 「てはかなわない」 is used to convey that something is undesirable or unbearable. It combines the conjunctive particle 「て」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and the negative form of the う-verb 「叶う」 (*kanau*), meaning \"to grant (a wish)\" or \"to realize (a goal).\" While a literal interpretation might be \"it's not a dream come true for (A),\" the actual nuance implies that a situation is so intolerable it cannot be endured.\n\nWhen used with verbs, the verb is often in the passive form, indicating that the speaker does not like being the target or victim of the action. However, standard verb structures may also be used to describe undesirable ongoing situations or actions. This pattern emphasizes the speaker's personal experience of the negative circumstance.\n\n「てはかなわない」 can also follow the conjunctive form of い-adjectives (e.g., 暑くてはかなわない, samukute wa kanawanai - \"It's unbearable when it's hot/cold\") or appear as 「ではかなわない」 when following な-adjectives (e.g., 曖昧ではかなわない, aimai de wa kanawanai - \"It's unbearable when it's vague\").\n\n**Important Consideration:**\nWhile many grammar structures frequently appear in hiragana, making their original kanji hard to identify, it's important not to confuse 「叶う」 (to grant/realize) with 「敵う」 (to be a match for). Grammatically and semantically, these verbs are used quite differently, despite their similar sound.",
