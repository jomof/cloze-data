    "etymology": "The grammar point 「てはかなわない」 combines 「て」 (a conjunctive particle), 「は」 (an adverbial particle), and 「かなわない」 (the negative form of the verb 「叶う」, *kanau*, meaning \"to grant a wish\" or \"to realize a goal\"). Literally, it means something like \"(something) not coming true is not good\", but the actual usage implies that something is unbearable or undesirable.",
    "writeup": "The grammar structure 「てはかなわない」 is used to convey that something is undesirable or unbearable. It combines the conjunctive particle 「て」, the adverbial particle 「は」, and the negative form of the う-verb 「叶う」 (*kanau*), which means \"to grant (a wish)\" or \"to realize (a goal).\" A more literal translation might be \"it's not a dream come true for (A).\"\n\nWhen used with verbs, the verb is often in the passive form, indicating that the speaker does not like being the target or victim of the action. However, standard verb structures may also be used.\n\n「てはかなわない」 can also follow the conjunctive form of い-adjectives or appear as 「ではかなわない」 when following な-adjectives.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\nWhile many grammar structures frequently appear in hiragana, making their original kanji hard to identify, it's important not to mix up 「叶う」 (to grant) with 「敵う」 (to be a match for). Grammatically, these verbs are used differently.",
