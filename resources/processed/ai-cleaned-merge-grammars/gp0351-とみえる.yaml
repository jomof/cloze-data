        "[Sentence] + とみえる": "Indicates that something can be deduced based on the preceding sentence.",

    "etymology": "「とみえる」combines the particle 「と」, indicating a conclusion or result, with the verb 「見える (mieru)」, meaning \"to appear\" or \"to be visible.\" Thus, the phrase literally means \"it appears that,\" implying a deduction based on observed evidence.",
    "writeup": "「とみえる」 is a phrase used to express deduction or conjecture based on available information. It combines the particle 「と」, which marks a conclusion, with the verb 「見える」, meaning \"to appear.\" Therefore, 「とみえる」 conveys the meaning of \"it seems that\" or \"one can deduce that.\" It's important to note that while it expresses a guess, it usually implies that the speaker has some basis for their conclusion, whether it's research or observation. When used with nouns or な-adjectives, 「だ」 must be inserted before 「とみえる」.\n\n*   This expression indicates a reasonable degree of confidence in the conclusion.\n*   The phrase is primarily written in hiragana, although you may occasionally see it in kanji as 「と見える」.",
