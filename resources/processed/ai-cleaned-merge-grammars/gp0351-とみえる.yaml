    "etymology": "「とみえる」 combines the particle 「と」, indicating a conclusion or result, with the verb 「見える(みえる)」, meaning \"to appear\" or \"to be visible\". Essentially, it conveys the idea that something appears to be a certain way, leading to a particular conclusion.",
    "writeup": "「とみえる」 (typically written in hiragana) is a grammatical construction combining the particle と, which marks a conclusion or quotation, with the verb 見える (みえる), meaning 'to appear' or 'to be visible.' Literally, it conveys 'from what is visible/appears, one can conclude that...' However, it is best understood as expressing a reasoned deduction or conclusion based on observable evidence or available information. It translates to 'it seems that,' 'it appears that,' or 'one can conclude that.'\n\nThis expression is always appended directly after the clause that forms the basis of the deduction. When the preceding clause ends with a noun or a な-adjective, it requires だ before とみえる. For example, 「学生だ とみえる」(it seems to be a student) or 「静かだ とみえる」(it seems to be quiet).\n\nWhile とみえる indicates conjecture, it carries a degree of confidence, implying that the speaker has specific reasons or evidence that led them to this conclusion. It is not a mere guess, but a logical inference drawn from what is perceived. It is generally applicable across registers, though the politeness level of 見える can be adjusted (e.g., とみえます for polite forms).\n\nThe particle と, in this context, functions to \"sum up\" the preceding clause as a direct conclusion. This is similar to how と marks a quotation (summing up what was said or thought) or accompanies things that are 'together' (summing up a group of items or people).",

        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key to differentiating 「とみえる」 from similar expressions lies in its implication of a reasoned deduction. Unlike 「ようだ」 or 「らしい」, which can convey a sense of uncertainty, indirect information, or characteristic behavior, 「とみえる」 suggests that the speaker has considered available information and arrived at a relatively confident conclusion based on observable evidence. 「に見える」, on the other hand, focuses on visual appearance, describing how something looks rather than a logical inference about its state or cause.",
