    "writeup": "「とみえる」 (typically written in hiragana) combines the particle 「と」 with the verb 「見える(みえる)」 (to appear, to be visible). The particle 「と」 marks a conclusion or deduction. Thus, 「とみえる」 literally means \"from the way it appears, one can conclude that...\" It conveys a sense of reasoned judgment based on observable evidence. It can be translated as \"it seems that,\" \"it appears that,\" or \"one can conclude that.\" Nouns and な-adjectives require 「だ」 before 「とみえる」. The speaker has a reason to make this deduction.",
