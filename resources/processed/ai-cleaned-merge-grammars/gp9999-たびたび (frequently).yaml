jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: adverb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Describes actions or events that happen repeatedly and with some regularity. Can sometimes
    carry a nuance of slight annoyance or something unexpected happening repeatedly.
  function: Modifies verbs, adjectives, or entire clauses to indicate high frequency.
  nuance: Implies a noticeable, sometimes bothersome, repetition. More specific about recurrence than
    よく.
etymology: The term たびたび is a reduplication of たび (度), meaning 'time' or 'occurrence.' This repetition,
  a common linguistic device in Japanese (重語 - jōgo), serves to emphasize the repeated nature of an action
  or event, much like 時々 (sometimes) or 日々 (day by day). This structure inherently conveys the meaning
  of 'time and again' or 'repeatedly,' thereby evolving to signify 'frequently.'
writeup: |-
  たびたび is an adverb that expresses that an action or event occurs **frequently** or **repeatedly**. It emphasizes the notion of "many times" or "each time." While often translated simply as "frequently" or "often," it carries a nuance of something happening with noticeable recurrence. This can sometimes imply a recurring pattern, or in certain contexts, even a slight sense of annoyance or something unexpected happening repeatedly.

  It is generally used to modify verbs, indicating that the action happens repeatedly. It can also describe a state that is frequently observed. たびたび often highlights distinct, separate occurrences rather than a continuous or ceaseless state.

  To grasp its specific nuance, it is helpful to compare たびたび with similar words such as よく, しばしば, 何度も, and 頻繁に. たびたび tends to be a bit more personal or subjective than the more formal 頻繁に。
false_friends:
  - term: よく
    meaning: often; frequently; well; skillfully
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: よく is a more general adverb of frequency and manner. It can mean "well" or "skillfully" in
      addition to "often." たびたび specifically emphasizes repetition and often implies a noticeable or perhaps
      even slightly bothersome recurrence, whereas よく is more neutral and broad.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:よく (frequently・often)
  - term: しばしば
    meaning: often; frequently
    kind: synonym
    nuance: しばしば is a very close synonym to たびたび in meaning "often" or "frequently." However, しばしば tends
      to be more formal or literary in tone compared to たびたび, which is more common in everyday speech.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:しばしば (often・frequently)
  - term: 何度も
    meaning: many times; over and over again
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 何度も explicitly emphasizes the count of repetitions, meaning "many times." たびたび emphasizes
      the frequency or recurring nature, without necessarily focusing on the exact number of instances.
      何度も can imply a more exhaustive repetition than たびたび.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:何度も (many times)
  - term: 頻繁に
    meaning: frequently; often; constantly
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 頻繁に (ひんぱんに) is a more formal and objective term for high frequency. It sounds more like a
      statistic or observation. たびたび can carry a more subjective feeling, sometimes with a nuance of slight
      exasperation or a pattern being noticed.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:頻繁に (frequently)
  - term: 常に
    meaning: always; constantly; habitually
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 常に indicates something happening "always" or "constantly," implying a higher and more continuous
      level of frequency than たびたび. たびたび suggests frequent, but not necessarily ceaseless, occurrences.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:常に (always・constantly)
post_false_friends_writeup: When choosing between たびたび と its similar expressions, consider the context
  and the nuance you wish to convey. Use たびたび when you want to highlight repeated occurrences, especially
  if there's a slight implication of regularity or a sense of things happening again and again. For a
  more general "often," よく is usually the safest choice. If you want to emphasize the sheer number of
  times, 何度も is more appropriate. For formal or objective discussions of high frequency, 頻繁に fits better.
  Lastly, しばしば is a good alternative when aiming for a slightly more literary or formal tone than たびたび。
