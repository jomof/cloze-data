jlpt: N4
etymology: 'The grammatical suffix 「そう」 originates from the noun 「様」(さま), meaning ''appearance'' or ''state''.
  This historical connection highlights its primary function: describing how something appears to the
  observer, based on direct sensory information.'
writeup: |-
  The grammatical pattern 「そうだ」 is primarily used to express that something *seems* or *looks like* a certain way, based on the speaker's direct sensory perception, most commonly visual observation. It conveys an immediate impression or an imminent action.

  When attached to **verb stems**, 「そうだ」 indicates that an action appears to be about to happen or is likely to occur. For instance, 「雨が降りそうだ」 means "It looks like it's going to rain," implying a direct observation of the sky or weather conditions.

  When attached to the **stems of い-adjectives**, 「そうだ」 describes how something *looks* or *appears* to possess that quality. For example, 「楽しそうだ」 (looks fun) suggests that you observe someone's demeanor or an event, and it gives you the impression of being fun. A key exception is the adjective 「いい」 (good), which irregularly becomes 「よさそうだ」 (looks good).

  Similarly, when used with **な-adjectives**, 「そうだ」 conveys appearance. The 「な」 is dropped before 「そうだ」, as in 「元気そうだ」 (looks healthy) from 「元気な」. This usage also relies on direct observation.

  It is crucial to distinguish this 「そうだ」 (observation) from the other 「そうだ」 (hearsay), which reports information heard from others. While they share the same phonetic form, their usage and meaning are distinct. The observational 「そうだ」 relies on immediate, empirical evidence, while the hearsay 「そうだ」 relies on reported information.
false_friends:
  - term: '[Sentence]そうだ (i heard・it is said)'
    meaning: I hear that..., it is said that...
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: This form of 「そうだ」 reports information heard from others, not direct observation. It connects
      to the plain form of verbs, adjectives, and nouns. For example, 「雨が降るそうだ」 (I hear it will rain)
      is based on a report, while 「雨が降りそうだ」 (It looks like it will rain) is based on visual cues.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Sentence]そうだ (I heard・it is said)
  - term: 〜ようだ・〜みたいだ (seems・like)
    meaning: It seems that..., it looks like... (based on conjecture, impression, or similarity)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「そうだ」 (which is based on direct observation), 「ようだ」 and 「みたいだ」 express a judgment based
      on vague information, a personal impression, or a comparison. They imply a less direct, more inferential
      conclusion, often like "it seems *as if*...".
    grammar_point: 〜ようだ・〜みたいだ (seems・like)
  - term: 〜らしい
    meaning: It seems that..., apparently..., typical of... (based on indirect evidence or what one has
      heard)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「らしい」 indicates a conclusion drawn from indirect evidence, common knowledge, or what one has
      heard, often with a nuance of "it's characteristic of X." It is less about direct visual appearance
      than 「そうだ」.
    grammar_point: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)'
  - term: とみえる
    meaning: It appears that..., it seems that... (based on observable facts, leading to a logical conclusion)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「そうだ」 describes an immediate, superficial appearance, 「とみえる」 implies a reasoned deduction
      based on visual or factual evidence. It suggests a stronger sense of certainty or a logical conclusion
      drawn from observed facts.
    grammar_point: とみえる (seems from observation)
  - term: 〜げ
    meaning: Seeming..., appearing to be... (often used for emotions or inner states)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜げ」 is similar to 「そうだ」 in expressing appearance, but it often conveys a *slight* or *subtle*
      appearance, particularly for internal feelings that manifest outwardly. It is commonly used with
      adjectives describing emotions. For example, 「悲しげ」 (looks slightly sad) vs. 「悲しそうだ」 (looks overtly
      sad).
    grammar_point: げ (seeming・appearance)
  - term: そうにない・そうもない
    meaning: unlikely to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is the negative form related to 「そうだ」, indicating that something does not look like it
      will happen or is unlikely to happen, based on observation.
    grammar_point: そうにない・そうもない (unlikely to)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusing 「そうだ」 with similar expressions, remember that this 「そうだ」
  is about immediate, direct observation. If you see dark clouds, you use 「雨が降りそうだ」. If you hear a weather
  report, you use the hearsay 「雨が降るそうだ」. If you are making a less certain conjecture or a comparison,
  「ようだ」 or 「みたいだ」 are more appropriate. 「らしい」 suggests a conclusion based on indirect evidence or what
  is characteristic. 「とみえる」 implies a more logical deduction from observed facts, while 「〜げ」 indicates
  a subtle appearance, often of an internal state.
