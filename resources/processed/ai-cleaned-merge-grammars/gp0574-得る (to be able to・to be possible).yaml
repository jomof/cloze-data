formation:
  Verb[ます-stem] + 得る: Indicates that something is possible or can happen, often expressing a logical or
    inherent possibility.
jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: formal
  usage-context: Expresses logical possibility, inherent capability, or conceivability. Frequently used
    in academic, legal, or journalistic contexts, and often found in written Japanese.
  function: Expresses potentiality or possibility.
  nuance: More formal and objective than 「〜することができる」. It often describes things that are *conceivable*
    or *logically possible* rather than a direct personal ability. It can also imply a *potential* for
    something to happen. It is less about a physical or learned ability and more about the inherent nature
    of a situation or concept.
  counterpoint: Contrasts with 「〜ことができない」 which denotes a lack of general ability, and 「〜かねる」 which denotes
    difficulty or reluctance to do something.
etymology: The auxiliary verb 「得る」(eru/uru) derives from the main verb 「得る」(える), meaning "to get" or "to
  obtain." Over time, its auxiliary use evolved to signify the "ability to obtain" or "possibility of
  achieving" a state or action when appended to the ます-stem of another verb. This semantic shift from
  physical acquisition to abstract potential reflects a common linguistic phenomenon where verbs of gaining
  or reaching can also express capability. The two common readings, 「える」 and 「うる」, often differentiate
  its use as a main verb (える) versus an auxiliary verb (うる, especially in dictionary form) or other forms
  (える).
writeup: |-
  The auxiliary verb 「得る」 (える/うる) is attached to the ます-stem of another verb to express that something is possible or can happen. It indicates a logical, inherent, or theoretical possibility, rather than a personal or learned ability. This makes it distinct from 「〜することができる」, which is a more general expression for ability or possibility.

  「得る」 is often used in more formal or objective contexts, such as academic papers, news reports, or legal documents. It implies that a situation, event, or action is conceivable, feasible, or within the realm of possibility based on objective factors or logic.

  When using 「得る」, pay attention to its two common readings: the dictionary form as an auxiliary verb is typically read 「うる」 (e.g., ありうる, しうる), while other conjugated forms are read 「える」 (e.g., 得ない (えない), 得た (えた)).

  The negative form, 「〜得ない」 (〜えない), means "cannot" or "is impossible." Like its positive counterpart, it conveys a sense of logical impossibility or inconceivability, a strong assertion that something simply cannot or will not happen.

  - term: 〜することができる
    meaning: to be able to; can
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜することができる」 expresses general ability or possibility, often related to personal skills or
      situational allowance. 「〜し得る」 is more formal and indicates inherent, logical, or theoretical possibility,
      often used for things that *can* or *cannot* happen generally, or a *potential* outcome in a broader
      sense.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:するすることができる (can・be able to)
  - term: 〜かねる
    meaning: cannot; find it difficult to; hesitate to
    kind: antonym
    nuance: While 「〜し得る」 indicates possibility or ability, 「〜かねる」 denotes the difficulty or impossibility
      of performing an action, often due to social constraints, reluctance, or inherent difficulty. It
      expresses an inability or unwillingness to do something.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[stem]かねる (unable to・hesitant to)
  - term: 〜やすい・〜にくい
    meaning: easy to do / difficult to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜やすい・〜にくい」 describes the *ease* or *difficulty* of an action from a general perspective or
      inherent characteristic of the object/situation. 「〜し得る」 focuses purely on the *possibility* or *capability*
      of an action, without necessarily implying ease or difficulty.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]にくい (difficult to do)'
post_false_friends_writeup: 'When considering 「得る」, it is crucial to distinguish it from other expressions
  of possibility or difficulty. While 「〜することができる」 conveys a general ability or situational possibility,
  「得る」 often speaks to a more fundamental or logical possibility, particularly in formal or written contexts.
  For instance, 「この問題は解決し得る」 (This problem can be resolved) suggests that resolution is inherently possible,
  whereas 「この問題を解決することができる」 (One can resolve this problem) might imply someone possesses the skill to
  do so. Furthermore, do not confuse 「得る」 with 「〜かねる」. Though both are auxiliary verbs attached to a verb''s
  ます-stem, 「〜かねる」 conveys the opposite: a difficulty or unwillingness to perform an action (e.g., 「承知しかねます」
  - I cannot agree). Lastly, 「〜やすい・〜にくい」 describes the inherent ease or difficulty of an action (e.g.,
  「食べやすい」 - easy to eat), which is a different dimension from the sheer possibility conveyed by 「得る」.'
examples:
  - english: Such a situation can certainly happen.
    japanese:
      - そう いう 事態 は {あり 得る}。
      - そう いう 事態 は {あり 得 ます}。

          - そう いう 事態 は 起こる こと が できる。
        english: Such a situation can happen (general possibility).
        hint: 「〜することができる」 expresses a general ability or possibility, but 「あり得る」 specifically means "it's
          conceivable" or "it's possible" in a more inherent, objective sense, and is more formal. We're
          looking for a formal, objective statement of possibility.
    scene: A professor explaining complex systems to students.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「あり得る」 is a very common phrase meaning "it's possible" or "it can happen." It implies a logical
      or inherent possibility rather than a personal ability. This phrasing lends a sense of authoritative
      explanation, fitting for an academic setting.

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - それ は でき ない こと だ。
        english: That is something that cannot be done (general inability).
        hint: 「できない」 is a general negative capability, often implying a lack of skill or means. 「あり得ない」
          expresses a stronger, fundamental impossibility or inconceivability. We're looking for a statement
          of absolute impossibility.
    scene: A detective dismissing a far-fetched theory.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)

          - 人間 は 自然 と 共存 する こと が できる。
        english: Human beings are able to coexist with nature (general capacity).
        hint: 「〜することができる」 is more about general capacity. 「〜し得る」 emphasizes the inherent potential or
          logical possibility. We're looking for a formal statement about inherent potential.
    scene: A keynote speaker at an environmental conference.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)

        english: I cannot understand his actions (general inability).
        hint: 「理解できない」 can mean you lack the personal capacity to understand. 「理解し得ない」 implies a deeper,
          inherent impossibility of understanding, perhaps because the actions are beyond rational comprehension.
          We're looking for a statement about inherent impossibility of understanding.
    scene: A psychologist discussing a complex case with a colleague.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    nuance: 「理解し得ない」 implies a fundamental impossibility or extreme difficulty in comprehending, suggesting
      it's beyond one's capacity or logical framework. This level of nuance is appropriate in a professional,
      analytical discussion.

        hint: 「できる」 questions general feasibility or personal ability. 「し得る」 challenges the inherent feasibility
          or logical possibility of the action. We're looking for a question about fundamental possibility.
    scene: A skeptical committee member questioning the feasibility of a new proposal.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)

        english: One should always be able to consider all possibilities (general capacity).
        hint: 「〜することができる」 focuses on the ability to perform the action. 「考慮し得る」 here means "capable of
          being considered" or "possible to consider," suggesting a comprehensive and exhaustive approach
          to thought, fitting a philosophical instruction. We're looking for a formal statement about
          what is fundamentally possible to consider.

        english: I cannot accept such a proposal (general inability or refusal).
        hint: 「受け入れられない」 can be a simple statement of inability or refusal. 「受け入れ得ない」 conveys a strong,
          fundamental impossibility of acceptance, often implying it goes against principles or is logically
          unfeasible. We're looking for a statement of absolute impossibility of acceptance.
    scene: A CEO firmly rejecting a business offer that goes against company values.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: 「受け入れ得ない」 conveys a strong, firm impossibility of acceptance, often implying it goes against
      principles or is logically unfeasible. The use of this formal and definitive phrase, especially
      from a male CEO, reinforces a position of authority and conviction.
  - english: In rare cases, such an error can occur.
    japanese:
      - 稀 に その よう な エラー が {起こり 得る}。

        english: In rare cases, such an error can occur (general possibility).
        hint: 「〜することができる」 implies a general capacity. 「起こり得る」 signifies that while uncommon, the error
          is within the realm of logical possibility or conceivability, fitting a technical explanation.
          We're looking for a formal description of a potential, albeit rare, occurrence.
    scene: A software engineer explaining a rare bug to a client.
    register: formal
    setting: technical
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「起こり得る」 signifies that while uncommon, the error is within the realm of possibility or conceivability.
      This objective and technical phrasing is appropriate for explaining a system's behavior to a client.
post_example_writeup: As demonstrated by the examples, 「得る」 is primarily used in formal or objective contexts
  to discuss inherent or logical possibilities. Its negative form, 「〜得ない」, provides a strong assertion
  of impossibility. While 「〜することができる」 is a versatile phrase for general ability, 「得る」 offers a more specific
  nuance of objective possibility, often seen in written or analytical Japanese.
