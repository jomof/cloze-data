formation:
  Verb [ます-stem] + 得る/うる/える: Indicates the possibility of something happening or being able to do something.
  あり得る (ありうる/ありえる): Indicates that something is possible or can exist. Must be used with verbs that imply
    existence or state, such as ある or 起こる. In this case, える refers to the auxiliary verb.
jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used in formal, literary, or emphatic contexts to express inherent potential or achievability,
    or a strong sense of impossibility.
  function: Expresses possibility, potential, or inherent capability.
  nuance: More formal and emphasizes inherent possibility or achievability compared to できる or the potential
    form.
  grammatical-role: Suffixal auxiliary verb
etymology: The verb 「得る(える)」 originally meant "to obtain" or "to acquire." Its usage as a potential auxiliary
  verb (得る/うる) evolved from this, suggesting the gaining or acquiring of the *ability* to do something.
  Over time, it came to simply indicate possibility or capability.
writeup: |-
  The auxiliary verb 「得る (える/うる)」 derives from the Godan verb 「得る」, which fundamentally means "to obtain" or "to acquire." When attached to the ます-stem of other verbs, it functions as an auxiliary verb. In this form, it expresses the possibility or capability of something, meaning "(A) is achievable" or "one can do (A)." For instance, while 「できる」 indicates general ability or possibility, 「得る」 focuses on a more specific or potential capability, implying that "the possibility for (A) to occur has arisen" or "the ability to do (A) has been acquired" under certain circumstances.

  There are two common readings for 「得る」 in its auxiliary form: 「える」 and 「うる」. 「うる」 is a more archaic expression often seen in literature and less frequently spoken in modern everyday conversation, where 「える」 is generally preferred. However, if the preceding kana is an 'e' sound (from the 'e' column of the kana table), as in 「教える」 becoming 「教えうる」, 「うる」 tends to be the favored pronunciation.

  Compared to 「できる」, 「得る」 carries a more formal and literary tone. Nevertheless, certain idiomatic expressions like 「あり得る (ありうる)」 ("possible" or "can exist") and 「あり得ない (ありえない)」 ("impossible" or "no way") are frequently used even in daily conversation.
false_friends:
  - term: れる・られる (Potential)
    meaning: To be able, Can (Potential)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「れる・られる」(potential form) expresses general ability or the possibility of an action,
      「得る」 focuses on the inherent achievability or potential capability under specific circumstances.
    grammar_point: られる (ability)
  - term: できる
    meaning: To be able to, Can (general ability)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「できる」 expresses general ability or possibility and is more colloquial, used in a wide range
      of contexts. In contrast, 「得る」 focuses on specific achievability or potential capability, implying
      that the possibility for (A) to occur has arisen. It carries a more formal, literary tone.
    grammar_point: できる (general ability)
  - term: 可能性がある
    meaning: There is a possibility
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「可能性がある」 directly states the existence of a possibility. However, 「得る」 connects to a verb
      and carries a stronger nuance that the action is "inherently possible" or achievable.
    grammar_point: 可能性がある (there is a possibility)
  - term: かもしれない
    meaning: Might, maybe, perhaps
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「かもしれない」 indicates conjecture or uncertain possibility. 「得る」 expresses a more definite, achievable
      possibility or capability, rather than mere speculation.
    grammar_point: かもしれない (might)
  - term: なることもある
    meaning: Sometimes becomes, it can happen that...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「なることもある」 refers to frequency or incidental occurrences. In contrast, 「得る」 implies an inherent
      possibility or a potential danger contained within the matter itself, rather than just occasional
      happenstance.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-dictionary]ことがある (there are times when)'
  - term: 不可能だ
    meaning: Impossible, not possible
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「不可能だ」 is a direct and strong statement of impossibility. While similar to 「〜得ない」, 「あり得ない」
      (derived from 得る) often carries an added nuance of unacceptably impossibility or something being
      unreasonable, beyond mere factual impossibility.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:不可能だ (impossible)
  - term: 可能だ
    meaning: Possible
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「可能だ」 is a direct adjective meaning "possible" or "feasible," often used as a direct statement.
      「得る」, as an auxiliary verb, attaches to verbs to express inherent achievability or potential of
      an action, emphasizing the capability within the verb's context.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:可能だ (possible)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, understand that while 「れる・られる」 also expresses ability,
  「得る」 carries a distinct nuance of inherent achievability or potential capability that is not present
  in the more general potential form. Similarly, 「できる」 expresses general capability, while 「得る」 emphasizes
  a more specific, sometimes profound, possibility. Expressions like 「可能性がある」 and 「かもしれない」 state possibility
  or conjecture, but 「得る」 often points to a more fundamental or inherent potential. When comparing 「なることもある」
  to 「得る」, the former refers to occasional occurrences, whereas the latter suggests an intrinsic possibility
  or a latent danger. While 「不可能だ」 states impossibility directly, 「あり得ない」 often conveys a strong emotional
  rejection of something as unreasonable or utterly unacceptable. Lastly, 「可能だ」 is a direct adjective
  for 'possible', whereas 「得る」 functions as an auxiliary verb attached to other verbs, highlighting the
  inherent capability of performing that specific action.

        english: Please propose the best possible plan that can be thought of.
        hint: 「られる」 indicates general possibility. 「得る」 emphasizes the inherent achievability or potential
          capability through thorough consideration. We're looking for an emphasis on thorough consideration.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 考える {可能 性 が ある} 最善 の 策 を 提案 し て ください。
        english: Please propose the best plan that has the possibility of being thought of.
        hint: 「可能性がある」 states the existence of a possibility. We're looking for a grammar point that directly
          modifies the verb to imply inherent achievability rather than stating a possibility.
    scene: A senior executive asks a junior team member to present a solution.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The use of 「考え {得る}」 implies a thorough and exhaustive consideration of all possibilities,
      emphasizing the comprehensiveness of the proposed solution, expressing a higher level of expectation
      and effort than a simple 「考えられる」. It's often used when speaking about solutions that can realistically
      be achieved, given the effort put in. This expresses a higher level of confidence in the outcome
      and the process to achieve it.
  - english: That kind of story can't possibly be true!

      - competing_japanese:
          - そんな 話 は {不 可能 だ}！
        english: That kind of story is impossible!
        hint: 「不可能だ」 is a direct statement of impossibility. 「あり得ない」 often conveys a strong emotional
          rejection or incredulity, implying something is unreasonable and beyond belief. We're looking
          for that stronger emotional nuance.
      - competing_japanese:
          - そんな 話、あり え ない {か も しれ ない}。
        english: That kind of story might not be true.
        hint: 「かもしれない」 expresses uncertain possibility or conjecture. We're looking for a strong, definite
          assertion of impossibility, not mere speculation.
    scene: A young man reacts incredulously to a friend's far-fetched story.
    register: casual
    setting: excited
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    nuance: The phrase 「あり {得る} わけ ない」 carries a stronger sense of disbelief and impossibility than just
      「あり得ない」, emphasizing the speaker's strong feeling that 'there's no way that could happen'. This
      casual expression reflects disbelief and strong emotional reaction. The use of 「わけ ない」 amplifies
      the impossibility, making it an emphatic denial of what was said.

        english: This technology holds the potential to be able to significantly change medicine in the
          future.

          of potential.
    scene: A researcher presenting a groundbreaking discovery at a conference.

    setting: academic
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「変え {得る}」 highlights the inherent transformative power and potential of the technology, suggesting

      is suitable for an academic presentation, emphasizing the profound and fundamental capacity for
      change.

        english: His words and actions are no longer forgivable; they are impossible.
        hint: 「不可能だ」 is an objective statement of impossibility. 「あり得ない」 carries a stronger emotional
          and moral rejection, suggesting that the behavior is unacceptable and against all reason. We're
          looking for that sense of outrage or deep disappointment.
    scene: A person expressing deep disapproval about someone's behavior.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    nuance: 「あり {得 ない}」 in this context implies not just physical impossibility, but a strong emotional
      and moral rejection, suggesting that the behavior is unacceptable and against all reason. It expresses
      a deeper sense of outrage or disappointment than a simple 「不可能だ」. It conveys that such behavior
      is fundamentally outside the realm of what should be considered possible or acceptable.

      - competing_japanese:
          - この 件 に つい て、もう 少し 詳しく 説明 {でき ます} か？
        english: Can you explain this matter in a bit more detail?
        hint: 「できます」 is a common, direct way to ask about ability. 「説明し得ますか」 is a more polite and deferential
          inquiry into the feasibility or possibility of the explanation, showing consideration for the
          subordinate's situation. We're looking for that added layer of politeness and consideration.
    scene: A manager politely asking a subordinate for more information.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: The use of 「説明し {得ます} か」 is a more polite and deferential way of asking for an explanation
      compared to 「説明できますか」. It queries the *feasibility* or *possibility* of the explanation, showing
      consideration for the subordinate's situation and adding a layer of politeness suitable for professional
      settings. This implies respect for the listener's capacity and time.

    scene: A coach describing the resilience of an athlete.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「打ち勝ち {得る}」 emphasizes the intrinsic ability and potential to overcome difficulties, conveying

      observed in professional male discourse when discussing capabilities. It highlights a fundamental
      capacity within her character.

          stronger sense of intrinsic ability.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: Grandpa still has the physical strength to be able to climb mountains.

    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The casual address 「おじいちゃん」 (grandpa) immediately establishes the speaker as younger than
      the person being talked about. The use of 「登り {得る} 体力」 highlights that his strength is not just
      present, but inherently sufficient for the challenge of climbing, emphasizing his enduring capability
      despite his age. The sentence uses a conversational tone appropriate for casual family discussion,
      subtly praising his persistent vitality.
  - english: Even if it seems impossible now, it's a goal that can be achieved through hard work.

        english: Even if it seems impossible now, it's a goal that can be achieved through hard work.
        hint: 「できる」 expresses general ability or possibility. 「得る」 emphasizes the inherent achievability
          of the goal given sufficient effort, highlighting a more certain potential. We're looking for
          that nuance of inherent potential.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今 は 無理 だ と 思え て も、努力 すれ ば 達成 の {可能 性 が ある} 目標 です。
        english: Even if it seems impossible now, it's a goal that has the possibility of being achieved
          through hard work.
        hint: 「可能性 が ある」 states the existence of a possibility. 「得る」 directly attaches to the verb to
          imply the inherent capacity for achievement, rather than just a potential outcome. We're looking
          for that directness and inherent capacity.
    scene: A mentor encouraging a mentee who feels overwhelmed by a challenging task.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: inspirational
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: 「達成 し {得る}」 emphasizes that the goal is inherently achievable with effort, providing a stronger
      sense of confidence and potential than a simple 「達成できる」. It encourages the listener by stressing
      the inherent possibility within the task itself, given perseverance. This phrasing conveys a deeper
      conviction in the mentee's capacity for success.
  - english: After such an incident, it is difficult to restore trust.
    japanese:

    english_literally: After such an incident, trust cannot be recovered, probably.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あんな 事件 の 後 で は、信頼 を 回復 する {こと が でき ない} でしょう。
        english: After such an incident, it isn't possible to restore trust.
        hint: 「できない」 indicates general inability. 「得ない」 conveys a stronger, more inherent impossibility
          or unrecoverability of trust due to the nature of the incident itself. We're looking for that
          deeper sense of intrinsic impossibility.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あんな 事件 の 後 で は、信頼 を 回復 する の は {不 可能 でしょう}。
        english: After such an incident, restoring trust is probably impossible.
        hint: 「不可能」 is a direct statement of impossibility. 「得ない」, especially with 「でしょう」, implies a strong,
          almost regrettable, inherent impossibility or unacceptability. We're looking for that nuance
          of intrinsic unlikelihood, often with a hint of resignation.
    scene: Two colleagues discussing the severe consequences of a breach of ethics in their company.
    register: formal
    setting: melancholic
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    nuance: The phrase 「回復 し {得 ない} でしょう」 conveys a strong sense of inherent impossibility, implying that
      the damage to trust is so profound that restoration is fundamentally unachievable, rather than merely
      difficult. The addition of 「でしょう」 softens the assertion while still maintaining a conclusive tone,
      often reflecting a sense of resignation or shared understanding of the grim reality. It suggests
      that the very nature of the incident precludes recovery.
post_example_writeup: As demonstrated in the examples, 「得る・うる」 is consistently used to emphasize an inherent
  or fundamental possibility or impossibility, often in situations requiring deeper consideration or implying
  significant impact. The choice between 「える」 and 「うる」 sometimes reflects the preceding sound, but in
  modern Japanese, 「える」 is generally more common, especially in spoken language, while 「うる」 often retains
  a more literary or formal feel, particularly after verbs whose ます-stem ends in an 'e' sound. This nuance
  helps differentiate it from more general expressions of ability like 「できる」 or the potential form.
