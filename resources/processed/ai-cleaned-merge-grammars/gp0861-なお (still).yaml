The 「今もなお」construction emphasizes the persistence of something up to the present moment.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「なお」, when used at the beginning of a statement, often carries the meaning of \"still,\" \"even,\" or \"yet.\" This usage is frequently observed after a previous statement ends in 「も」, emphasizing that even after (A), (B) is still true. This is especially common when the information in (B) is surprising or shocking. 「なお」is a formal grammar structure. 「今もなお」is often used as a set phrase.",
