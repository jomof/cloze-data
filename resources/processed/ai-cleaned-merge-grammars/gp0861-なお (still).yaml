    "etymology": "The word 「なお」originally meant \"in addition to\" or \"furthermore.\" Over time, it also came to express the idea of something continuing or remaining in a certain state, even after other factors have come into play. The 「今もなお」construction emphasizes the persistence of something up to the present moment.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「なお」is primarily used to convey the sense of \"still,\" \"even,\" or \"yet.\" It emphasizes the continuation of a state or action, often highlighting that this continuation is surprising or noteworthy given previous circumstances. While it can be written with the kanji 尚, it is most commonly encountered in kana, especially in its adverbial usage.\n\nWhen 「なお」follows a clause ending in 「も」 (e.g., 「〜てもなお」), it strongly emphasizes that despite the condition or situation described in the first clause, the state or action in the second clause persists. This often implies that the persistence is unexpected or particularly significant.\n\n「今もなお」is a very common set phrase, meaning \"even now\" or \"still at present.\" It's frequently used to underline a lasting condition or fact. Furthermore, 「なお」can also indicate an increased degree or quantity, translating to \"even more,\" \"still more,\" or \"yet another.\" This nuance implies that something has progressed to an even greater extent or that an additional amount is involved.\n\nOverall, 「なお」is considered a formal grammatical structure, lending a more refined or literary tone to sentences. It is distinct from its homophone 「なお②」, which functions as a conjunction meaning \"in addition,\" \"incidentally,\" or \"furthermore,\" introducing supplementary information rather than emphasizing continuation.",
