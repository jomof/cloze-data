    "etymology": "The word 「なお」originally meant \"in addition to\" or \"furthermore.\" Over time, it also came to express the idea of something continuing or remaining in a certain state, even after other factors have come into play. The 「今もなお」construction emphasizes the persistence of something up to the present moment.",
    "writeup": "The adverb 「なお」, when placed at the beginning of a statement, conveys the sense of \"still,\" \"even,\" or \"yet.\" It is often employed after a preceding clause ending in 「も」, to emphasize that despite the situation described in the first clause (A), the condition in the second clause (B) remains true or continues. This usage is particularly effective when the information in clause (B) is unexpected or surprising. Although 「なお」can be written with the kanji 尚, it is most commonly encountered in kana. Furthermore, the second clause (B) frequently includes the particle 「も」to highlight that the new information is an additional, persistent aspect, even after (A). The phrase 「今もなお」has become a fixed expression, widely used to emphasize something's persistence up to the present moment. Overall, 「なお」is considered a formal grammatical structure.",

                    "mitigation": "The context of reporting a serious issue like harassment to HR and the subsequent continuation of the problem implies a sense of persistence despite intervention, which 「なお」 uniquely conveys. 'まだ' would imply a simple continuation, lacking the surprise or frustration of the situation."
