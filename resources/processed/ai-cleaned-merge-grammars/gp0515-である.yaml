        "usage-context": "Primarily used in academic papers, official documents, formal speeches, and literary works; sounds stiff in casual conversation.",
        "function": "Serves as a formal copula, connecting nouns or adjectives to express states, attributes, or identities, and also functions as an explanatory or conclusive marker.",
        "nuance": "Imparts an objective, declarative, and authoritative tone, often used for factual statements, definitions, or conclusions. The level of formality can range from simply formal (である) to extremely formal or humorously stiff (であります)."
    },
    "etymology": "「である」 is formed from the conjunctive form (連用形) of 「だ」 (the copula) plus the verb 「ある」 (to be). Over time, it has grammaticalized into a formal equivalent of 「だ」.",
    "writeup": "「である」 is a formal or literary equivalent of 「だ」. It is a combination of the conjunctive form of 「だ」 and the verb 「ある」. While it can replace 「だ」 in most situations, it is predominantly found in formal writing and speech, such as academic papers, official documents, and news reports. Its primary function is to express a state, attribute, or identity in an objective and definitive manner.\n\n**Formality and Usage:**\n*   **General Use:** 「である」 provides an objective, declarative tone, making it suitable for presenting facts, definitions, and conclusions.\n*   **Extreme Formality (であります):** The form 「であります」 is highly formal and can sound excessively stiff or even humorous if used outside of very specific contexts, such as military, police, or certain governmental or business environments where such formality is mandated. Its use in everyday conversation is generally avoided unless for comedic effect.\n*   **Attributive Use:** When connecting nouns with な-adjectives, 「である」 can sometimes replace 「な」 or 「の」. For instance, 「静かである場所」 (a quiet place) is grammatically correct but sounds quite stiff compared to 「静かな場所」. This attributive use reinforces the formal and definitive nature of the statement.",
