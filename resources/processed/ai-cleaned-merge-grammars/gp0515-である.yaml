    "etymology": "「である」is formed from the conjunctive form (連用形) of 「だ」 (the copula) plus the verb 「ある」 (to be). Over time, it has grammaticalized into a formal equivalent of 「だ」.",
    "writeup": "「である」 is a formal or literary equivalent of 「だ」. It's a combination of the conjunctive form of 「だ」 and the verb 「ある」. While it can replace 「だ」 in most situations, it is more common in formal writing and speech.\n\n*   **Formality:** 「である」 and the even more formal 「であります」 are often used in situations requiring a high degree of formality, such as legal documents, academic papers, and formal speeches. Using 「であります」 in casual conversation can sound stiff or humorous.\n*   **Literary Usage:** You'll find 「である」 frequently in books, essays, and other written works.\n*   **Replacing な and の:** When connecting nouns with な-adjectives, 「である」 can replace 「な」 or 「の」, but this is less common in modern spoken Japanese. For example, you can say 「静かである場所」 instead of 「静かな場所」, but it sounds very formal.",
