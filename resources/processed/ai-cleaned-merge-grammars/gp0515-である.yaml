        "usage-context": "Primarily used in academic papers, official documents, formal speeches, and literary works; sounds stiff in casual conversation.",

        "nuance": "Imparts an objective, declarative, and authoritative tone, often used for factual statements, definitions, or conclusions. The level of formality can range from simply formal (である) to extremely formal or humorously stiff (であります)."
    },
    "etymology": "「である」 is formed from the conjunctive form (連用形) of 「だ」 (the copula) plus the verb 「ある」 (to be). Over time, it has grammaticalized into a formal equivalent of 「だ」.",
    "writeup": "「である」 serves as a formal or literary equivalent of 「だ」. It is fundamentally a combination of the conjunctive form of 「だ」 and the verb 「ある」. While it can theoretically substitute 「だ」 in most contexts, its primary domain is formal written and spoken Japanese, including academic papers, official reports, and news broadcasts. Its core function is to express a state, attribute, or identity in an objective and definitive manner, lending an authoritative tone to statements.\n\n**Formality and Usage Nuances:**\n*   **Objective Tone:** 「である」 is ideal for presenting facts, definitions, and conclusions, as it conveys an objective, declarative tone.\n*   **Extreme Formality (であります):** The variant 「であります」 represents a significantly higher level of formality. Its use is largely confined to highly hierarchical environments such as the military, law enforcement, or certain governmental and corporate settings where such extreme politeness or humility is strictly observed. In everyday conversation, 「であります」 would sound overly stiff or even deliberately humorous, often used to mock seriousness in trivial situations.\n*   **Attributive Use:** 「である」 can also be used attributively, particularly with nouns and な-adjectives, to modify another noun. For instance, 「重要である項目」 (important items) carries a more formal and definitive nuance than the more common 「重要な項目」. However, this usage can sound excessively rigid in standard conversation and is typically reserved for formal writing.",
