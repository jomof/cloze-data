    "etymology": "The phrase 「というのは事実だ」 is composed of: 「という」 (a quotative particle combined with the verb 「言う」 (to say), nominalizing the preceding clause), 「の」 (a nominalizer), 「は」 (the topic marker), 「事実」 (fact), and 「だ」 (the copula 'is'). Thus, it literally translates to \"That which is said is a fact.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「というのは事実だ」 is used to emphatically state that something is a confirmed fact. The phrase 「というのは」 nominalizes the preceding clause, and when combined with 「事実だ」, asserts that the clause is indeed a fact. You may also see this expression with 「という」 omitted, resulting in a slightly less emphatic tone. For example, instead of saying 「彼女が弁護士だというのは事実だ」, you can also say 「彼女が弁護士なのは事実だ」, which is a bit less emphatic. You can use this grammar point with nouns, verbs in dictionary form, and adjectives.",
