    "etymology": "「という」 is a particle used to quote or define something. 「の」 nominalizes the preceding phrase, turning it into a noun. 「は」 is a topic marker. 「事実」 means 'fact.' 「だ」 is the copula 'is'. Thus, the entire phrase literally translates to 'that which is [stated] is a fact'.",
    "writeup": "「〜というのは事実だ」is a phrase used to strongly express that something is 'true', 'a fact', or has 'no doubt'. 「というのは」 may be used after almost any phrase. Pairing the noun 「事実」 'truth' with the auxiliary verb 「だ」 (or 「です」) affirms that phrase to be a fact. The literal translation of 「というのは事実だ」 is 'that which is (A) is true', where (A) is a nominalized phrase. It is also quite common to see this expression with 「という」 omitted, with the only difference being a slightly weaker tone. The kanji required for JLPT N3 are marked with 「†」:  事実†, 母†, 殺†, 赤†, 信†, 経†, 新†, 細菌†, 発見†, 地球†, 丸†, 前科†, 科†, 歴†.",
