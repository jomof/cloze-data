    "etymology": "The word 「かなり」 originally comes from 「可也」, and more recently 「可成」. Both of these expressions mean something similar to \"to become undeniable,\" with the former structure using an older kanji for 'to become' 「也」. 「かなり」 is still used this way today, highlighting that the amount/existence of something has reached a point that cannot be denied. 「かなり」 may be seen with this meaning when carrying either positive and negative connotations.",
    "writeup": "「かなり」 is an adverb used to convey a 'considerable' amount or degree of something. It's often translated as 'quite', 'fairly', 'considerably', or 'pretty'. It almost always appears directly before a phrase or directly before a noun, in which case 「の」 comes between the noun and 「かなり」.\n\nIt emphasizes that the amount or degree of something is significant and noteworthy.",
