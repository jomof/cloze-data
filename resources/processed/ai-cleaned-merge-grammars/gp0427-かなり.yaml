        "かなり + [Noun]": "Modifies the noun to indicate a considerable degree or amount.",

    "etymology": "The word 「かなり」 originally comes from 「可也」, and more recently 「可成」. Both of these expressions mean something similar to \"to become undeniable,\" with the former structure using an older kanji for 'to become' 「也」. 「かなり」 is still used this way today, highlighting that the amount/existence of something has reached a point that cannot be denied. 「かなり」 may be seen with this meaning when carrying either positive and negative connotations.",
    "writeup": "「かなり」 is an adverb used to convey a 'considerable' amount or degree of something. It's often translated as 'quite', 'fairly', 'considerably', or 'pretty'. It almost always appears directly before a phrase or directly before a noun, in which case 「の」 comes between the noun and 「かなり」.\n\nIt emphasizes that the amount or degree of something is significant and noteworthy. This nuance comes from its etymological roots, meaning something has reached a point where its existence or quantity cannot be denied.",

            "meaning": "Very, extremely",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「とても」 is a general intensifier meaning 'very' or 'extremely'. Unlike 「かなり」, it does not carry the nuance of being noteworthy or beyond expectation. It simply states a high degree."

        {
            "term": "すごく",
            "meaning": "Very, incredibly (colloquial)",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「すごく」 is a more colloquial and often subjective intensifier than 「かなり」. While it also means 'very', it tends to express the speaker's strong personal feeling or surprise rather than an objective assessment of a considerable degree."
        },
        {
            "term": "ずいぶん",
            "meaning": "Quite, considerably (often with surprise)",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「ずいぶん」 is similar to 「かなり」 in meaning 'quite' or 'considerably', but it often carries a nuance of surprise that the degree is higher than expected. 「かなり」 is more neutral, stating a fact of substantiality, whereas 「ずいぶん」 might imply a discovery or realization."
        },
        {
            "term": "たいへん",
            "meaning": "Very, awfully, terribly (can imply difficulty)",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「たいへん」 can also mean 'very' or 'considerably', but it is often used in more formal contexts and can carry a nuance of difficulty, trouble, or effort. While it can intensify, 「かなり」 focuses more on the sheer amount or degree, independent of inherent difficulty."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When choosing between 「かなり」 and similar intensifiers like 「とても」, 「すごく」, 「ずいぶん」, or 「たいへん」, consider the specific nuance you wish to convey. Use 「かなり」 when you want to emphasize that something has reached a notable, significant, or considerable degree that cannot be easily dismissed. If you simply want to say 'very,' 「とても」 or 「すごく」 might be more appropriate. If there's an element of surprise, 「ずいぶん」 could be a better fit, and if you are conveying difficulty, 「たいへん」 is often preferred. 「かなり」 has a more objective and evaluative tone, indicating a substantial level.",
