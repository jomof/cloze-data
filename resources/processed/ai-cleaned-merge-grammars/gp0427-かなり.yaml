    "writeup": "「かなり」 is an adverb used to convey a \"considerable\" amount of something. It's often translated as \"quite\", \"fairly\", \"considerably\", or \"pretty\". 「かなり」 almost always appears directly before a phrase or directly before a noun, in which case 「の」 comes between the noun and 「かなり」.\n\nHistorically, 「かなり」 came from 「可也」 and, more recently, 「可成」. Both expressions mean something similar to \"to become undeniable,\" with the former using an older kanji for \"to become\" (「也」). 「かなり」 is still used in this sense today, emphasizing that the amount or existence of something has reached a point that cannot be denied. It can carry both positive and negative connotations.",
