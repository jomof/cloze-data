formation:
  '[Noun] + を + [Movement Verb]': Indicates movement through or across a space
jlpt: N5
details:
  function: Indicates the space through which movement occurs.
  colocation: Commonly used with verbs of motion such as 歩く (to walk), 走る (to run), 飛ぶ (to fly), 泳ぐ (to
    swim), 渡る (to cross), 曲がる (to turn).
  grammatical-role: The particle を follows the noun indicating the space or path of movement.
  logical-flow: Indicates the path or area traversed during movement.
  temporal-flow: Used with verbs that describe continuous or extended movement through a space.
  spatial-flow: Clearly defines the physical area or trajectory of movement, marking the medium or surface
    of transit. It emphasizes the action's progression across or within an expanse, distinguishing it
    from static locations (で) or specific destinations (に). を conveys the dynamic interaction of a subject
    with the space traversed, making the space an integral part of the action's trajectory rather than
    just a backdrop.
etymology: The particle を originates from the verb 離る (hanaru), meaning "to separate" or "to move away
  from." Over time, its function evolved to indicate movement away from a starting point or, more broadly,
  movement through a space.
writeup: The particle を indicates movement through a space. It is used with verbs of motion to show the
  path or area traversed. Think of it as tracing the route someone or something takes, not just the destination.
  For example, 公園 {を} 通って means "passing through the park," not just going *to* the park. This particle
  highlights the trajectory or medium of movement, emphasizing the dynamic interaction between the subject
  and the space it occupies during transit. It's crucial for expressing actions like 'crossing,' 'passing
  along,' or 'running through,' as it clearly defines the expanse over which these actions unfold. を is
  particularly versatile, applicable to various scales of movement, from navigating a city street to flying
  across the sky. Understanding its role is fundamental to accurately describing spatial actions in Japanese.
false_friends:
  - term: に
    meaning: to, at (location of existence or arrival)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike を which indicates movement *through* a space, に indicates movement *to* a destination
      or a specific point *at* which an action happens. It marks the result of movement, not the path.
    grammar_point: に (static location・time)
  - term: で
    meaning: at, in, by (location where an action takes place)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike を which indicates movement *through* a space, で indicates the location *where* an action
      occurs. The action happens *at* that place, not *through* it.
    grammar_point: で (location of action)
  - term: から
    meaning: from (origin or starting point)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While を indicates the path traversed (e.g., 歩道 {を} 歩く - walk *along* the sidewalk), から indicates
      the point of origin (e.g., 家 {から} 歩く - walk *from* home).
    grammar_point: から (from)
post_false_friends_writeup: While を clearly marks the path of movement, it is essential to distinguish
  its usage from other particles like に, で, and から. For instance, when using verbs like 登る (noboru - to
  climb), を specifies the *path traversed* (e.g., 山 {を} 登る - climbing along the mountain, traversing its
  surface), whereas に specifies the *destination* or *point of arrival* (e.g., 山 {に} 登る - climbing *to*
  the mountain, reaching its summit). Similarly, で indicates the *location where an action takes place*
  (e.g., 公園 {で} 遊ぶ - playing *in* the park), not the path of movement through it. Lastly, から signifies
  the *starting point* or origin of an action (e.g., 家 {から} 出る - leave *from* home), which is distinct
  from traversing a space. Mastering these distinctions is key to precise expression.
examples:
  - english: Every day, I walk this road to go to school.
    japanese:
      - 毎日、この {道} {を} {歩い て} 学校 {に} 行き ます。
      - 毎日、この {道} {を} {歩き}、学校 {へ} 参り ます。
      - 毎日、この {道} {を} {歩い て} 学校 {に} 行く。
    english_literally: Every day, this road through, walking, to school go.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 毎日、この {道} で 学校 {に} 行き ます。
        english: Every day, I go to school walking *at* this road.
        hint: で indicates the location where an action takes place, not the path through which movement
          occurs. We're looking for how you traverse the road.
    scene: A younger student explaining their daily commute to an older teacher.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「行きます」 is polite, suitable for a younger student addressing an older teacher. 「{道}
      {を} {歩いて}」 clearly expresses the path of movement. The speaker is younger, and the listener is older,
      so the polite form is appropriate. Alternatively, 「へ」 can be used instead of 「に」 for direction with
      motion verbs, adding a slightly more formal or older tone. 「参ります」 is a humble verb used by the speaker
      to show respect to the listener. When a younger person addresses an older person, this level of
      formality and humility is generally appreciated. The example also uses 「歩き」, the masu-stem of the
      verb 歩く followed by a comma, which functions as a conjunctive to link two actions, implying sequence
      or cause and effect, which is more common in formal or written contexts.

    scene: Describing a bird's flight.
    register: semi-formal

    scene: An older parent advising their younger child about street safety.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The direct, polite request 「気 {を} {つけてください}」 is typical advice given by an older person to
      a younger one. 「{道} {を} {渡る}」 precisely indicates the action and the path. The instruction 「気 {を}
      {つけなさい}」 is also appropriate from an older speaker to a younger listener.

    scene: Describing someone quickly ascending stairs.
    register: semi-formal

          *through* or *around* the quieter area.
    scene: A woman gently suggesting to a man they move to a more private spot during a date.
    register: shitashii kuchō (intimate)
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 「{散歩} {しない}？」 is an informal, inviting suggestion. 「{静か な} {場所} {を}」 uses 「を」 to
      indicate the path or area of the walk. The overall tone is soft and inviting, and it's common for
      women to initiate intimate moments with phrases like this. The speaker is female and listener male.
post_example_writeup: These examples demonstrate the versatility of the particle を in marking the path
  or area of movement, whether literal or metaphorical. It is crucial to remember that を focuses on the
  trajectory, the space being traversed, rather than merely the static location where an action occurs
  (で), a destination (に), or an origin (から). Pay close attention to the verb used with を, as it will often
  be a verb of motion that implies movement through an expanse. This distinction is fundamental to conveying
  precise spatial relationships in Japanese.
