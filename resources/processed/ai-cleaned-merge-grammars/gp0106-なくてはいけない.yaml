    "etymology": "The grammar point 「なくてはいけない」 is derived from the negative form of a verb (ない) combined with 「てはいけない」, which means \"must not.\" The structure implies a double negative, literally \"must not not do,\" thus conveying the meaning of necessity.",
    "writeup": "「なくてはいけない」 expresses a sense of obligation or necessity. It conveys that something **must** be done. The literal translation is akin to \"must not not do,\" which emphasizes the requirement. This grammar point is versatile and can be used in both speech and writing, although it leans towards a slightly more formal register than its contracted forms. The 「は」 is sometimes dropped in casual conversation, and 「いけない」 can be replaced with 「だめ」, although 「だめ」 is more casual. For example, 「行かなくては」 is a shortened version of 「行かなくてはいけない」. The most formal version substitutes 「ならない」 for 「いけない」.",
