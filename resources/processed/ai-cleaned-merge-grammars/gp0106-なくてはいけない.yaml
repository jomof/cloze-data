    "etymology": "The grammar point 「なくてはいけない」is composed of 「ない」 (negative form of ある, 'to be' or 'to exist'), converted to its conjunctive form 「なくて」, followed by 「は」 (the topic marker), and then 「いけない」 (meaning 'cannot go,' derived from the potential negative form of 行く, 'to go'). Thus, it literally means 'must not, not do (A)', creating a double negative that expresses obligation.",
    "writeup": "「なくてはいけない」 conveys a sense of obligation or necessity, translating to 'must do' or 'have to do.' It's crucial to understand that this grammar point functions as a **double negative**. Literally, it means 'must not, not do (A),' implying that doing A is mandatory. While 「いけない」 is the most common and versatile choice for expressing \"must\" and \"must not,\" 「ならない」 is more formal and better suited for writing, and 「だめ」is a casual alternative. The 「ては」 in 「なくては」 often simplifies to 「ちゃ」 in casual speech, resulting in 「なくちゃ」. You can even omit the 「いけない」, without changing the meaning. These casual structures are very similar to words like 'gotta' in English.",
