    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「なくてはいけない」 is formed from the negative form of a verb (ない) combined with 「てはいけない」. The structure implies a double negative, literally \"must not not do,\" thus conveying the meaning of necessity. 「いけない」 itself is derived from 「行けない」 (cannot go), the potential negative form of 「行く」 (to go), gradually evolving to mean \"must not\" or \"is not allowed.\" When combined with the negative form of another verb, the double negative cancels out, resulting in an affirmative meaning of obligation.",
    "writeup": "「なくてはいけない」 expresses a strong sense of obligation or necessity, meaning something **must** be done or **has to** be done. It is formed by taking the negative form of a verb (e.g., 食べる → 食べない), changing the final 「ない」 to 「なく」 (which is the conjunctive form of an い-adjective), and then adding 「てはいけない」.\n\nWhile often translated simply as \"must do,\" its literal construction is a double negative: \"must not not do.\" This linguistic characteristic means that the action is imperative because its negation is impermissible. For example, 「食べなくてはいけない」 literally means \"it is not permissible not to eat,\" which boils down to \"you must eat.\"\n\nThis construction is common in both spoken and written Japanese. While it carries a formal tone, it is widely used in everyday conversation. For more casual situations, the 「は」 can be omitted, leading to 「なくてはいけない」 becoming 「なくちゃいけない」, or even further shortened to 「なくちゃ」 or 「なきゃ」. The final 「いけない」 can also be replaced with 「ならない」 for a more formal and slightly more emphatic expression, or with 「だめ」 for a more casual nuance.\n\n**Key Differences:**\n*   **てはいけない (must not / may not):** This structure, despite sharing 「てはいけない」, expresses prohibition. It means an action is *not allowed* (e.g., 走ってはいけない - You must not run).\n*   **なくてはいけない (must do / have to do):** This expresses obligation, meaning an action *is required* (e.g., 走らなくてはいけない - You must run).\n\nThe choice between formal and casual forms often depends on the speaker's relationship with the listener and the context of the conversation. Understanding the underlying double negative is key to grasping the core meaning and avoiding confusion.",
