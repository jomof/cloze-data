    an い-adjective. For example, 寒い (samui, cold) becomes 寒がる (samugaru, to act cold).
  な-Adjective stem + がる: Used for な-adjectives to describe someone appearing to be in a certain state.
    For example, 嫌い (kirai, dislike) becomes 嫌がる (iyagaru, to show signs of disliking).

    want to eat) becomes 食べたがる (tabetagaru, to show signs of wanting to eat).
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used to describe observable behavior that indicates someone else's feelings or state,
    as you cannot directly know what another person is thinking or feeling. It transforms adjectives and
    desires into verbs.
  function: To express an indirect observation of someone else's emotional state or desire, based on their
    external signs or behavior.
  nuance: This grammar point implies that the speaker is inferring an emotion or state from external signs,
    rather than directly stating it. It cannot be used for the speaker's own feelings or desires, as one
    would express those directly (e.g., 私は寒い desu, I am cold; 私は食べたい desu, I want to eat). It can sometimes
    carry a nuance of slight disapproval, or simply an objective observation of behavior.
  counterpoint: Direct expression of feeling (e.g., 寒い desu, 食べたい desu).
  grammatical-role: Transforms adjectives and the desiderative form into verbs that can be conjugated
    like regular godan verbs.
etymology: The suffix がる is thought to be derived from the verb がるい (garui), an old form meaning 'to be
  eager for' or 'to desire strongly'. Over time, its function broadened from expressing strong internal
  desire to indicating an outward manifestation of any internal state or feeling. This linguistic evolution
  highlights how Japanese often relies on observable behaviors to describe internal experiences, a practice
  reflected in this grammatical construction.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「〜がる」 is an auxiliary verb suffix that attaches to the stem of い-adjectives, な-adjectives, and the たい-form (desiderative form) to describe someone else's apparent feelings or desires. Since you cannot directly perceive another person's internal state, 「〜がる」 is used to convey that someone is exhibiting outward signs of an emotion, a physical state, or a desire.

  **Key Usages:**
  *   **い-adjectives:** Drop the final い and add がる. For example, 寒い (samui - cold) becomes 寒がる (samugaru - to show signs of being cold, to act cold). 悲しい (kanashii - sad) becomes 悲しがる (kanashigaru - to act sad, to appear sad).
  *   **な-adjectives:** Drop the な and add がる. For example, 嫌い (kirai - dislike) becomes 嫌がる (iyagaru - to show signs of disliking, to be reluctant).
  *   **たい-form:** Drop the い from たい and add がる. For example, 食べたい (tabetai - want to eat) becomes 食べたがる (tabetagaru - to show signs of wanting to eat).

  **Important Considerations:**
  *   **Third-person only:** 「〜がる」 is strictly used for the third person. You cannot use it to describe your own feelings (e.g., you wouldn't say 私は寒がります). For your own feelings, you would simply use the adjective or たい form (e.g., 私は寒いです, 私は食べたいです).
  *   **Inferring from external signs:** The use of 「〜がる」 emphasizes that the speaker is inferring the feeling or state based on visible actions, expressions, or words, rather than knowing it directly. This distinguishes it from other expressions that might describe a direct appearance.
  *   **Nuance:** While often neutral, 「〜がる」 can sometimes carry a slight nuance of observation or mild criticism, especially when describing someone's apparent fussiness or reluctance (e.g., 子供みたいに嫌がる - to show dislike like a child). However, it is also used in a neutral way to simply describe observed behavior.
  *   **Conjugation:** The resulting verb (e.g., 寒がる, 嫌がる, 食べたがる) conjugates like a regular Godan verb.
false_friends:
  - term: 〜げ
    meaning: Seeming; appearance; giving the impression of (often emotional or state-related)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「〜がる」 describes the *act* of showing a feeling (a verb), 「〜げ」 describes the *appearance*
      itself (often a な-adjective or adverb). For example, 悲しがる means 'to act sad' (verb), while 悲しげ means
      'sad-looking' (adjective/adverb, describing the appearance).
    grammar_point: げ (seeming・appearance)
  - term: 〜そう
    meaning: Looks like; seems like; appears to be (based on direct observation)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜そう」 generally describes a direct visual appearance or a strong likelihood, often used for
      objective observations. For example, 美味しそう (oishisou - looks delicious) is a direct observation.
      「〜がる」 is specifically about someone *exhibiting* an internal state or desire through their actions,
      which is an inference, not a direct visual property of an object.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem・Adj-stem]そうだ (it seems・looks like)'
  - term: 〜らしい
    meaning: It seems; I hear; typical of; characteristic of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜らしい」 conveys that something seems to be the case based on hearsay or reliable information,
      or that someone/something is typical of a certain characteristic. It's about an inference based
      on information or established traits, not an outward demonstration of an internal feeling like 「〜がる」.
    grammar_point: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)'
  - term: 〜っぽい
    meaning: Ish; like; characteristic of; prone to (often with a negative connotation)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜っぽい」 indicates a strong tendency or resemblance, often implying a negative or undesirable
      quality (e.g., 子供っぽい - childish, implying immaturity). It's about a persistent trait, not a temporary
      display of emotion or desire.
    grammar_point: っぽい (ish; characteristic of)
post_false_friends_writeup: 'To differentiate 「〜がる」 from similar expressions: remember that 「〜がる」 always
  refers to the *observable actions* someone takes that indicate an internal feeling or desire. You are
  describing their *behavior*, not just their appearance or what you heard. For example, if a child is
  whining and stomping their feet because they don''t want to go to school, you would say 学校に{行きたがっている}
  (gakkou ni ikitagatte iru - they are showing signs of wanting to go to school), not just that they look
  sad (悲しそう). This behavioral aspect is key to understanding 「〜がる」.'

    register: casual
    setting: professional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: 忙しがっていて (isogashigatte ite) describes him appearing busy through his actions or demeanor (e.g.,
      rushing, stressed expression), not necessarily that he explicitly said he was busy. The て-form connects
      this observation to the consequence.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, 「〜がる」 is a versatile expression for describing external
  manifestations of internal states. It is particularly useful when you are observing someone else's feelings
  or desires and need to convey that observation to others. Mastering its usage, especially the distinction
  between it and direct expressions of feelings, will significantly enhance your ability to describe social
  interactions in Japanese.
