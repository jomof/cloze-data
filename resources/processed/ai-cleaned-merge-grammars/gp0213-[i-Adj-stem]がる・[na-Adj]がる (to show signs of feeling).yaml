  jlpt: N4
  details:
    part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
    register: casual
    usage-context: general
  etymology: The grammar point 「がる」 originates from the verb 「気(き)がある (ki ga aru)」, meaning "to have a feeling"
    or "to show interest". Over time, it evolved into a suffix to express that someone other than the speaker
    exhibits certain feelings or desires. Its function is to externalize an internal state, making it observable
    behavior.
  writeup: |-
    「がる」 is a versatile verb suffix, added to adjectives or the 「たい」 form of verbs, to describe how someone *appears* to feel or what they *seem* to want. Since one cannot directly know another person's internal feelings, 「がる」 allows you to express your perception of their feelings or desires based on their observable behavior.When attached to **い-adjectives**, drop the final 「い」 and add 「がる」. For example, 「寒(さむ)い (samui)」 (cold) becomes 「寒(さむ)がる (samugaru)」 (to appear cold, to show signs of being cold). With **な-adjectives**, simply remove the 「な」 and add 「がる」. For example, 「嫌(いや)な (iya na)」 (disagreeable) becomes 「嫌(いや)がる (iyagaru)」 (to dislike, to show aversion). For **verbs**, it is typically attached to the 「たい」 form, which expresses desire. So, 「食(た)べる (taberu)」 (to eat) first becomes 「食(た)べたい (tabetai)」 (want to eat), and then 「食(た)べたがる (tabetagaru)」 (to want to eat, to appear to want to eat).

    **Important Considerations**

    「がる」 is generally used for people other than yourself (third person). If you want to talk about your own feelings, you typically use the adjective directly (e.g., 「寒い」 for "I'm cold") or the 「食べたい」 form (e.g., 「食べたい」 for "I want to eat"). Using 「がる」 for oneself is grammatically possible but often sounds unnatural, unless you are describing your own outward behavior as if observing yourself from an external perspective, or emphasizing an intense, almost uncontrollable desire. The continuous form 「～たがっている」 describes someone's current state or ongoing display of feelings/desires, while the dictionary form 「～たがる」 can describe a habitual tendency or general inclination. While 「～そうだ」 (it seems) is a similar expression indicating appearance, 「がる」 specifically emphasizes the *behavior* or *action* that leads you to believe they feel that way, focusing on the external manifestation of an internal state. 「～そうだ」, on the other hand, often implies a direct visual observation of a state or an imminent action.
  false_friends:
    - term: たい
      meaning: want to do
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「たい」 expresses your own direct desire to do something, whereas 「がる」 describes someone else's
        apparent desire or how they are showing signs of wanting something.
      grammar_point: たい (want to do)
    - term: 欲しい
      meaning: to want something
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「欲しい」 expresses your own direct desire for an object, while 「がる」 describes someone else's
        apparent desire for an object or how they are showing signs of wanting it.
      grammar_point: 欲しい (to want something)
    - term: てほしい
      meaning: I want you to
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「てほしい」 expresses your desire for someone else to perform an action for you, while 「がる」 describes
        someone else's apparent desires or actions in general, observed by the speaker.
      grammar_point: てほしい (I want you to)
    - term: そう
      meaning: looks or seems like
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「がる」 describes an action or behavior that expresses an internal state, often implying a tendency
        or a conscious effort. 「～そう」 describes an appearance based on direct observation, typically referring
        to a static state or imminent action, and doesn't necessarily imply the subject's internal feeling
        or a continuous behavioral display.
      grammar_point: そう (looks or seems like)
    - term: にみえる
      meaning: To look, to seem, to appear
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「がる」 is specifically used for expressing feelings or desires through outward behavior (e.g.,
        acting cold, wanting something). 「～に見える」 is broader, describing a general appearance or how something
        strikes one's eye, often used for physical attributes or situations, not necessarily internal states
        or desires. While sometimes interchangeable, 「がる」 is more focused on the *expression* of feeling.
      grammar_point: にみえる (to look like)
    - term: げ
      meaning: seeming・appearance
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「がる」 actively verbs an adjective to describe an observable behavior or active display of feeling.
        「げ」, on the other hand, is a suffix that forms a noun or a な-adjective, describing a general *impression*
        or *hint* of a state or emotion, without necessarily implying active behavior. For example, 「寂しげ」
        (looking lonely) versus 「寂しがる」 (to act lonely).
      grammar_point: げ (seeming・appearance)
  post_false_friends_writeup: It's important to remember that 「がる」 is used to describe your *perception*
    of someone else's feelings or desires based on observable behavior. When talking about your own feelings,
    use the standard adjectives or the 「たい」 form of verbs. Using 「がる」 for yourself is generally unnatural,
    unless you're describing how you think you appear to others.

    - english: This kid always wants new toys.
      japanese:
        - この 子 は いつ も 新しい おもちゃ を 欲し {がる}。
        - この 子 は いつ も 新しい おもちゃ を 欲し {がり} ます。
        - この 子、いつ も 新しい おもちゃ 欲し {がっ} てる。
      english_literally: This child always appears to want new toys.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - この 子 は いつ も 新しい おもちゃ が {欲しい}。
          english: This child always wants new toys (direct internal feeling).
          hint: 「がる」 describes an *observable behavior* or *outward sign* of wanting, rather than a direct
            statement of internal desire. We're looking for an expression of outward appearance.
      scene: A parent talking about their child's behavior.
      register: casual
      setting: informative
      conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: The speaker is using 「欲しがる」 to imply that the child's desire is evident through their actions,
        such as pointing at toys or constantly mentioning them. The use of 「この 子」 and the casual tone are
        typical of parent-to-parent conversations.
    - english: You must not do anything that the dog would dislike.
      japanese:
        - 犬 が 嫌 {がる} 事 を し て は いけ ない。
        - 犬 が 嫌 {がる} 事 を し て は いけ ませ ん。
        - 犬 が 嫌 {がる} 事、し ちゃ だめ だ よ。
      english_literally: You must not do things that the dog appears to dislike.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 犬 が {嫌い} な 事 を し て は いけ ない。
          english: You must not do things that the dog dislikes (dog's inherent dislike).
          hint: While 「嫌い」 describes a general dislike, 「嫌がる」 focuses on the *dog's reaction* or *behavior*
            of showing aversion, which is what the speaker is advising against. We're looking for something
            that describes the dog's visible reaction.
      scene: Someone giving advice about caring for a dog.
      register: teineigo (polite)
      setting: instructional
      conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
      nuance: The use of 「嫌がる」 emphasizes avoiding actions that cause the dog to *visibly show signs of
        discomfort or dislike*, such as pulling away or growling. It's about respecting the dog's apparent
        boundaries. The phrase 「～してはいけない」 is a common polite prohibition.
    - english: He always acts tough in front of girls, but amongst our friends he is the biggest scaredy-cat.
      japanese:
        - 彼 は いつ も 女の子 の 前 で は 強 {がる} けど 友達 の 中 で は 彼 は 一番 の 怖 がり だ。
        - あいつ、いつ も 女の子 の 前 で は 強 {がっ} てる けど、友達 の 中 で は 一番 の 怖 がり な ん だ ぜ。
        - 彼 は いつ も 女の子 の 前 で は 強 {がり} ます が、友達 の 中 で は 彼 は 一番 の 怖 がり です。
      english_literally: He always appears tough in front of girls, but among friends, he is the biggest
        scaredy-cat.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 は いつ も 女の子 の 前 で {強い} けど 友達 の 中 で は 彼 は 一番 の 怖 がり だ。
          english: He is always strong in front of girls, but among friends, he is the biggest scaredy-cat
            (inherent strength).
          hint: 「強がる」 implies *putting on an act* or *pretending* to be tough, rather than actually being
            strong. We're looking for an expression that describes someone's outward facade.
      scene: Two friends gossiping about a mutual acquaintance.
      register: casual
      setting: humorous
      conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: male
      nuance: The speaker is using 「強がる」 to highlight the contrast between the person's behavior around
        girls (acting tough) and their true personality (scaredy-cat). The casual tone and the use of 「あいつ」
        (a less formal term for 'he') indicate a close friendship. The male-specific ending particle 「ぜ」
        reinforces the casual male speech.
    - english: That person seems cold. It would be better if they wore a jacket.
      japanese:
        - あの 人、寒 {がっ} て いる。ジャケット 着れ ば いい の に。
        - あの 人、寒 {がっ} て い ます。ジャケット 着れ ば いい の に。
        - あの 人、寒 {がっ} てる。ジャケット 着れ ば いい の に。
      english_literally: That person is appearing to be cold. It would be good if they wore a jacket.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - あの 人、{寒い}。
          english: That person is cold (a direct statement of internal feeling).
          hint: 「寒がる」 describes the *outward signs* of being cold, like shivering or hugging oneself, rather
            than directly stating an internal feeling. We're looking for an expression of visible discomfort.
        - competing_japanese:
            - あの 人、{寒 そう}。
          english: That person looks cold (based on visual impression).
          hint: 「～そう」 describes a general appearance, while 「寒がっている」 implies the person is actively *displaying*
            signs of being cold through their actions or behavior. We're looking for a verb that describes
            active behavior, not just a visual impression.
        - competing_japanese:
            - あの 人、寒い {よう に 見える}。
          english: That person appears cold (to my eye).
          hint: 「～に見える」 is a broader term for 'appears' or 'looks like'. While similar, 「寒がっている」 is more
            specific to showing *feelings* through behavior. We're looking for an expression tied to exhibiting
            a feeling.
      scene: Observing someone who looks cold.
      register: casual
      setting: sympathetic
      conjugation: progressive (～ている)
      nuance: The use of 「寒がっている」 conveys that the speaker is inferring visible cues (like shivering, hunching
        over, or rubbing arms) that suggest the person is feeling cold, rather than directly knowing their
        internal state. The phrase 「いいのに」 indicates a sense of mild concern or suggestion.
    - english: My cat is jumpy.
      japanese:
        - 私 の 猫 は 怖 {がる}。
        - 私 の 猫 は 怖 {がり} ます。
        - うち の 猫、怖 {がる} ね。
        - 私 の 猫 は 怖 {がっ} て いる。
      english_literally: My cat appears to be scared.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 私 の 猫 は {怖い}。
          english: My cat is scary (causes fear) / My cat is scared (internal state).
          hint: 「怖い」 can mean 'scary' or 'scared'. 「怖がる」 specifically means to *show signs of being scared*
            or to *act scared*. We're looking for an expression of outward behavior.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 私 の 猫 は {怖 そう}。
          english: My cat looks like he's scared (based on general appearance).
          hint: 「～そう」 describes a general appearance, while 「怖がる」 implies the cat *actively exhibits* behavior
            typical of being scared. We're looking for a verb that describes a behavioral tendency.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 私 の 猫 は {怖い よう に 見える}。
          english: My cat looks like it's scared.
          hint: 「～に見える」 describes a visual appearance. 「怖がる」 specifically means the cat *acts scared* through
            its behavior. We're looking for an expression that describes active behavioral traits, not just
            a visual impression.
      scene: Describing a pet's personality; the cat tends to act scared.
      register: casual
      setting: informative
      conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
      nuance: Using 「怖がる」 describes the cat's general tendency to exhibit fearful behaviors, such as jumping
        at sudden noises or hiding. It characterizes the cat's personality through observable actions. 「うちの猫」
        is a common, affectionate way to say 'my cat' among Japanese speakers, particularly in casual conversation.
    - english: Tom seems to want this new game.
      japanese:
        - トム は この 新しい ゲーム を 欲し {がっ} て いる よ。

        - トム、この 新しい ゲーム 欲し {がっ} てる ぜ。

      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - トム は この 新しい ゲーム が {欲しい}。
          english: Tom wants this new game (direct statement of desire).
          hint: 「欲しがっている」 indicates that Tom's desire is observable through his actions or expressions (e.g.,
            frequently looking at it, talking about it). We're looking for an expression based on observation.
        - competing_japanese:
            - トム は この 新しい ゲーム が {欲し そう}。
          english: Tom looks like he wants this new game (based on general appearance).
          hint: While 「～そう」 describes a general appearance, 「欲しがっている」 focuses on the specific *behavior*
            or *active display* of wanting something. We're looking for a verb that describes the active
            exhibition of desire.
      scene: You notice your friend Tom frequently looking at a new game display with longing eyes.
      register: casual
      setting: informative
      conjugation: progressive (～ている)
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: male
      nuance: The use of 「欲しがっている」 highlights that the speaker is inferring Tom's desire based on his outward
        actions, such as how he looks at the game or talks about it. The sentence-final particle 「よ」 adds
        a sense of confirmation or informing the listener. The male speech marker 「ぜ」 in one of the examples
        adds a strong, casual, masculine tone, suggesting a close relationship between the speakers.
    - english: This is your first time on an airplane, so I think it might be scary, but don't be afraid.
      japanese:
        - 初めて の 飛行 機 な の で 怖い と 思う けど、怖 {がら} ない で ね。
        - 初めて の 飛行 機 です の で 怖い と 思い ます が、怖 {がら} ない で ください ね。
        - 初めて の 飛行 機 だ から 怖い と 思う けど、怖 {がる} な よ。
      english_literally: Since it's your first time on an airplane, I think you might be scared, but please
        don't show signs of fear.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 初めて の 飛行 機 な の で 怖い と 思う けど、{心配 し ない で} ね。
          english: Since it's your first time on an airplane, I think you might be scared, but don't worry.
          hint: 「心配しないで」 means 'don't worry'. 「怖がらないで」 specifically means 'don't act scared' or 'don't show
            signs of fear', focusing on the outward manifestation of fear. We're looking for an expression
            that addresses external behavior.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 初めて の 飛行 機 な の で 怖い と 思う けど、{怖 がら ない 方 が いい} よ。
          english: Since it's your first time on an airplane, I think you might be scared, but it's better
            not to act scared.
          hint: This is a softer suggestion. The original uses a direct command/request. We're looking for
            a more direct instruction regarding fear manifestation.
      scene: Comforting someone before their first flight.
      register: casual
      setting: supportive
      conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: The speaker is not asking the listener not to *feel* fear, but not to *show* it through their
        actions. 「怖がらないで」 implies keeping one's composure. The final particle 「ね」 softens the imperative,
        making it sound more like a gentle plea or shared understanding.
    - english: Right now, I want a dog, but since I live in an apartment, I can't get one yet.
      japanese:
        - 私 は 今、犬 を 欲し {がっ} て いる けど、マンション に 住ん で いる から まだ 飼え ない。
        - 私 は 今、犬 を 欲し {がっ} て い ます けど、マンション に 住ん で い ます から まだ 飼え ませ ん。
        - 私、今、犬 欲し {がっ} てる ん だ けど、マンション 住ん でる から まだ 飼え ない ん だ よ ね。

          english: Right now, I want a dog, but since I live in an apartment, I can't get one yet (direct
            internal feeling).
          hint: 「欲しがっている」 is used here to describe the speaker's own strong, almost overwhelming desire,
            as if it's so palpable it's an observable state, even to themselves. We're looking for an expression
            that externalizes the desire.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 私 は 今、犬 が {欲しく て 仕方 が ない} けど、マンション に 住ん で いる から まだ 飼え ない。
          english: Right now, I want a dog so badly that I can't help it, but since I live in an apartment,
            I can't get one yet.
          hint: 「～て仕方がない」 emphasizes an uncontrollable internal feeling. 「欲しがっている」 in the first person implies
            an *outward manifestation* of that desire, as if the desire itself is so strong it's an observable
            behavior. We're looking for an expression that describes a feeling that is almost externally
            expressed by its intensity.
      scene: Explaining why you can't have a pet right now.
      register: casual
      setting: melancholic
      conjugation: progressive (～ている)
      nuance: This example showcases a rare usage of 「がる」 in the first person. While typically used for
        third-person observations, here the speaker describes their own outward expression or intense desire
        for a dog, almost as if viewing themselves from an external perspective, highlighting the overwhelming
        nature of the emotion. This usage often carries a nuanced sense of self-awareness or a desire for
        empathy.
    - english: He seems to want to go on a date, but he's too shy to say it.
      japanese:
        - 彼 は デート に 行き た {がっ} て いる みたい だ けど、恥ずかしく て 言え ない らしい よ。
        - 彼 は デート に 行き た {がっ} て いる よう です が、恥ずかしく て 言え ない よう です よ。
        - あいつ デート に 行き た {がっ} てる みたい だ けど、恥ずかしく て 言え ない らしい よ。
      english_literally: He seems to be appearing to want to go on a date, but it seems he can't say it
        because he's shy.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 は デート に {行き たい} みたい だ けど、恥ずかしく て 言え ない らしい よ。
          english: He seems to want to go on a date, but it seems he can't say it because he's shy (direct
            desire, simply reported).
          hint: 「行きたがっている」 emphasizes that the desire is inferred from his *behavior* (e.g., hints, longing
            glances). We're looking for an expression that describes observable signs of wanting.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 は デート に {行き た そう} だ けど、恥ずかしく て 言え ない らしい よ。
          english: He looks like he wants to go on a date, but it seems he can't say it because he's shy
            (based on general appearance).
          hint: While 「～そう」 describes a general appearance, 「行きたがっている」 implies observing his *actions* that
            convey his desire. We're looking for a verb that focuses on expressing desire through behavior.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 彼 は デート に {行き たい よう に 見える} けど、恥ずかしく て 言え ない らしい よ。
          english: He looks like he wants to go on a date, but it seems he can't say it because he's shy.
          hint: 「～に見える」 is a broader expression for 'appears' or 'looks like'. 「行きたがっている」 emphasizes observing
            his *behavior* that conveys his desire. We're looking for an expression that focuses on outward
            behavioral display.
      scene: Two friends gossiping about a shy guy who wants to go on a date.
      register: casual
      setting: flirty
      conjugation: progressive (～ている)
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      nuance: The use of 「行きたがっている」 implies that the friends have noticed subtle cues from him that suggest
        his desire for a date, but he's too shy to verbalize it directly. The phrase 「みたいだ」 (or 「ようだ」 in
        polite form) reinforces that this is an observation or inference. The casual tone and topic are
        typical of close friends discussing relationships.

          english: The child thinks their homework is bothersome.
          hint: 「面倒がって」 indicates that the child is *acting* bothered or showing signs of being bothered
            by the homework through their behavior (e.g., hints, longing glances). We're looking for an
            expression that describes outward behavior rather than an internal thought.
      scene: A parent observes their child procrastinating on homework.
      register: casual
      setting: informative
      conjugation: te-form (～て)
      nuance: 「面倒がって」 describes the child's observable behavior of reluctance or annoyance towards their
        homework, such as fidgeting, complaining, or simply avoiding it. It’s an inference based on action,
        not a direct statement of feeling. The phrase 「なかなか～ない」 emphasizes the difficulty in getting them
        to start.
    - english: The little dog was missing its owner and whined.

          english: The puppy thought it missed its owner and whined.
          hint: 「恋しがって」 emphasizes the puppy's *observable behavior* (whining, looking sad) that indicates
            its feeling of longing, not a direct internal thought. We're looking for an expression of outward
            signs of emotion.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 子犬 は ご 主人 が {恋し そう に} 鳴い て い た。
          english: The puppy whined as if it missed its owner.
          hint: While 「～そう」 describes a general appearance, 「恋しがって」 implies the puppy is *actively displaying*
            signs of missing its owner through its actions. We're looking for a verb that describes a behavioral
            tendency.
      scene: A puppy left alone at home, missing its owner.
      register: casual
      setting: melancholic
      conjugation: progressive (～ている)
      nuance: 「恋しがって」 describes the observable behavior of the puppy (whining, looking sad) that indicates
        it misses its owner. This emphasizes the external manifestation of the internal feeling.
  post_example_writeup: As illustrated in the examples, 「がる」 is primarily used to describe the external
    manifestation of feelings or desires in a third person. However, the last example demonstrates its less
    common, but valid, use in the first person when the speaker describes their own intense feelings as
    if observing themself from an external perspective, highlighting the overwhelming nature of the emotion.
    This usage often carries a nuanced sense of self-awareness or a desire for empathy.

  pronunciation:
    katakana: タガル
    romaji: tagaru
  formation:
    '[Verb stem たい] + がる': Expresses that someone else seems to want to do something (not the speaker).
  jlpt: N4
  details:
    part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
    register: semi-formal
    usage-context: general
  etymology: The grammar point 「たがる」 is formed by combining the auxiliary verb 「たい」 (tai), which expresses
    the speaker's desire to do something, with the verb 「がる」 (garu), which indicates a feeling or behavior
    is being exhibited by someone other than the speaker. Thus, 「たがる」 essentially means "to show signs of
    wanting to do something," referring to a third person's apparent desire.
  writeup: "This grammar point, 「たがる」, is used to express that someone *appears* or *acts like* they want\
    \ to do something. It is used exclusively for third persons, not the speaker themselves. You learned\
    \ about 「がる」 already, and this is another place it appears. It is formed by attaching 「たい」 to the ます\
    \ stem of a verb and then replacing the い of 「たい」 with 「がる」. Think of it as \"wanting to want\" something.\
    \ \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「たがる」 contrasts with 「てほしい」, which means \"to want someone\
    \ to do (A).\" The nuance is different: 「たがる」 describes an observed behavior, while 「てほしい」 expresses\
    \ a direct desire."
  false_friends:
    - term: たい
      meaning: Want to do
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「たい」 expresses the speaker's own desire to do something, whereas 「たがる」 expresses someone else's
        apparent desire.
      grammar_point: たい (want to do)
    - term: がほしい
      meaning: To want something, To be in need of
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「がほしい」 expresses the desire for a *thing* (object), whereas 「たがる」 expresses the desire to
        *do* something (action), and is about observing that someone else wants to do something.
      grammar_point: ほしい (want something)
    - term: てほしい
      meaning: I want you to
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「てほしい」 expresses a direct request or wish that someone does something for the speaker, while
        「たがる」 describes an observed behavior or feeling of wanting to do something by a third party.
      grammar_point: てほしい (I want you to)
    - term: がる
      meaning: To feel, To think, To act as if, To want, To desire
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「がる」 is a suffix used to describe how a third person shows signs of feeling or appears to
        have a certain desire. While 「たがる」 is specifically for wanting to *do* a verb, 「がる」 also combines
        with i-adjectives, such as 「ほしい」 to form 「ほしがる」 (to show signs of wanting a *thing*), or 「さびしい」
        to form 「さびしがる」 (to act lonely).
      grammar_point: '[i-Adj-stem]がる・[na-Adj]がる (to show signs of feeling)'
  post_false_friends_writeup: The key to differentiating these expressions lies in understanding who is
    expressing the desire and what the object of that desire is. 「たい」 is for your own desires, 「がほしい」 is
    for wanting things, 「てほしい」 is for wanting someone to do something for you, and 「たがる」 is for describing
    another person's apparent desire to *do* something.

      setting: reflective
      conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
      nuance: The negative past form 「たがらなかった」 (tagaranakatta) indicates that his lack of desire was evident
        through his actions or expressions, leading to the decision not to pressure him. This highlights
        the observational aspect of 「たがる」.
  post_example_writeup: Note that 「たがる」 describes an external observation of someone's desire or inclination.
    It is not used for the speaker's own desires, which would be expressed with 「～たい」. When you use 「たがる」,
    you are reporting what you see or infer about another person's wishes, often through their actions or
    expressions.
