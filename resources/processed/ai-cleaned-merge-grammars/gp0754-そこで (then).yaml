        "[Sentence 1], そこで [Sentence 2]": "Connects two clauses where Sentence 1 sets a condition or moment, and Sentence 2 describes the action immediately taken in response, often with a slight pause.",
        "[Sentence 1]. そこで [Sentence 2]": "Connects two sentences where Sentence 1 states a fact or situation, and Sentence 2 introduces a subsequent action, suggestion, or logical consequence."

        "usage-context": "This grammar point is flexible and can be used in both formal and casual contexts, depending on the surrounding vocabulary and sentence structure.",
        "function": "Connects a preceding event or situation with a subsequent action, result, or decision.",
        "nuance": "Often implies a logical step or a decision made 'at that point' or 'then and there' in response to the preceding information. It can introduce a suggestion, a necessary action, or an explanation for a subsequent event.",
        "grammatical-role": "Conjunction",
        "logical-flow": "Indicates that the action or situation in the second clause (Sentence 2) is a direct consequence of the event or situation in the first clause (Sentence 1).",
        "temporal-flow": "Indicates that the action or situation in the second clause (Sentence 2) occurs immediately after the event or situation in the first clause (Sentence 1). It highlights the moment or context in which the subsequent action is taken."
    },
    "etymology": "「そこで」 is derived from 「其処」 (soko), meaning \"that place.\" Over time, it evolved to take on a conjunctive meaning, indicating a connection or consequence related to the preceding context. The term has also been borrowed into a dialectal interrogative 「ほんで」, meaning \"and so?\" Its original meaning of 'that place' indicates a pivot point, which aligns with its current conjunctive usage of indicating a subsequent action 'at that point'.",
    "writeup": "「そこで」 is a conjunction used to connect two sentences or clauses, indicating a logical or temporal relationship between them. It can be translated as \"then,\" \"therefore,\" \"and so,\" or \"at that point.\" The first part of the sentence often sets up a situation or reason, and 「そこで」 introduces the resulting action, decision, or outcome. It indicates that the second part of the sentence is a direct consequence or response to the first. 「そこで」 is commonly used to transition between events or ideas, providing a sense of logical flow. Pay attention to the context to determine the precise meaning – whether it's temporal (\"then\"), causal (\"therefore\"), or simply connective (\"and so\"). Its usage can range from casual conversation to more formal contexts, depending on the surrounding vocabulary and sentence structure.",
