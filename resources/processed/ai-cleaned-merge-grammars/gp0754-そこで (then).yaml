        "Part of Speech": "Conjunction",
        "Function": "Connects a preceding situation or reason with a subsequent action, result, or decision.",
        "Nuance": "Indicates a logical or temporal sequence between two clauses. Sentence 2 is what happens after Sentence 1, often as a direct consequence.",
        "Register": "Appropriate for both formal and casual settings, depending on the surrounding language."
    },
    "etymology": "「そこで」 is derived from 「其処」 (soko), meaning \"that place.\" Over time, it evolved to take on a conjunctive meaning, indicating a connection or consequence related to the preceding context. The term has also been borrowed into a dialectal interrogative 「ほんで」, meaning \"and so?\"",
    "writeup": "「そこで」 is a conjunction used to connect two sentences or clauses, indicating a logical or temporal relationship between them. It can be translated as \"then,\" \"therefore,\" \"and so,\" or \"at that point.\" The first part of the sentence often sets up a situation or reason, and 「そこで」 introduces the resulting action, decision, or outcome. It indicates that the second part of the sentence is a direct consequence or response to the first.",

            "nuance": "The 「ください」 form makes this a polite request suitable for an older instructor addressing a group. 「拍手」 means “applause” and 「手を挙げたら」 uses a conditional form of the verb 「挙げる」 meaning 'to raise.'",
