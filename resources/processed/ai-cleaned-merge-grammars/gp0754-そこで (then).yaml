        "[Sentence 1], そこで [Sentence 2]": "Connects two clauses where Sentence 1 sets a condition or moment, and Sentence 2 describes the action immediately taken in response, often with a slight pause.",

        "usage-context": "This grammar point is flexible and can be used in both formal and casual contexts, depending on the surrounding vocabulary and sentence structure.",
        "function": "Connects a preceding event or situation with a subsequent action, result, or decision.",
        "nuance": "Often implies a logical step or a decision made 'at that point' or 'then and there' in response to the preceding information. It can introduce a suggestion, a necessary action, or an explanation for a subsequent event.",
        "grammatical-role": "Conjunction",
        "logical-flow": "Indicates that the action or situation in the second clause (Sentence 2) is a direct consequence of the event or situation in the first clause (Sentence 1).",
        "temporal-flow": "Indicates that the action or situation in the second clause (Sentence 2) occurs immediately after the event or situation in the first clause (Sentence 1). It highlights the moment or context in which the subsequent action is taken."
    },
    "etymology": "「そこで」 is derived from 「其処」 (soko), meaning \"that place.\" Over time, it evolved to take on a conjunctive meaning, indicating a connection or consequence related to the preceding context. The term has also been borrowed into a dialectal interrogative 「ほんで」, meaning \"and so?\" Its original meaning of 'that place' indicates a pivot point, which aligns with its current conjunctive usage of indicating a subsequent action 'at that point'.",
    "writeup": "「そこで」 is a conjunction used to connect two sentences or clauses, indicating a logical or temporal relationship between them. It can be translated as \"then,\" \"therefore,\" \"and so,\" or \"at that point.\" The first part of the sentence often sets up a situation or reason, and 「そこで」 introduces the resulting action, decision, or outcome. It indicates that the second part of the sentence is a direct consequence or response to the first. 「そこで」 is commonly used to transition between events or ideas, providing a sense of logical flow. Pay attention to the context to determine the precise meaning – whether it's temporal (\"then\"), causal (\"therefore\"), or simply connective (\"and so\"). Its usage can range from casual conversation to more formal contexts, depending on the surrounding vocabulary and sentence structure.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While both connect clauses, 「そして」 primarily indicates a simple sequence or addition of information, whereas 「そこで」 implies a more direct consequence or a shift in focus to the action taken at that point, indicating a 'then and there' response to the preceding information rather than just a continuation of events."

            "nuance": "「だから」 is used to introduce a logical conclusion based on a premise, indicating a general causal relationship. 「そこで」 highlights an action or event that occurs immediately after a preceding situation as a direct, often necessary, response to that situation, focusing on the moment of action rather than broad causality."

            "nuance": "「すぐに」 emphasizes the quickness or promptness of an action. In contrast, 「そこで」 emphasizes the *point* or *context* at which an action is taken, signaling a logical or temporal transition to a new action or decision, not merely the speed of execution."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that 「そこで」 is about the *timing* or *context* of an action. Think of it as \"given the situation, *then* this happened...\" It marks a pivotal point where a decision or action logically follows. 「だから」 is used to state a logical result, like saying \"because of this, *therefore*...\" It explains the reason behind a conclusion. 「そして」 simply adds more information or continues a narrative without implying direct causation or timing, functioning as a simple sequential connector. 「すぐに」 focuses purely on the swiftness of an action, while 「そこで」 indicates the precise juncture or moment when a new action or decision arises.",
