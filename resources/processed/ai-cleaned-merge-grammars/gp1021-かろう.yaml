        "Register": "Literary/Archaic",
        "Usage": "Used to express conjecture or presumption, but is considered old-fashioned. Often used by older characters in fiction or those in positions of authority.",
        "Formation": "Attach かろう to the stem of an い-adjective (remove the い). For negative conjectures, use なかろう."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「かろう」 is derived from the archaic indeterminate form 「かろ」 of an い-adjective, combined with the auxiliary verb 「う」. This construction is reminiscent of older forms like 「よかろう」 which is the predecessor of 「いいだろう」.",
    "writeup": "「かろう」 is an archaic grammar pattern used to express conjecture or presumption, similar to 「だろう」 or 「でしょう」. However, it carries a distinct old-fashioned nuance and is predominantly found in period dramas, historical fiction, or spoken by elderly characters to emphasize their age or authority. To form this, replace the final 「い」 of an い-adjective with 「かろう」. The negative form, 「なかろう」, is also commonly used. This grammar point is rarely used in modern conversation.",
