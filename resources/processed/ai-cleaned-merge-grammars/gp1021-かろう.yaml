        "Register": "Formal, often literary or used by older speakers or in historical dramas.",
        "Usage": "Used to express a degree of certainty or supposition. It's a somewhat old-fashioned way of saying でしょう or だろう.",
        "Alternatives": "In modern conversation, でしょう or だろう are more commonly used."
    },
    "etymology": "かろう comes from the indeterminate form (かろ) of an い-adjective plus the auxiliary verb う. It is an archaic form of expressing conjecture or volition.",
    "writeup": "**かろう** is an old-fashioned grammar pattern expressing conjecture or volition, similar to でしょう or だろう. It is derived from the indeterminate form (かろ) of an い-adjective combined with the auxiliary verb う. While it has the same core meaning as でしょう or だろう, **かろう** is primarily found in dramas, anime, or used by elderly characters to convey authority or a sense of antiquity. It is formed by replacing the terminal い of an い-adjective with **かろう**. The negative form, **なかろう**, is also common and behaves similarly to an い-adjective. Its use is increasingly rare in everyday speech, typically reserved for specific character types in fictional works or formal pronouncements.",
