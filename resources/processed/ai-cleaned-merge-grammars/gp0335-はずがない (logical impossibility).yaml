details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  function: Expresses logical impossibility or strong improbability based on known facts or common sense.
  nuance: Conveys a firm conviction rather than a mere guess. Often used to refute or deny something.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a logical conclusion or strong assertion of non-existence/non-occurrence.
  logical-flow: Implies a logical contradiction between a premise and a potential outcome.
etymology: The term 「はず」 comes from the kanji 「筈」, which originally referred to the notched end of an
  arrow that is fitted to the bowstring. From this, it evolved to mean 'should' or 'expected' because
  the arrow is 'meant' to fit the string in a certain way. Therefore, 「はずがない」 essentially means something
  is 'not supposed to be' or 'cannot be' in a certain state due to a logical impossibility.
writeup: 「はずがない」 conveys that a certain outcome or situation is logically impossible or highly improbable
  given known facts or common sense. While often translated as 'hardly possible' or 'unlikely,' its nuance
  is stronger than those English terms might suggest for logical impossibility. It indicates that a particular
  state or outcome simply **cannot** be the reality. It is frequently used to express a firm logical conclusion
  based on given circumstances. It is important to distinguish 「はずがない」 from 「ないはずだ」. While both involve
  a negative expectation, 「はずがない」 asserts a **logical impossibility** or extreme improbability. For example,
  if you know someone is a vegetarian, you would say 「彼が肉を食べるはずがない」(He can't possibly eat meat). On the
  other hand, 「ないはずだ」 expresses a **strong expectation or belief that something is not true**, but it
  doesn't necessarily imply a logical impossibility. For example, 「財布を忘れたはずはない」(I shouldn't have forgotten
  my wallet) indicates the speaker believes they didn't forget it, but it's not logically impossible that
  they did.

  - term: はずだ
    meaning: Bound to (be), expected to (be), should be (able)
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「はずがない」, which asserts that something is not a logical possibility, 「はずだ」 asserts a
      high probability or expectation.
    grammar_point: はずだ (expected to be)
  - term: わけだ
    meaning: For that reason, no wonder, as you'd expect, naturally, thus, this is why
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「はずがない」, which expresses logical improbability, 「わけだ」 explains a reason or clarifies
      a situation, often leading to a natural conclusion.
    grammar_point: わけだ (logical conclusion)
  - term: ないことはない
    meaning: Is not impossible, it doesn't mean that it isn't
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「はずがない」, which states something is logically improbable, 「ないことはない」 suggests that something
      is potentially possible, though perhaps unlikely, expressing a double negative.
    grammar_point: ないことはない (not impossible)
  - term: ことはない
    meaning: There is no need to, never happens
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「はずがない」 asserts something is logically impossible, 「ことはない」 means there is no need to
      do something or that something is not likely to happen, sharing a sense of improbability in certain
      contexts.
    grammar_point: ことはない (no need to or never happens)
  - term: わけではない
    meaning: It doesn't mean that, it is not the case, it's not like
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「はずがない」 conveys something is logically improbable, 「わけではない」 is used to deny an absolute
      truth or to clarify that something is not always the case, sharing a function of negation.
    grammar_point: わけではない (not necessarily)
  - term: わけがない
    meaning: There is no way, there is no reason, it is impossible, cannot be
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「わけがない」 is a close synonym for 「はずがない」, both expressing a strong sense of impossibility or
      logical improbability. 「わけがない」 can sometimes feel slightly more emphatic or emotional in its denial.
    grammar_point: わけがない (no way)
  - term: ようがない・ようもない
    meaning: There's no way to, it's impossible to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「はずがない」 implies a logical impossibility of a state, 「ようがない」 means there is no possible
      way or means to perform an action, both conveying a sense of impossibility regarding a situation.
    grammar_point: ようがない・ようもない (no way to)
  - term: ものか
    meaning: Definitely not, absolutely not, impossible, do you really think~?
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Both 「はずがない」 and 「ものか」 express strong negation. However, 「ものか」 often carries a more emotional,
      emphatic, or rhetorical tone, expressing a firm refusal or disbelief, whereas 「はずがない」 is more about
      logical deduction.
    grammar_point: ものか (definitely not)
  - term: そうもない
    meaning: Very unlikely to, does not seem that, does not appear that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「はずがない」 states something is logically impossible, 「そうもない」 suggests something is unlikely
      based on appearance or general impression, both indicating a low probability.
    grammar_point: そうもない (very unlikely to)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「はずがない」 asserts that something is logically
  not possible or not the expected outcome based on reasoning. If you want to express a high probability
  or expectation, use 「はずだ」. If you want to explain a reason or natural consequence, use 「わけだ」. If you
  want to indicate there is no need or that something rarely happens, use 「ことはない」. If you want to clarify
  that something is not always the case, use 「わけではない」. If you want to indicate there is no possible way
  to do something, use 「ようがない」. If you want to convey a strong, emotional denial, use 「ものか」. If you want
  to say something is unlikely based on appearance or impression, use 「そうもない」. 「わけがない」 is often interchangeable
  with 「はずがない」 but can sometimes imply a more direct or common sense denial.

        english: Even if you run at full speed, you can't catch up with that bullet train.

    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male

    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The strong logical basis is provided by 「真っ暗だったから」 (because it was completely dark). The use
      of 「はずがなかった」 here reinforces the speaker's firm conviction based on the circumstances, common in
      investigative or analytical discussions.
post_example_writeup: 「はずがない」 expresses a logical conclusion that a certain outcome is not the case, or
  that it is highly improbable. It's not a mere guess, but a firm conviction based on known facts or reasoning.
  This distinguishes it from expressions that convey mere unlikelihood or a simple denial. The logical
  basis is key to its usage.
