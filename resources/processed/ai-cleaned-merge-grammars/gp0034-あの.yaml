    "writeup": "あの is classified as a pre-noun adjectival, also known as a 連体詞 (rentaishi) in Japanese. These words do not conjugate, meaning they always appear in the same form. あの is used to identify a thing that is away from both the listener and the speaker. It is usually translated as \"that\" (thing over there). As the name suggests, these words always appear before a noun, and describe that noun in some way.",
