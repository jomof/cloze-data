  usage-context: General
etymology: The grammar point 「も構わず」 combines 「も」 (a particle indicating 'also' or 'even'), 「構う」 (kamau,
  meaning 'to mind' or 'to care about'), and 「ず」 (zu, a literary auxiliary verb similar to 「ない」, indicating
  negation). Therefore, it literally means 'without minding' or 'without caring about.'
writeup: 「も構わず」 is used to express that someone does something without regard for a particular concern
  or consequence. It combines 「も」, the verb 「構う」 meaning 'to mind' or 'to care', and the literary auxiliary
  verb 「ず」, which functions similarly to 「ない」. Common translations include 'without worrying about (A),
  (B)' and 'without minding (A), (B)'.It can follow nouns directly or verbs, い-adjectives, and な-adjectives.
  After verbs and い-adjectives, 「の」 is often used, while after な-adjectives, 「な + の」 is used. Occasionally,
  「にも構わず」 can be used instead of 「も構わず」 for added emphasis, particularly after nouns or i-adjectives.
  This structure is used to show that the speaker is ignoring or not concerned about (A), and the (B)
  part highlights what is being done without considering (A). The root verb 「構う」 itself means 'to brace'
  or 'to give pause', so 「も構わず」 indicates a lack of hesitation or concern, often in the face of something
  that would typically cause hesitation or concern.
false_friends:
  - term: ～を気にせずに
    meaning: without minding/caring about
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While very similar, 「も構わず」 implies a stronger, often more active or defiant disregard, suggesting
      an intentional dismissal of something. 「気にせずに」 can be more neutral, indicating a lack of bother
      rather than an active disregard.
    grammar_point: ずに・ないで・ことなく (without doing)
  - term: ～のに
    meaning: even though
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「～のに」 indicates a surprising or unexpected outcome given a circumstance. It highlights a contrast
      but doesn't necessarily imply the subject actively disregarded the circumstance. 「も構わず」 specifically
      emphasizes the subject's disregard for something.
    grammar_point: のに (unexpected result)
  - term: ～を顧みず
    meaning: without considering
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「～を顧みず」 is quite similar in meaning but often sounds more formal or literary. 「も構わず」 can be
      used in a broader range of contexts, including more casual ones, and sometimes implies a more emotional
      or impulsive disregard.
    grammar_point: ずに・ないで・ことなく (without doing)
  - term: ～にもかかわらず
    meaning: despite
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「～にもかかわらず」 is also similar, indicating an action happens despite a certain condition. However,
      「も構わず」 specifically focuses on the lack of concern or disregard by the subject for that condition,
      while 「～にもかかわらず」 can be more objective, stating the fact of something happening regardless of a
      condition.
    grammar_point: にもかかわらず (despite)
post_false_friends_writeup: The key difference among these expressions often lies in the degree of active
  disregard. 「も構わず」 tends to imply a more deliberate or even defiant choice to ignore something, whereas
  alternatives might suggest a more passive lack of concern or simply a contrast between two facts.
examples:
  - english: Without worrying about the due date of her paper getting close, all she is doing is hanging
      out with friends.
    japanese:
      - 娘 は レポート の 提出 日 が 近づい て いる の {も 構わ ず}、友達 と 遊ん で ばかり いる。
      - 娘 は レポート の 提出 日 が 近づい て いる の {も 構わ ず}、友達 と ばかり 遊ん でる。
      - 娘 は レポート の 提出 日 が 近づい てる の {も 構わ ず}、友達 と ばかり 遊ん でる の よ。
    english_literally: Daughter, paper's submission day approaching, not minding even that, friends with
      playing only, is.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 娘 は レポート の 提出 日 を {気 に せ ず に} 友達 と 遊ん で ばかり いる。
        english: My daughter is only hanging out with friends without minding the due date of her paper
          getting close.
        hint: While 「～を気にせずに」 also expresses 'without minding,' the scene highlights a strong, almost
          defiant disregard, suggesting an intentional and active lack of concern, making it suitable
          for conveying a parent's frustration over their child's heedlessness, whereas 「気にせずに」 can imply
          a more passive state of not being bothered. We're looking for an active disregard.
    scene: A parent expressing concern about their child's lack of focus on studies.

      explanatory or complaining tone to the mother's lament.

    japanese:
      - 彼 は 遠い に {も 構わ ず}、広島 まで 休憩 なし で 運転 し 続け た。
      - 彼 は 遠い に {も 構わ ず}、広島 まで 休憩 なし で 運転 し 続け まし た。

      driving.

        english: Even though it was far, he kept driving to Hiroshima without taking a break.
        hint: 「～のに」 means 'even though' and implies a contrast or surprising fact, but not necessarily
          a conscious disregard. The scene emphasizes the subject's determination despite the challenge,
          for which 「も構わず」 is better suited as it highlights their active dismissal of the difficulty
          to achieve their goal. We're looking for an active disregard.
    scene: Describing someone's determination to reach a destination despite the challenging distance.

        english: She rescued a cat that was drowning in the lake without considering the danger.
        hint: 「～を顧みず」 means 'without considering' or 'disregarding,' and is very close in meaning. However,
          「も構わず」 often implies a more emotional or instinctive disregard, fitting a heroic, spur-of-the-moment
          act where one might not *think* to consider the danger but rather act without concern. 「顧みず」
          can sound more deliberate or formal. We're looking for an emotional or impulsive disregard.
    scene: A dramatic account of a person's courageous act.

        english: I am annoyed because Suzuki-san calls me without minding the time.
        hint: While 「～を気にせずに」 can mean 'without minding,' the scene depicts annoyance at *inconsiderate*
          behavior. 「も構わず」 captures this sense of someone acting without *any* regard for the implications
          or inconvenience to others, making the annoyance more pronounced and fitting for complaining.
          We're looking for a complete disregard for others' convenience.
    scene: Complaining to a friend about a colleague's inconsiderate behavior.

        english: Despite the doctor having told me to stop, I participated in the tournament and got seriously
          injured.
        hint: 「～にもかかわらず」 means 'despite' or 'in spite of' and is similar. However, the scene emphasizes
          the *consequences of ignoring advice*, suggesting a deliberate choice to disregard warnings.
          「も構わず」 conveys this active dismissal of the doctor's orders, implying a stronger sense of personal
          responsibility for the outcome compared to the more neutral 'despite'. We're looking for a deliberate
          and personal disregard.
    scene: Explaining the consequences of ignoring medical advice after the fact.

        english: She danced in the nude without minding other people looking.
        hint: 「～を気にせずに」 conveys 'without minding,' but the scene implies a strong, almost rebellious disregard
          for social norms. 「も構わず」 effectively highlights this deliberate and extreme lack of concern
          for others' opinions, which 「気にせずに」 might not fully capture. We're looking for a defiant disregard
          for social norms.
    scene: Describing someone's actions that disregard social norms or public opinion.

        hint: 「～のに」 means 'even though it's embarrassing' and implies a surprising action given the circumstance.
          However, the scene describes a public declaration of affection, which suggests a profound, almost
          reckless disregard for personal embarrassment. 「も構わず」 conveys this deeper level of active dismissal
          of shame, making the act more dramatic and impactful. We're looking for a profound and active
          dismissal of shame.
    scene: Describing a bold public declaration of affection.

        hint: 「～を気にせずに」 means 'without minding failure.' The scene focuses on 'dedication despite potential

          a continuous, unwavering commitment to the research without allowing setbacks to cause concern.

        english: Even though it's mealtime, they are engrossed in their work.
        hint: 「～なのに」 means 'even though there's mealtime,' suggesting a surprising situation. However,
          the scene emphasizes 'intense focus' and 'neglecting personal needs,' implying a deliberate
          and complete disregard for something usually enjoyed. 「も構わず」 highlights this strong, almost
          ascetic dismissal of personal pleasure for the sake of work. We're looking for a strong, deliberate
          disregard for personal needs.

          - 彼 は 疲れ て いる {の に}、走り 続け た。
        english: Even though he was tired, he kept running.
        hint: 「～のに」 implies a contrast or surprising outcome. While it conveys that he kept running despite
          being tired, it doesn't emphasize his active disregard for his fatigue. 「も構わず」 highlights his
          deliberate choice to ignore his tiredness. We're looking for a deliberate disregard of a physical
          state.
    scene: Describing an athlete's endurance during a challenging run.
    register: semi-formal

        english: Even though the food was spicy, he ate it all.
        hint: 「～のに」 simply states a contrast, whereas 「も構わず」 emphasizes a deliberate disregard for the
          spiciness. We're looking for the sense of actively not caring about the food's heat.
    scene: Describing someone's determination to finish a meal, perhaps to prove a point or due to extreme
      hunger.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The use of 「辛い の も 構わ ず」 with an い-adjective clearly shows the active disregard for the food's
      characteristic. 「全部 食べ て しまっ た」 conveys completion, possibly with a hint of surprise or the speaker's
      humorous observation of the person's tenacity.
post_example_writeup: 「も構わず」 can be used in various contexts to indicate a disregard for certain factors.
  The nuance often reflects the speaker's judgment or emotional response to the situation.
