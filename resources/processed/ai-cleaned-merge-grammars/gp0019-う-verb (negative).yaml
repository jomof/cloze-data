    "etymology": "The negative auxiliary ない originates from the adjective 無い (nai), meaning \"nonexistent\" or \"not to be\". Over time, it grammaticalized into an auxiliary verb used to negate verbs. The polite form ません is derived from the negative conjugation of ます (masu), the polite auxiliary verb.",
    "writeup": "To form the negative of a う-verb, you'll change the ending of the verb before adding ない (casual) or ません (polite). If using ない, change the final う sound to an あ sound in the same row (e.g., 買う (kau) becomes 買わない (kawanai)). The only exception is if the verb ends in う itself, then it changes to わ (e.g., 言う (iu) becomes 言わない (iwanai)). If using ません, change the final う sound to an い sound in the same row (e.g., 買う (kau) becomes 買いません (kaimasen)).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   ない and ません can mean \"don't\" (usually not), \"won't\" (intentionally not), or \"can't\" (unintentionally not) depending on context.\n*   ない and ません are auxiliary verbs, which means they conjugate on their own.\n*   Be careful not to confuse this ない with the ない used to make adjectives negative, as it follows different rules.",
