    "etymology": "The 「お」 or 「ご」 is an honorific prefix, and 「する」 is the plain form of the verb \"to do.\" When combined with the ます-stem of a verb, it creates a humble expression. This construction indicates that the speaker is performing an action for someone of higher status, thereby showing deference.",
    "writeup": "「お〜する」 comes from humble speech (謙譲語, *kenjōgo*), a type of polite Japanese used to describe the speaker's actions or states in a way that shows respect to the listener. It's used when the speaker's actions involve or affect someone of higher status. 「お〜する」 is similar to 「お〜になる」 but is used for humble speech rather than honorific language (尊敬語, *sonkeigo*). \n\n*   When attaching to Japanese origin verbs, use 「お」. Example: お持ちします (*omochi shimasu*, I will hold). \n*   When attaching to Sino-Japanese origin verbs, use 「ご」. Example: ご説明します (*gosetsumei shimasu*, I will explain).\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   For verbs that are already 「する」 verbs, change the prefix to 「ご」. For example, 勉強する (*benkyō suru*, to study) becomes ご勉強します (*gobenkyō shimasu*).\n*   In rare cases, 「お」 may be used instead of 「ご」 with Sino-Japanese words. These are usually common verbs like お電話します (*odenwa shimasu*, I will call). It's best to memorize these exceptions.",
