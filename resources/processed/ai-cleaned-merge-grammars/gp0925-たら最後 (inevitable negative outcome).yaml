id: gp0925
meaning: Once, Now that, As soon as
pronunciation:
  katakana: タラサイゴ
  romaji: tara saigo
formation:
  Verb-たら form + 最後: Expresses that once a certain action or event occurs, a negative or undesirable consequence
    will inevitably follow.
jlpt: N1
etymology: The structure combines the conditional/temporal particle 「たら」 with 「最後」 (saigo), meaning "end"
  or "last." Thus, 「たら最後」 literally means "if/when... then the end/last result is...", implying an irreversible
  consequence.
writeup: 「たら最後」 expresses the idea that once something happens, a negative or undesirable result is inevitable.
  It is akin to saying "once (A), then definitely (B)", where (B) is invariably a negative consequence
  expected to occur as a direct result of action (A). This structure can be translated as "once (A), (B)",
  "now that (A), (B)", or "as soon as (A), (B)". This grammatical point can also be expressed as 「たが最後」.
  Both 「たら」 and 「が」 function as conjunctions here. While 「たら」 conveys a conditional or temporal "if/when,"
  「が」 typically implies "however" or "but." Therefore, 「たが最後」 could be interpreted as "(A) happens, but
  the inevitable outcome is (B)," whereas 「たら最後」 suggests "when (A) occurs, the final result will be (B)."
  Despite these subtle etymological distinctions, these two forms are used completely interchangeable
  in modern Japanese. The term 「最後」 (saigo), meaning "end" or "last," emphasizes that the subsequent consequence
  (B) represents the irreversible "final state." Although 「最後」 often appears before the comma in these
  sentences, it is logically connected to the (B) clause, signifying that the event (A) leads to this
  ultimate, often unwelcome, conclusion. Occasionally, the (B) clause may be omitted when the negative
  outcome is self-evident or strongly implied by context.

  - term: たが最後
    meaning: Once, Now that, As soon as (with negative outcome)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「たら最後」 emphasizes the conditional or temporal aspect leading to an inevitable negative
      outcome, 「たが最後」 places a slight emphasis on the contrast or consequence, implying 'happened, but
      then the ultimate result was...'. Despite this subtle difference, they are functionally interchangeable
      in modern Japanese.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:たが最後 (once・now that・as soon as)
  - term: や否や
    meaning: As soon as
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「や否や」 indicates immediate succession of events without implying a negative or unavoidable
      outcome, focusing purely on the temporal proximity. 「たら最後」 specifically carries the nuance that
      once the first action occurs, an undesirable consequence is certain and irreversible.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-た] とたん(に)・が早いか・や否や・なり (as soon as)'
  - term: たとたんに
    meaning: The moment
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「や否や」, 「たとたんに」 expresses an immediate, often surprising, consequence following
      an action, but it does not inherently imply a negative or irreversible outcome. The focus is on
      the suddenness of the second event. 「たら最後」, in contrast, specifically highlights the certainty of
      a negative final state.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-た] とたん(に)・が早いか・や否や・なり (as soon as)'
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「たら最後」 and 「たが最後」 are interchangeable for expressing inevitable negative
  outcomes, phrases like 「や否や」 and 「たとたんに」 also denote immediate succession. However, these latter expressions
  do not carry the inherent connotation of an unavoidable, undesirable result. They simply describe what
  happens right after something else, without judgment or strong prediction of negativity.

        hint: The scene uses {たら最後} to illustrate the inevitable and uncontrollable nature of prolonged
          talking once started, conveying a sense of helplessness for the speaker. We're looking for a
          grammar point that expresses an inevitable negative outcome once an action occurs, similar to
          'once... then it's over'.

        english: Once she opens her mouth, she tends to talk endlessly, unable to control herself.
        hint: Both 「たら最後」 and 「たが最後」 are interchangeable, but 「たら最後」 emphasizes the temporal sequence

          outcome ('X happened, but then Y'). For this context, both are perfectly natural. We're looking

          nature of losing trust, unlike a simple conditional which only indicates a consequence without

    nuance: The addition of 「比喩 で は なく」 (hiyu de wa naku), meaning "not a metaphor," emphasizes the literal

post_example_writeup: This is a robust phrase for conveying strong, inevitable negative outcomes. Pay
  close attention to the nuance that the original action, even if seemingly minor, leads to a significant
  and often undesirable finality. While it commonly describes literal or severe consequences, it can also
  be used with humorous exaggeration, as seen in the examples about talkative people or captivating smiles.
