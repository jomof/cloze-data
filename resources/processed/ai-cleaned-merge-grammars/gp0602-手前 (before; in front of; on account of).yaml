jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: noun
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used in both formal and informal contexts to express various nuances depending on the
    structure.
  function: Expresses being on the verge of an action or state (verb + 手前); indicates an obligation or
    constraint due to one's position, status, or a prior action/favor (noun + の 手前); or refers to a location
    immediately in front of someone or something, often from the speaker's perspective (noun + の 手前 /
    手前 itself as a location).
  nuance: Conveys a sense of obligation, critical temporal or spatial proximity, or a specific perspective.
    When used with verbs, it implies a point of no return or a critical threshold. When used with nouns,
    it highlights the influence of one's audience or social standing, often compelling a certain behavior.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a noun, but often used adverbially to modify verbs or as part of a phrase
    indicating a condition or reason.
etymology: The word 「手前」 originally meant 'the space in front of one's hands' or 'oneself.' Over time,
  it evolved to include meanings related to one's position, perspective, or the area immediately surrounding
  oneself. The nuance of obligation or constraint arises from the idea that one's actions must be considered
  in relation to their immediate surroundings or personal standing. The spatial meaning also extends to
  'the area closer to the speaker's side'.
writeup: 'The noun 「手前」 has several meanings and nuances depending on the context in which it is used.
  It can refer to a physical location, imply being on the verge of something, or signify a sense of obligation
  or social pressure. When 「手前」 is used with a verb in its plain form (e.g., する手前), it expresses being
  "just before" or "on the verge of" an action or state. This usage often implies a critical moment or
  a point of no return, where something was narrowly avoided or an action is about to commence. It carries
  a stronger sense of immediate proximity and criticality than a simple ''before''. When combined with
  a noun (e.g., Noun の手前), 「手前」 can have two primary interpretations: 1. "In front of" or "this side of":
  It refers to a physical location that is immediately in front of someone or something, often from the
  speaker''s or observer''s perspective. This is a more precise spatial indicator than the general 「前」
  (mae), indicating something that is closer or on ''this side''. 2. "From one''s standpoint," "in consideration
  of," or "on account of": This usage implies a sense of obligation, responsibility, or social pressure.
  One''s actions are influenced or dictated by the presence, reputation, or expectations of someone else,
  or by a past action or favor. It''s often used with phrases that express unavoidable action, such as
  「わけにはいかない」 (wake ni wa ikanai - can''t do it) or 「しかない」 (shika nai - have no choice but to). This nuance
  is particularly important in Japanese culture, where maintaining appearances and fulfilling social duties
  are highly valued. Despite these varied translations, 「手前」 consistently conveys something that is ''facing''
  the noun or verb it modifies, whether it''s a physical direction, a temporal proximity, or a social
  imperative.'
false_friends:
  - term: まえに
    meaning: Before, In front of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「まえに」 also means 'before' or 'in front of,' it does not carry the same implication of
      obligation, consequence, or being 'on the brink' that 「手前」 often does. 「前に」 is a more straightforward
      spatial or temporal indicator, lacking the nuance of compulsion or a specific perspective.
    grammar_point: まえに (before・in front)
  - term: <suggest>:直前
    meaning: Just before, immediately before
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「直前」 refers to the simple immediacy before an event, lacking the nuance of being 'on the very
      brink' or 'a hair's breadth away' from something critical that 「手前」 can convey. It primarily focuses
      on time rather than the sense of social obligation or standpoint.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:直前 (just before)
  - term: <suggest>:目の前
    meaning: Right in front of one's eyes, directly in front
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「目の前」 emphasizes direct visual presence or a very immediate, tangible location. However, it
      doesn't carry the implication of one's 'standpoint' or the social pressure inherent in 「手前」 when
      used in that context. While both can refer to close proximity, 「目の前」 is purely spatial and visual.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:目の前 (right in front of one's eyes)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「手前」 shares superficial meanings with phrases like 「前に」, 「直前」, and 「目の前」,
  its unique characteristic lies in conveying a deeper sense of obligation, critical proximity, or a specific
  standpoint. 「前に」 and 「直前」 are more general temporal or spatial indicators, simply meaning 'before' or
  'immediately before', without the implication of being on the brink or the 'point of no return' that
  「手前」 can carry. Similarly, 「目の前」 denotes something physically 'in front of one's eyes', a purely visual
  and spatial relationship, whereas 「手前」, when used in a spatial sense, often implies something in the
  immediate foreground from the speaker's vantage point, and more importantly, when used to denote a standpoint,
  it expresses a compelling reason or social pressure. Always consider the nuance of obligation, social
  context, or extreme proximity when choosing 「手前」 over these alternatives.
examples:
  - english: My father grabbed my arm just before I fell off the cliff.
    japanese:
      - 崖 から 落ちる {手前} で 父親 に 腕 を 引っ張ら れ た。
      - 崖 から 落ちる {手前} で 父親 に 腕 を 引っ張ら れ まし た。
    english_literally: Just before falling off the cliff, I was pulled by my arm by my father.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 崖 から 落ちる 前 に 父親 に 腕 を 引っ張ら れ た。
        english: My father grabbed my arm before I fell off the cliff.
        hint: 「前に」 simply states a temporal order. 「手前」 emphasizes being 'on the brink' or 'a hair's breadth
          away' from a critical event, which is more appropriate for a narrow escape. We're looking for
          an expression that conveys extreme proximity to the fall.
    scene: Someone recounts a near-accident during a hike.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: The phrase 「崖から落ちる手前」 emphasizes the critical proximity to the event, meaning 'just before
      falling off the cliff.' It highlights how close the speaker was to a dangerous situation, implying
      a 'point of no return' or 'on the brink' feeling. The verb 「引っ張られた」 (was pulled) denotes the sudden
      rescue.
    etymology: The use of 「手前」 here evokes the original sense of being 'just in front of' a critical boundary,
      emphasizing the narrow escape.
  - english: Having raised my hand impulsively, I can't back down without answering.
    japanese:
      - 勢い で 手 を 上げ て しまっ た {手前}、答え ず に 手 を 下げる わけ に は いか ない。
      - 勢い で 手 を 上げ て しまい まし た {手前}、答え ず に 手 を 下げる わけ に は いき ませ ん。
    english_literally: Given that I impulsively raised my hand, there's no way I can lower my hand without
      answering.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 勢い で 手 を 上げ て しまっ た から、答え ず に 手 を 下げる わけ に は いか ない。
        english: Because I impulsively raised my hand, I can't back down without answering.
        hint: While 「から」 can express a reason, 「手前」 implies a social obligation or pressure resulting
          from a prior action or circumstance. We're looking for an expression that conveys this sense
          of being compelled due to one's own doing.
    scene: A student in class, regretting their eagerness after volunteering for a difficult question.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The phrase 「勢いで手を上げてしまった手前」 indicates that due to the prior impulsive action of raising one's
      hand, there is an unavoidable obligation to follow through with answering. This is reinforced by
      the construction 「わけにはいかない」 (wake ni wa ikanai - cannot/it's impossible to do something), which
      implies a strong sense of internal or social constraint.
    etymology: This usage of 「手前」 reflects the evolved meaning of 'from one's standpoint' or 'on account
      of one's circumstances', implying a compelling reason to act in a certain way.
  - english: Since my senior colleague always takes good care of me, I can't refuse her request.
    japanese:
      - 先輩 に は いつ も お 世話 に なっ て いる {手前}、彼女 の 頼み を 断る わけ に は いか ない。
      - 先輩 に は いつ も お 世話 に なっ て おり ます {手前}、彼女 の 頼み を お 断り する わけ に は いき ませ ん。
    english_literally: Given that my senior colleague always takes care of me, there's no way I can refuse
      her request.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先輩 に は いつ も お 世話 に なっ て いる の で、彼女 の 頼み を 断る わけ に は いか ない。
        english: Since my senior colleague always takes good care of me, I can't refuse her request.
        hint: 「ので」 expresses a reason, but 「手前」 highlights a sense of indebtedness or social obligation
          stemming from the relationship, making refusal difficult. We're looking for an expression that
          emphasizes the social pressure or constraint.
    scene: An employee explaining why they have to do a favor for a senior colleague, even if it's inconvenient.
    register: formal
    setting: persuasive
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「お世話になっている手前」 highlights a strong sense of obligation arising from receiving continuous support
      or favors from one's senior colleague. This is a classic example of 「手前」 expressing a social or
      personal constraint that compels an action, again reinforced by 「わけにはいかない」 (cannot/it's impossible
      to do something). This is a sentiment often expressed by working professionals, and in this context,
      a female speaker might particularly feel this obligation to maintain harmonious interpersonal relationships
      within her workplace.
    etymology: Similar to the previous example, this demonstrates 「手前」 conveying a sense of obligation
      stemming from one's social position or prior indebtedness.
  - english: I can't show my unathletic self in front of my daughter.
    japanese:
      - 娘 の {手前}、運動 音痴 な 姿 を 見せる わけ に は いか ない。
      - 娘 の {手前}、運動 音痴 な 姿 を 見せる わけ に は いき ませ ん。
    english_literally: In front of my daughter, there's no way I can show my unathletic self.
    competing_grammar:

          - 娘 の 前 で、運動 音痴 な 姿 を 見せる わけ に は いか ない。
        english: I can't show my unathletic self in front of my daughter.
        hint: 'While 「前で」 denotes physical location, 「手前」 implies a social context: ''in front of'' in
          a way that suggests maintaining appearances or fulfilling a role. We''re looking for an expression
          that emphasizes the need to uphold an image before someone important.'
    scene: A parent preparing for a sports day, wanting to impress their child.
    register: casual
    setting: humorous
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「娘の手前」 literally means 'in front of my daughter' but implies an obligation or sense of responsibility
      to maintain a certain image for her. The speaker feels a particular pressure to appear capable before
      her child, emphasizing that 'from her standpoint' as a mother, she must avoid appearing unathletic.
      This reflects the desire of parents, regardless of gender, to be seen as competent role models by
      their children.
    etymology: This usage combines the spatial meaning of 'in front of' with the social implication of
      'maintaining face' or fulfilling a role, reflecting the nuance of 'from one's standpoint'.
  - english: I have to be careful of what I say in front of my girlfriend's parents.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 の 両親 の {手前}、発言 に は 気 を 付け なけれ ば いけ ない。
      - 彼女 の 両親 の {手前}、発言 に は 気 を 付け なけれ ば なり ませ ん。
    english_literally: In front of her parents, I must be careful with my remarks.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 の 両親 の 目 の 前 で、発言 に は 気 を 付け なけれ ば いけ ない。
        english: I have to be careful of what I say right before my girlfriend's parents' eyes.
        hint: 「目の前で」 emphasizes direct visual proximity. 「手前」 here suggests being 'in front of' them in
          a social sense, implying a need to act appropriately due to their presence and status. We're
          looking for an expression that conveys this sense of propriety or carefulness in their presence.
    scene: A young man reflecting on his behavior while visiting his girlfriend's family for the first
      time.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: cautious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: 「彼女の両親の手前」 signifies 'in front of her parents' in the sense of 'given their presence, I must
      act appropriately.' The male speaker feels compelled to be careful with his words to make a good
      impression, demonstrating the 'social pressure' aspect of 「手前」. The phrase 「気を付けなければいけない」 (must
      be careful) expresses this strong sense of duty and caution.
    etymology: This exemplifies the 'standpoint' nuance of 「手前」, where one's actions are governed by the
      expectations or presence of others.
  - english: Please look at what's in front of you.
    japanese:
      - 君 の {手前} に ある もの を 見 て ください。
      - 君 の {手前} に ある もの を 見 て。
    english_literally: Please look at the thing that is in front of you.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 君 の 前 に ある もの を 見 て ください。
        english: Please look at what's in front of you.
        hint: While 「前に」 is a general term for 'in front of', 「手前」 specifies something on 'this side'
          or 'closer to the speaker's vantage point.' We're looking for an expression that indicates the
          object is specifically in the immediate foreground relative to the speaker or observer.
    scene: A teacher giving instructions to a student during an art class, pointing to an object directly
      on their desk.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    nuance: Here, 「手前」 refers to something physically in the immediate foreground, closer to the speaker's
      or observer's position. Unlike the more general 「前」 (mae - front) or 「目の前」 (me no mae - in front
      of one's eyes), 「手前」 specifies something that is closer or on 'this side'.
    etymology: This usage directly reflects the original spatial meaning of 'in front of one's hands'
      or 'this side'.
  - english: I was saved just before I would have died; I was on the brink.
    japanese:
      - 死ん で しまう 一 歩 {手前} で 助かっ た。
      - 死ん で しまう 一 歩 {手前} で 助かり まし た。
    english_literally: I was saved one step before dying.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 死ん で しまう 直前 で 助かっ た。
        english: I was saved immediately before I died.
        hint: 「直前」 means 'immediately before' but doesn't carry the strong nuance of 'on the very brink'
          or 'a hair's breadth away' from a critical point that 「一歩手前」 conveys. We're looking for an expression
          that emphasizes how narrowly the person avoided death.
    scene: Someone recounting a life-threatening situation, such as surviving a car accident.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「一歩手前」 literally means 'one step before' and strongly conveys the idea of being 'on the brink'
      or 'just short of' a critical state, in this case, death. It emphasizes extreme proximity to an
      event, implying a very narrow escape. This is a common idiom using 「手前」.
    etymology: This phrase illustrates the 'on the verge of' temporal/spatial proximity meaning of 「手前」,
      emphasizing how close one came to a critical point.
  - english: The person in front of me is my friend.
    japanese:
      - 私 の {手前} の 人 が、私 の 友達 です。
      - 私 の {手前} の 人 が、私 の 友達 だ。
    english_literally: The person in front of me is my friend.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の 前 の 人 が、私 の 友達 です。
        english: The person in front of me is my friend.
        hint: While 「前の人」 can mean 'the person in front of me,' 「手前」 specifies someone who is in the immediate
          foreground or on 'this side' from the speaker's perspective, emphasizing closer proximity. We're
          looking for an expression that indicates someone is very close to the speaker, on their side.
    scene: Introducing a friend standing directly in the speaker's immediate foreground at a crowded event.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    nuance: In this context, 「手前」 specifies the person who is physically in the immediate foreground,
      closer to the speaker's position or the side facing the speaker. It's more specific than simply
      「私の前」 (watashi no mae - in front of me), indicating a very close, proximate position.
    etymology: This reflects the original spatial meaning of being 'just in front of' or 'on this side'.
  - english: Please position the organ even more forward.
    japanese:
      - オルガン を もっと {手前} に 配置 し て ください。
      - オルガン を もっと {手前} に 配置 し て。
    english_literally: Please place the organ more toward the front (where I am).
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - オルガン を もっと 前 に 配置 し て ください。
        english: Please position the organ even more to the front.
        hint: 「前に」 is a general direction. 「手前」 specifically means moving something closer to the speaker's
          or observer's vantage point, or 'this side.' We're looking for an instruction to move something
          toward the person giving the instruction or the audience.
    scene: A stage manager giving instructions to crew members to move an organ closer to the audience.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: instructional
    nuance: Here, 「手前」 is used to instruct moving something closer to the speaker's or observer's vantage
      point, or 'this side.' It's a common instruction in Japanese when directing movement towards the
      person giving the instruction or towards the audience in a performance setting.
    etymology: This usage specifically refers to the spatial orientation relative to the speaker, reinforcing
      the 'this side' aspect of 「手前」.
  - english: I became able to throw a curveball that curves earlier than before.
    japanese:
      - これ まで より も {手前} で 曲がる カーブ を 投げ られる よう に なっ た。
      - これ まで より も {手前} で 曲がる カーブ を 投げ られる よう に なり まし た。
    english_literally: I became able to throw a curveball that curves more toward the front (of the plate)
      than before.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ まで より も 早く 曲がる カーブ を 投げ られる よう に なっ た。
        english: I became able to throw a curveball that curves earlier than before.
        hint: 「早く」 refers to temporal earliness in the trajectory. 「手前」 refers to a specific spatial point
          closer to the observer/batter where the ball breaks, implying a more effective pitch. We're
          looking for an expression that indicates the curve happens closer to home plate.
    scene: A baseball pitcher describing an improvement in their technique, where the ball's break point
      is closer to the batter.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: In a sports context like baseball, 「手前」 can refer to the point closer to the batter (or the
      observer's side of the plate) where the ball breaks. This is a technical spatial use, indicating
      a more effective pitch where the curve happens 'closer to home plate' rather than just 'earlier
      in its trajectory' (早く).
    etymology: This applies the spatial meaning of 'closer to oneself' or 'on this side' to the trajectory
      of a baseball pitch, indicating the break point is nearer to the batter.
post_example_writeup: As these examples demonstrate, 「手前」 is a versatile expression with nuanced meanings
  encompassing physical proximity, temporal immediacy, and social obligation. Understanding these distinctions
  is key to using it naturally and accurately in Japanese.
