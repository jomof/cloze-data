        "Register": "Standard",

    "etymology": "The word 「はず」 comes from the kanji 「筈」, which originally referred to the notched end of an arrow that fits onto the bowstring. From this literal meaning, it evolved to imply something that is supposed to fit or be in a certain way, hence its current usage to express expectation or certainty.",
    "writeup": "「はずだ」 expresses a strong expectation or conviction that something is true or will happen, based on reason or evidence. When the speaker uses 「はずだ」, they are not merely guessing, but stating a proposition based on reliable information or knowledge. It conveys a higher degree of certainty than a mere guess but doesn't imply absolute proof. Think of it as \"it's supposed to be\" or \"it's expected that\". It functions as a noun, so it's often followed by 「だ」 or 「です」. You can use 「はずだ」 after verbs, adjectives, and nouns in their plain forms to express this expectation. Despite 「はずだ」 sometimes being translated as 'should', this is only when you think that something 'should be true', and cannot be used when making suggestions or giving advice. Due to this, 'bound' is often the more accurate translation in most situations. The 「だ」 (or 「です」) in 「はずだ」 may be omitted, especially in casual speech. This usually makes 「はず」 sound a little less certain, similar to adding 「多分」 to the end of a sentence, indicating the speaker is not 100% certain about the accuracy of what they just said.",
