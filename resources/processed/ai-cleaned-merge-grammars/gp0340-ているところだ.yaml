    "etymology": "The grammar point is constructed from the verb ending 「ている」 (expressing continuous action), the noun 「ところ」 (meaning 'place,' 'situation,' or 'point in time'), and the copula 「だ」 (a plain form of 'is').",
    "writeup": "「ているところだ」 expresses that someone is in the middle of doing something **right now**. Think of it as being \"in the process of\" or \"in the middle of\" an action. It's important to note that using 「ているところだ」 implies that someone is currently engaged in an activity and might be unavailable or busy. You wouldn't use this if you suddenly switch actions; 「ていたところだった」 would be more appropriate in those cases.",
