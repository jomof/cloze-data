        "[Verb in ば-form] + ばこそ": "Emphasizes the reason or condition expressed by the verb. For instance, 読めばこそ (precisely because one reads).",
        "[い-adjective in ば-form] + ばこそ": "Emphasizes the reason or condition expressed by the い-adjective. For instance, 面白ければこそ (precisely because it's interesting).",
        "[な-adjective stem / Noun] + であればこそ": "Emphasizes the reason or condition expressed by the な-adjective or noun. For instance, 元気であればこそ (precisely because one is healthy), 先生であればこそ (precisely because one is a teacher)."

    "jlpt": "N1",
    "meaning": "precisely because; only because; to the extent that",
    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "conjunction",
        "register": "formal",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes the reason or condition stated, often highlighting it as the sole or primary cause, indicating that *only* because of X, Y happens.",
        "colocation": "Often precedes or follows a statement of strong conviction, justification, or a deeply held belief.",
        "grammatical-role": "Connects a conditional clause (reason) to a main clause (consequence/result), stressing the preceding condition as the indispensable cause.",
        "logical-flow": "Establishes a strong causal link, asserting that the consequence is an exclusive or inevitable result of the stated condition.",
        "temporal-flow": "Implies a direct and immediate causal relationship between the condition and the outcome, without significant temporal separation.",
        "spatial-flow": "Does not inherently denote spatial relationships, but can be used to emphasize a reason related to a specific location or environment, e.g., 「この場所であればこそ」 (precisely because it is this place). This is rare and contextual. This is not its primary function. So this field can be omitted here."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「ば」 indicates a conditional clause or reason, deriving from older forms. 「こそ」 is an emphatic particle that highlights the preceding word or phrase as particularly important or the sole cause. When combined, 「ばこそ」 creates a strong, emphatic reason clause.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ばこそ」 is used to intensely emphasize the reason for a certain action, state, or belief. It conveys a strong sense of \"precisely because,\" \"only because,\" or \"it is for the very reason that.\" This construction is typically employed in formal writing and speech, such as academic papers, official statements, or deeply reflective discourse, adding a significant layer of emphasis to the stated reason. It is formed by attaching 「こそ」 to the conditional ば-form of verbs or い-adjectives. For nouns and な-adjectives, it attaches to the `であれば` form. The speaker uses 「ばこそ」 when they want to assert that the preceding condition or reason is the *unique* or *most important* factor leading to the subsequent outcome. While similar to 「からこそ」, 「ばこそ」 carries a higher degree of formality and a more profound emphasis on the exclusivity of the reason. It often implies that without this specific reason, the outcome would not have occurred or would not have been achieved in the same way. Therefore, 「ばこそ」 is a powerful tool for conveying conviction and logical necessity in Japanese.",
    "examples": [
        {
            "japanese": "困難 で {あればこそ}、乗り越える 価値 が ある の です 。",
            "english": "Precisely because it's difficult, it has value in overcoming it.",
            "scene": "A motivational speaker encouraging their audience to face challenges.",
            "register": "formal",
            "setting": "inspirational",
            "nuance": "「困難であればこそ」 emphasizes that the difficulty itself is the fundamental reason for the value in overcoming it, suggesting that an easy challenge would lack this value. The formal register and inspirational setting are typical for this use. The ending 「～のです」 provides an explanation or justification.",
            "etymology": "「あればこそ」 is a formal, emphatic form of `ある` (to be/exist), here used to emphasize the inherent nature of difficulty as the root cause of its value."
        },
        {
            "japanese": "長年 の 努力 が {あればこそ}、この 成功 が ある の だ 。",
            "english": "Only because of many years of effort, this success exists.",
            "scene": "A veteran athlete giving an acceptance speech for an award, attributing success to hard work.",
            "register": "semi-formal",
            "setting": "serious",
            "nuance": "「努力があればこそ」 strongly asserts that the long years of effort were the *sole* prerequisite for the current success, implying no other factor could have led to it. The explanatory nuance of 「～のだ」 reinforces this strong causal link.",
            "etymology": "「あればこそ」 emphasizes the condition of 'having effort' as the critical element. The combination of 「努力」 (effort) and 「ある」 (to be/exist) highlights the presence and necessity of hard work."
        },
        {
            "japanese": "君 を 心から 信じて {いればこそ}、全て を 打ち明けられる の だ よ 。",
            "english": "It's precisely because I believe in you wholeheartedly that I can confide everything in you.",
            "scene": "A young woman confessing her deepest secrets to her trusted friend.",

            "speaker_gender": "female",
            "listener_gender": "female",
            "nuance": "「信じていればこそ」 highlights that her profound trust in the listener is the unique enabler for her to open up. The sentence ends with 「～のだよ」, which is a feminine-leaning casual sentence-final particle used for explanation or assertion, adding to the intimate tone.",
            "etymology": "「信じていればこそ」 uses the conditional form of `信じる` (to believe) followed by the emphatic 「こそ」. The te-form of `信じる` combined with `いる` indicates a continuous state of belief, further emphasizing its depth."

            "register": "formal",
            "setting": "informative",
            "nuance": "「リーダーであればこそ」 emphasizes the leader's pivotal role as the *only* reason the team surmounted the crisis. The ending 「～のだろう」 adds a nuance of mild speculation or rhetorical question, suggesting this is the most logical conclusion.",
            "etymology": "「リーダーであればこそ」 uses the `であれば` form of the copula `である` with a noun to state a strong reason based on one's identity or role. This construction firmly links the leader's role to the team's resilience."

            "register": "formal",
            "setting": "academic",
            "nuance": "「願えばこそ」 underscores that the primary, and perhaps only, motivation for parental strictness is their genuine desire for their children's development. This phrasing is common in educational or psychological discussions, using 「～のです」 for explanation.",
            "etymology": "「願えばこそ」 uses the conditional form of `願う` (to wish/hope) with 「こそ」 to emphasize the deep-seated desire as the fundamental cause for parental discipline."

            "japanese": "お互い に 尊敬し あって {いればこそ}、長く 続く 関係 を 築ける の です 。",

            "setting": "reflective",
            "nuance": "「尊敬しあっていればこそ」 stresses mutual respect as the indispensable foundation for a durable relationship. The use of 「～あう」 (mutually) further emphasizes the reciprocal nature of the respect, framed by 「～のです」 for explanation.",
            "etymology": "「尊敬しあっていればこそ」 combines the te-form of `尊敬する` (to respect) with `あう` (mutual action), `いる` (continuous state), and the conditional `ば` with emphatic 「こそ」. This complex conjugation highlights the ongoing, mutual nature of the respect."

            "etymology": "「高価であればこそ」 employs the `であれば` form with the な-adjective `高価` (expensive) to present the cost as the inherent reason for the high quality. This structure builds a strong justification."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「ばこそ」 and 「からこそ」 emphasize a reason, their nuance and usage contexts differ. 「ばこそ」 is reserved for more formal and often weighty statements, suggesting that the reason is unique or indispensable. 「からこそ」 is more versatile and commonly used in general speech and writing, often highlighting the speaker's strong feeling about the reason. To summarize, 「ばこそ」 stresses exclusivity and formality, whereas 「からこそ」 emphasizes the speaker's conviction or strong connection to the reason.",
