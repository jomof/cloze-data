        "Part of Speech": "Conjunction",
        "Usage": "Used to emphasize the reason or cause in the first part of the sentence, leading to a particular result or situation in the second part. Often implies that the reason is strong or significant."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ばこそ」 combines the conditional form 「ば」 with 「こそ」, which intensifies or emphasizes the preceding word or phrase. Thus, it creates a structure that strongly asserts the reason or condition.",
    "writeup": "The 「ばこそ」 grammar point is used to emphasize the reason for something, translating roughly to \"it is precisely because... that...\" or \"only because...\" It is generally used in formal speech and writing to highlight the significance of the reason being given. The pattern is [conditional form] + 「ばこそ」. For nouns and na-adjectives, use the 「であればこそ」 form.\n\nIt strongly emphasizes the reason or cause, often implying that without that reason, the result would not occur. 「ばこそ」 is similar to 「からこそ」, but 「ばこそ」 is considered more formal and emphatic. It's crucial to use the correct conditional form (「～ば」 form) of the verb or adjective when constructing sentences with 「ばこそ」. For nouns and *na*-adjectives, use the 「であればこそ」 form.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n*   Register: Primarily used in formal settings.",
