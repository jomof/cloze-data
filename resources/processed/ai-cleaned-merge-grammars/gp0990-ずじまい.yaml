    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ずじまい」 combines 「ず」 (the classical negative auxiliary verb) with the conjunctive form 「じまい」 of the verb 「しまう」 (to finish, to end up). The 「ず」 negates the action of 「しまう」, indicating that something ended up *not* being completed or done.",
    "writeup": "「ずじまい」 combines the literary negative form 「ず」 with the voiced conjunctive form 「じまい」 of 「しまう」, meaning \"to finish\" or \"to bring to a close\". It expresses regret that something didn't happen, despite one's wishes or intentions. It is commonly followed by 「だった」 or 「でした」. Note that 「する」 becomes 「せず」.",

                    "mitigation": "While 「～ないまま」 suggests an action not taking place, 「ずじまい」 carries a stronger sense of regret and finality regarding the non-completion of the intended use, implying it was \"finished\" in an unused state. The scene emphasizes this regret."

                    "competing_grammar": "マウンテンバイクを買ったが、使えなかった。",
                    "mitigation": "「使えなかった」 simply states inability. 「ずじまい」 emphasizes that despite owning it, the opportunity to use it passed, leading to its sale without ever fulfilling its purpose."
