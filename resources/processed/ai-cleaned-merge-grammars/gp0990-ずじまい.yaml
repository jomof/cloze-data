    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ずじまい」combines 「ず」, the classical negative auxiliary verb (modern equivalent 「ない」), with 「じまい」, the voiced conjunctive form of the verb 「しまう」 (to finish, to bring to a close).",
    "writeup": "「ずじまい」 is a grammar structure that combines the literary form of the classical auxiliary verb 「ぬ」, 「ず」 'not', and the voiced conjunctive form of the う-Verb 「しまう」 'to finish', or 'to bring to a close', 「じまい」. Like 「しまう」, 「ずじまい」 will often indicate regret at something ending up a certain way. However, this regret is about '(A) not happening', due to the negation provided by 「ず」. This structure will be used following the indeterminate form of verbs. Common translations include 'to end up not (A)', and 'to not have done (A) in the end'. 「ずじまい」 will often be followed by 「だった」 or 「でした」, indicating that (A) was not something that turned out happening, despite the wishes or intentions of the doer.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   As is always the case with 「ず」, 「する」 will be altered to 「せず」.",
