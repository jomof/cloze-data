    "meaning": "Ended up not, Did not (in the end), Never did",

        "usage-context": "Used when an action was intended or planned but ultimately did not occur, resulting in a sense of regret or unfulfillment.",

        "nuance": "Carries a nuance of regret, unfulfillment, or a missed opportunity, unlike simple negation."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ずじまい」 combines 「ず」 (the classical negative auxiliary verb) with the conjunctive form 「じまい」 of the verb 「しまう」 (to finish, to end up). The 「ず」 negates the action of 「しまう」, indicating that something ended up not being completed or done.",
    "writeup": "「ずじまい」 combines the classical auxiliary verb 「ず」 (negative 'not') with the voiced conjunctive form of the verb 「しまう」, specifically 「じまい」, which means 'to finish' or 'to bring to a close'. This structure indicates that an action or event ultimately did not occur, often carrying a nuance of regret or unfulfillment regarding that non-completion. It suggests that despite intentions or opportunities, the situation concluded without the intended action taking place.\n\nThis grammar pattern follows the **indeterminate form (未然形)** of verbs. For example, for the verb 「する」 (to do), it becomes 「せずじまい」, not 「しずじまい」.\n\n「ずじまい」 is frequently used in the past tense, often followed by 「だった」 or 「でした」, to emphasize that the state of non-completion has become a finalized outcome. This indicates that a desired or expected action did not happen, contrary to one's wishes or plans, leading to a sense of unfulfilled expectation or a missed opportunity.",
