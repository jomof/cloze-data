jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: General
  function: Expresses an action that was on the verge of occurring but did not materialize or was interrupted.
  nuance: Often implies a narrow miss, a near-disaster, or a missed opportunity. Can convey relief (if
    a bad outcome was avoided) or regret (if a good outcome was missed).
  grammatical-role: Functions as a predicate to describe a state of being on the verge of an action.
  temporal-flow: Describes an action that was immediately impending but then halted or prevented. The
    past tense of the copula 「だった」 explicitly places this 'verge' state in the past, meaning the action
    itself did not come to full fruition or completion at that time. Contrast with 「ところだ」, which describes
    something presently impending, ongoing, or just completed.
etymology: 「ところ」 is a noun meaning "place" or "situation." In this grammar point, it refers to the situation
  immediately preceding an event. 「だった」 is the past form of the copula 「だ」, indicating that the event
  nearly occurred but ultimately did not. The nuance of 'almost' or 'narrowly missed' is derived from
  the inherent nature of being at a critical 'point' immediately before an event, and the subsequent past
  tense indicating that this critical point has passed without the event fully realizing itself.
writeup: |-
  「ところだった」 is a versatile grammatical expression indicating that an action or event was on the verge of happening but ultimately did not occur, or was interrupted. It conveys a strong sense of a 'near miss' or an 'almost' situation. The phrase is typically appended to the dictionary form of a verb (Vる).

  This pattern emphasizes that the speaker (or subject) was at the precise 'point' or 'juncture' (ところ) of performing an action, and then something intervened. The resulting implication can vary:

  *   **Relief**: When a negative outcome was narrowly avoided. For instance, if you almost had an accident but managed to prevent it. In such cases, adverbs like 「危うく」 (ayauku・barely・narrowly・almost) are often used to emphasize the close call.
  *   **Regret or Disappointment**: When a desired outcome was just about to materialize but was thwarted. For example, if you were just about to receive good news, but something prevented it. When this regret is strong, it is common to see 「のに」 (noni) appended after 「ところだった」, expressing 'even though I was just about to do X, Y happened (which is regrettable or contrary to expectation)'.

  While 「ところだった」 itself is a plain form, its usage is common across various registers, from casual conversation to more formal settings, depending on the surrounding sentence structure and politeness markers (e.g., adding 「です」).
false_friends:
  - term: はずだった
    meaning: Was supposed to, was expected to
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike 「ところだった」, 「はずだった」 describes something that was planned or expected to happen but didn't,
      often due to external circumstances or a change in plans, not necessarily a near miss. 「ところだった」
      specifically denotes a close call or narrow escape from an undesirable event, emphasizing the 'almost'
      nature of an action that didn't materialize.
    grammar_point: '[Clause]はずだ・はずがない (is expected to be・cannot be)'
  - term: そうになる
    meaning: To be on the verge of, to look like one is about to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both 「ところだった」 and 「そうになる」 can express a near miss, 「そうになる」 often focuses more on the
      *feeling* or *appearance* of being about to do something, or a tendency. 「ところだった」 more strongly
      emphasizes the *actual near occurrence* and its non-realization or avoidance. For instance, 「倒れそうになった」
      might mean 'I felt like I was about to collapse' or 'I almost collapsed (and then recovered)', whereas
      「倒れるところだった」 means 'I almost collapsed (but didn't)'.
    grammar_point: そうになる (almost・on the verge of)
  - term: ところだ
    meaning: About to do something; in the process of doing something; just finished doing something (depending
      on preceding verb form)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「ところだった」 which describes an action that was *about to happen but was interrupted or
      did not materialize*, 「ところだ」 indicates an an action that is *currently about to happen*, *in the
      process of happening*, or has *just happened*. The key difference is that with 「ところだ」, the action
      is either impending, ongoing, or completed, whereas with 「ところだった」, the action did *not* complete.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[た]ところだ (just finished doing)
  - term: 〜ようとする
    meaning: to try to do; to be about to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「ところだった」 emphasizes being on the *verge* of an action, often with an external interruption
      preventing it, 「～ようとする」 focuses on the *attempt* or *intention* itself, which may or may not be
      successful. 「ところだった」 often implies an external factor, whereas 「～ようとする」 is more about the subject's
      will or effort.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-volitional]とする・としない (to try to・to not try to)'
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「ところだった」 specifically highlights a near
  miss, something that was on the verge of happening but ultimately did not, often with a sense of relief
  or regret for the averted outcome. 「はずだった」 deals with unfulfilled expectations or plans. 「そうになる」 expresses
  a more general feeling of being about to do something or a tendency, and while it can overlap, 「ところだった」
  often carries a stronger sense of a direct, averted event. While 「ところだった」 vividly captures the essence
  of a narrow escape or a missed opportunity—an action that was on the brink of happening but didn't—it
  is crucial to distinguish it from similar expressions. 「ところだ」 describes something currently impending
  or just completed, directly contrasting the unfulfilled nature of 「ところだった」. Similarly, 「～ようとする」 indicates
  an an attempt or intention, focusing on the actor's will, whereas 「ところだった」 emphasizes the external circumstances
  that prevented completion. Lastly, 「～そうになる」 highlights the appearance or likelihood of an action being
  carried out, often used for physically observable near-misses, while 「ところだった」 can apply more broadly
  to situations and mental states of being on the verge. Careful attention to these nuances is key to
  conveying your exact meaning.

        hint: The scene emphasizes catching oneself just in time, highlighting the action being on the

        hint: The scene is about a definite averted negative outcome, emphasizing the relief. 「そうでした」

          looking for an expression that conveys a near-miss and subsequent relief.

    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)

        hint: The scene portrays an extreme, immediate danger that was barely escaped. 「そうになった」 is more

          an actual near-occurrence of a dangerous event.
    scene: A hiker tells a dramatic story of a close call on a mountain trail to a fellow hiker.
    register: casual
    setting: serious

        english: It seemed like I wouldn't make the deadline, but I managed to make it somehow.
        hint: This emphasizes an action that *almost didn't happen* but eventually did. 「そうになった」 conveys

          narrowly avoiding a negative outcome.
    scene: A student telling a classmate about barely finishing a project before the deadline.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The combination of 「間に合わ ない {ところだった}」 (almost didn't make it) and 「なんとか 間に合っ た よ」 (managed
      to make it somehow) emphasizes the narrow success after a moment of intense pressure, typical for
      a younger speaker recounting to a friend. The particle 「よ」 adds a sense of sharing information.

        english: I felt like I was about to decline saying I wasn't interested, but it turned out to be
          fun when I participated.
        hint: The scene describes a decision point where an action was on the very brink of occurring
          before a change of heart. 「そうになった」 might imply a general inclination or thought, not necessarily
          a concrete near-action. We're looking for an expression that signifies an action was nearly
          taken but ultimately wasn't.
    scene: Someone reflecting on a decision they almost made not to attend an event or gathering, and
      how it turned out well.

    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「興味 ない と 断る {ところだった}」 shows the speaker's initial reluctance and the nearly missed
      opportunity. The contrast with 「楽しかっ た」 (it was fun) highlights a positive surprise from overcoming
      that initial hesitation, often a conversational point when reflecting on past choices.

          the client.

          near-miss in a professional context, implying a concrete averted outcome.

        english: It seemed like I was going to not know the truth. I'm glad you told me.
        hint: The scene emphasizes a narrow escape from ignorance, implying direct intervention. 「そうになった」
          indicates a progression towards not knowing. We're looking for an expression that conveys a
          concrete near-miss of not knowing something important.
    scene: A friend expressing gratitude to another friend for revealing important information that they
      almost missed.

        english: It seemed like I wouldn't be chosen as the team leader. I was surprised to hear that.
        hint: This sentence conveys surprise at a past situation where a negative outcome was barely avoided.
          「そうになった」 suggests a likelihood of not being chosen. We're looking for an expression that signifies
          a concrete situation was on the verge of not happening, but was averted.
    scene: Someone reacting to unexpected news about a past selection process, having been told they nearly
      weren't chosen.
    register: casual
    setting: excited
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The passive negative form 「選ば れ ない {ところだった}」 (almost wasn't chosen) indicates the speaker's
      surprise at the narrow escape from not being selected, highlighting the unexpected outcome of a
      decision process. The use of 「驚い た よ」 (I was surprised!) adds to the informal, exclamatory tone.
post_example_writeup: Remember that 「ところだった」 always implies that the action *didn't* actually happen.
  It's crucial to understand the context to differentiate between situations where something was truly
  avoided versus situations where it is currently ongoing or completed. As you can see from the examples,
  「ところだった」 is a powerful expression for conveying 'almost' situations. It covers a wide range of emotions,
  from relief to regret, and can be used in various registers. Pay close attention to the context and
  surrounding adverbs or particles like 「危うく」 or 「のに」, as they often enhance the nuance of the 'near miss'
  or 'missed opportunity' that 「ところだった」 implies.
