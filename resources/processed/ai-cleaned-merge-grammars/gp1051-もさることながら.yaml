        "[Noun Phrase] + もさることながら": "Indicates that while the first noun phrase is important, what follows is even more so."

        "source": "bunpro, dojg"
    },
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「もさることながら」 breaks down as follows: 「も」 is an adverbial particle indicating \"also.\" 「さる」 is from the verb 「去る(さる)」, meaning \"to leave\" or \"to go away,\" but in this context, it implies \"special\" or \"remarkable.\" It's related to the pre-noun adjectival usage of 「さる」 as in 「さる筋」 (a certain source). 「こと」 is a noun meaning \"thing\" or \"matter.\" 「ながら」 is a conjunction particle meaning \"while\" or \"although,\" indicating a contrast or addition. Therefore, the phrase suggests that \"while the mentioned thing is also noteworthy, what follows is even more so.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「もさることながら」 is used to express that while one thing is certainly true or important, another thing is even more so. Think of it as \"It is a fact that A is important, but B is even more important.\" It's a formal expression, often found in writing or formal speech. 「も」 indicates \"also.\" 「さる」 means \"certain\" or \"particular.\" 「こと」 means \"thing\" or \"matter.\" 「ながら」 means \"while\" or \"although.\" So, literally, it's like saying \"while that thing is also something special…\", implying that what follows is even more noteworthy. To emphasize (B) further, adverbs like 「さらに」 (additionally) or 「なにより」 (more than anything) are sometimes used.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「〜というのは事実だ」 and 「もさることながら」 both acknowledge a certain fact, 「もさることながら」 goes further by introducing another, more significant point. Use 「〜というのは事実だ」 when you want to simply state something as true. Use 「もさることながら」 when you want to acknowledge something but shift the focus to a more important aspect. Similarly, 「〜だけでなく」 and 「〜はもちろん」 indicate inclusion or obviousness, respectively. However, they do not carry the specific nuance of emphasizing the *second* element as superior or more impactful than the first, which is central to 「もさることながら」. The core distinction lies in the explicit emphasis of the latter point as being more significant or surprising than the former, a nuance not present in the other similar expressions.",
