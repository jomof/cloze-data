    "etymology": "The expression 「もさることながら」 combines 「も」 (also), 「さる」 (a certain, particular), 「こと」 (thing, matter), and 「ながら」 (while, although). Literally, it means 「while that thing is also something special」, implying that something else is even more noteworthy.",
    "writeup": "「もさることながら」 is a Japanese construction often translated as \"it goes without saying that (A), but (B)\" or \"not only (A), but (B) too.\" It combines the adverbial particle 「も」, the pre-noun adjectival 「さる」 ('particular' or 'certain'), the noun 「事」 ('thing'), and the conjunction particle 「ながら」 ('while'). A more literal translation is \"while (A) is also of particular merit, (B).\" Remember that 「もさることながら」 always presents (A) as important, but (B) as even more so. It attaches to the end of nouns and noun phrases.\n\nAs (B) is emphasized, you'll often see other expressions of emphasis combined with 「もさることながら」, such as 「さらに」 ('additionally'), 「なにより」 ('more than anything'), and 「以上」 ('above that'). This phrase is primarily used in formal writing and speech.",
