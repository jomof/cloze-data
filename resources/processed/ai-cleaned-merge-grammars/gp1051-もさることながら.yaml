    "writeup": "The grammar point 「もさることながら」 is used to express that while one thing is certainly true or important, another thing is even more so. Think of it as \"It is a fact that A is important, but B is even more important.\" It's a formal expression, often found in writing or formal speech.\n\n*   「も」 indicates \"also.\"\n*   「さる」 means \"certain\" or \"particular.\"\n*   「こと」 means \"thing\" or \"matter.\"\n*   「ながら」 means \"while\" or \"although.\"\n\nSo, literally, it's like saying \"while that thing is also something special…\", implying that what follows is even more noteworthy. To emphasize (B) further, adverbs like 「さらに」 (additionally) or 「なにより」 (more than anything) are sometimes used.",
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「もさることながら」 breaks down as follows:\n\n*   「も」: Adverbial particle indicating \"also.\"\n*   「さる」: From the verb 「去る(さる)」, meaning \"to leave\" or \"to go away,\" but in this context, it implies \"special\" or \"remarkable.\" It's related to the pre-noun adjectival usage of 「さる」 as in 「さる筋」 (a certain source).\n*   「こと」: Noun meaning \"thing\" or \"matter.\"\n*   「ながら」: Conjunction particle meaning \"while\" or \"although,\" indicating a contrast or addition.\n\nTherefore, the phrase suggests that \"while the mentioned thing is also noteworthy, what follows is even more so.\"",
