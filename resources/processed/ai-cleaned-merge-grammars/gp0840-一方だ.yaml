    "etymology": "「一方」 literally means \"one direction\". The grammar point implies that something is moving in a single, consistent direction, whether it's increasing, decreasing, improving, or worsening.",
    "writeup": "「一方だ」 is used to express that something is continuously changing in **one direction**. It conveys the meaning of \"more and more,\" \"continuing to,\" or \"getting -er and -er.\" This grammar point is often used in formal speech or writing, suitable for discussing trends, societal issues, or other phenomena that exhibit a consistent, sustained change. It is typically attached to verbs that express some kind of **change**, such as 「増える」 (increase), 「下がる」 (decrease), or verbs ending in 「…なる」, 「…てくる」, or 「…ていく」.\n\nWhen used as 「Verb (dictionary form) + **一方だ**」, it functions as a predicate, stating that the subject is in a continuous, one-sided state of change. For instance, 「悪化する一方だ」 means \"it is continuously worsening.\" \n\nWhen used as 「Verb (dictionary form) + **一方で**」, it functions adverbially, connecting to a subsequent clause. This form implies \"while continuously changing\" or \"as a result of continuously changing,\" often leading to a consequence or further explanation. For example, 「残業が増える一方で、休みが取れない」 means \"As overtime keeps increasing, I can't take a day off.\"\n\nIt is crucial to remember that 「一方だ」 describes the *direction* of change, not the change itself. Therefore, it must be paired with verbs that inherently describe a process of change. The change can be positive, negative, or neutral, as long as it proceeds consistently in one direction. Negative conjugations like 「一方ではない」 are grammatically possible but very rare in practical usage because the core meaning emphasizes an undeniable, unidirectional trend, which is seldom directly negated in this structure.",
