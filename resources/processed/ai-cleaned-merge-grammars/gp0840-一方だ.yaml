    "etymology": "The term 「一方」 literally means \"one direction.\" This suggests a continuous movement or trend in a single, unwavering direction. It combines with 「だ」 to assert this continuous state or change.",
    "writeup": "「一方だ」 is used to describe situations that are continuously changing in one direction. It conveys a sense of ongoing progression, either increasing or decreasing, intensifying or weakening. It is often used in formal contexts. As the literal meaning of 「一方」 is \"single direction,\" it must be used with verbs that themselves indicate change; it cannot create the sense of change on its own. It is important to note that 一方だ itself doesn't express change; it emphasizes the continuous *direction* of that change.",
