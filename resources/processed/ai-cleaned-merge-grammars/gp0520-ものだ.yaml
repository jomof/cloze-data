    "etymology": "「物 (mono)」originally means \"thing\" or \"object.\" In this grammar, it acts as a nominalizer, turning a verb or adjective into a noun-like phrase. Adding 「だ (da)」 asserts a state or condition, resulting in an expression that describes inherent qualities, general truths, or expected behaviors.",
    "writeup": "「ものだ」 is used to express general truths, expectations, or inherent qualities. It conveys that something is natural, typical, or \"the way things are.\" It is often used to describe common sense, customs, or predictable outcomes. This grammatical structure is versatile and can be applied to various situations to highlight the expected nature of things.\n\n**Key Uses:**\n\n*   **Expressing General Truths:** Used to state facts or widely accepted ideas. For example, 「子供は元気なものだ」(Children are supposed to be energetic).\n*   **Indicating Expectations:** Describes what is typically expected in a given situation. For example, 「仕事は一生懸命にするものだ」(One should work hard at their job).\n*   **Describing Inherent Qualities:** Highlights the natural characteristics of something. For example, 「ケーキは甘い物だ」(Cake is supposed to be sweet).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「もの」 (物) is a 形式名詞 (keishikimeishi), or dummy noun, functioning similarly to \"thing\" in English, but used here to nominalize the preceding phrase.\n*   「ものだ」 can be softened to 「もんだ」 in casual spoken Japanese.\n*   The negative form 「ものではない」 or 「もんじゃない」 is used to express that something *should not* be or is *not supposed to be* a certain way. For example, 「食べ物を無駄にするもんじゃないよ！」(You shouldn't waste food!).",
