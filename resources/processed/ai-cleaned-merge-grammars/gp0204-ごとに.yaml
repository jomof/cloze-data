    "etymology": "「ごとに」 is a combination of the noun 「ごと」 (meaning 'each' or 'every') and the particle 「に」. This combination creates an adverbial phrase indicating frequency or intervals.",
    "writeup": "「ごとに」 indicates that something happens \"each time\" or \"at intervals of\" a specified noun or action. It's similar to saying \"for every\" or \"with every.\" While it can follow verbs (usually in the non-past form), it's most commonly used with nouns or phrases ending in nouns.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「ごとに」 focuses on *every instance* of something. A common point of confusion is with 「おきに」, which also means \"every,\" but emphasizes intervals or gaps *between* occurrences. Therefore, 「一週間ごとに」 means \"every week,\" while 「一週間おきに」 means \"every other week.\"\n*   「ごと」 is the *kun'yomi* (Japanese reading) of the kanji 「毎」, meaning 'every'.\n",
