    "etymology": "ごとに is a combination of the noun ごと (事), meaning 'thing' or 'matter,' and the particle に, indicating 'at' or 'in'. This combination creates an adverbial phrase meaning 'at each thing' or 'in every instance'. The kanji 毎 (mai) also means 'every' and is the kun'yomi (Japanese reading) of the kanji ごと.",
    "writeup": "ごとに expresses that something happens \"every (A)\" or \"at intervals of (A).\" It is used adverbially after nouns or verbs (usually in the dictionary form). While it can follow verbs, it's more commonly used with nouns or phrases ending with nouns.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   ごと is the *kun'yomi* (Japanese reading) of the kanji 毎, meaning 'every'.\n*   Pay attention to the difference between ごとに and おきに, which also means 'every' but emphasizes the interval or gap. おきに focuses on the space *between* each occurrence, so they aren't always interchangeable. For instance, 「一週間ごとに」 means 'every week,' while 「一週間おきに」 means 'every other week'.\n*   Some native speakers (especially younger generations) may use ごとに and おきに interchangeably, though this is technically incorrect.",
