    "etymology": "The 「て」 form is a conjugation of the verb that connects it to what follows, indicating a sequence of actions or states.",
    "writeup": "The 「て」 form of a verb, followed by another verb phrase, is often translated as \"and then\" or \"and\". This is how Japanese lists sequences of events that happen one after another. This grammar construction is used for listing things that happen in order, for example, \"I did (A), then (B), then (C)\". Other grammar structures will need to be used if you would like to talk about things that happen/happened in no particular order. For example 「たり〜たりする」, which will appear in a sentence like \"I did things like (C), and (A), oh, and (B)!\"",
