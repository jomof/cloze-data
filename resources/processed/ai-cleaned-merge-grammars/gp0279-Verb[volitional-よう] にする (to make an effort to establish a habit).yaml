pronunciation:
  katakana: ドウシ[イシケイ]＋ニスル・クスル
  romaji: dōshi[ishi kei] + ni suru, ku suru
  pronunciation_warning: The 'ishi kei' refers to the volitional form of the verb. The 'くする' part of the
    grammar point's name is generally used with i-adjectives to make them adverbs (e.g., '大きくする'), and
    does not typically apply to the volitional form of verbs in this context of habitual effort or decision.
formation:
  Verb[volitional-よう] + にする: Indicates a conscious decision or effort to make an action a regular habit
    or routine.
  i-Adjective[stem] + くする: Transforms an i-adjective into a verb phrase meaning 'to make it [i-adjective]'.
    This is not directly related to the volitional verb form's usage with にする, but is included as it is
    part of the grammar point's common naming convention. For example, 寒くする (samuku suru) means 'to make
    it cold'.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: General
  function: Expresses intention, conscious effort, or decision to make something a habit.
  nuance: Implies a higher degree of control and commitment compared to similar expressions. Focuses on
    the act of establishing a routine.
  grammatical-role: Sentence-final auxiliary verb phrase
etymology: 「する」 generally means "to do". When attached to the volitional form of a verb (e.g., 「食べよう」),
  it indicates the act of "doing" that action or state intentionally or repeatedly. The 「に」 particle here
  implies a target state or outcome of the action.
writeup: The grammar point 「Verb[volitional-よう]+にする」 expresses the idea of consciously deciding to do
  something regularly, or making a consistent effort to incorporate an action into one's routine. It conveys
  a strong sense of intention and commitment to establishing a new habit or behavior. For example, 「毎日、運動しよう
  に する」 (to make an effort to exercise every day) implies a sustained effort over time, not just a one-off
  attempt. This distinguishes it from 「Verb[volitional-よう]+とする」, which often indicates an immediate attempt
  or being on the verge of an action. The phrase 「～くする」, while part of the grammar point's listed name,
  is fundamentally different. It is used with *i*-adjectives to turn them into adverbs, signifying making
  something *more* of that adjective (e.g., 「大きくする」 - to make bigger). It does not apply to the volitional
  form of verbs in this context of habitual effort.
false_friends:
  - term: ～ようになる
    meaning: to become able to; to start to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「Verb[volitional-よう]+にする」, 「～ようになる」 describes a change in ability or the beginning
      of a new state, focusing on the result rather than the deliberate effort.
    grammar_point: ようになる (to come to be)
  - term: ～ことにする
    meaning: to decide on (something); to make it a rule (to do)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While both involve decision, 「Verb[volitional-よう]+にする」 describes the ongoing effort to *establish*
      a habit, whereas 「～ことにする」 refers to a specific decision made at a point in time, often establishing
      a rule or course of action.
    grammar_point: ことにする (to decide to)
  - term: Verb[volitional-よう]+とする
    meaning: to try to; to be about to do; to decide temporarily
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike 「Verb[volitional-よう]+にする」 which implies a commitment to regular action or habit, 「Verb[volitional-よう]+とする」
      describes an immediate or temporary attempt, or being on the verge of an action.
    grammar_point: Verb[volitional]+とする (try about to)
  - term: Verb[volitional-よう]+思う
    meaning: I think I will; I intend to
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Verb[volitional-よう]+思う expresses a personal thought or intention at a specific moment, which
      may or may not translate into consistent effort or a habit. In contrast, Verb[volitional-よう]+にする
      specifically denotes a conscious, sustained effort to establish a regular habit.
    grammar_point: Verb[volitional-よう]+思う (intend to or think I will)
post_false_friends_writeup: The distinction among these similar expressions lies in the nature of the
  action and intent. 「Verb[volitional-よう]+にする」 emphasizes the ongoing, conscious effort to build a regular
  habit. 「～ようになる」 highlights a natural change or development in ability or a new state. 「～ことにする」 denotes
  a clear, often single-point decision to follow a specific course. Lastly, 「Verb[volitional-よう]+とする」
  focuses on an immediate attempt or on the brink of an action, without the implication of forming a lasting
  habit. 「Verb[volitional-よう]+思う」, while expressing intent, does not carry the connotation of forming
  a habit through sustained effort as 「Verb[volitional-よう]+にする」 does.

        english: Unfortunately, I didn't save money earlier.
        hint: The regret is specifically about not making the effort to establish a habit of saving money,
          not merely the fact that money wasn't saved. We're looking for a grammar point that describes

      persistent inaction.

      and conscious choice not to maintain tidiness, reflecting a mother's frustration with a long-standing
      issue and the absence of a desired habit. It highlights that he actively chooses not to even attempt
