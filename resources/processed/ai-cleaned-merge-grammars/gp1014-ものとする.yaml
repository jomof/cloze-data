    "etymology": "The expression 「ものとする」 combines 「もの」 (thing, matter) with 「と」 (as) and 「する」 (to do, to make). Literally, it means \"to make something as...\" and implies a strong determination or assumption.",
    "writeup": "The grammar expression 「ものとする」 is used to state a rule, a decision, or an assumption, particularly in highly formal or legalistic contexts. It conveys a strong directive or a definitive declaration of how something is to be handled or regarded. This often translates to \"shall\" or \"is to be considered\" in English.\n\nLike many grammar expressions that use 「もの」, this phrase implies that the word or phrase preceding it is a strong determination or a matter of fact. When 「とする」 (as (A), or in the capacity of (A)) is added, it solidifies a situation where the speaker or authority is establishing that (A) is true or required for the sake of discussion or enforcement. This is frequently seen in laws, contracts, official guidelines, and terms of service.\n\nWhile it is often used after verbs in their plain form, it differs from expressions like 「ものとして」. 「ものとして」 (literally, \"taking it as a thing\") implies an action or situation is being treated or considered in a certain way *for the purpose of an ongoing action or discussion*, often acting as an adverbial phrase. In contrast, 「ものとする」 almost invariably appears at the end of a sentence, serving as a declarative statement that establishes something as a fact, a rule, or an obligation.",
