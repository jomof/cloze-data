    "etymology": "The expression 「ものとする」 combines 「もの」 (thing, matter) with 「と」 (as) and 「する」 (to do, to make). Literally, it means \"to make something as...\" and implies a strong determination or assumption.",
    "writeup": "Like many grammar expressions that use 「もの」, this noun implies that the word or phrase before it is a strong determination. When 「とする」 'as (A)' or 'in the capacity of (A)' is added, it presents a situation in which the speaker is determining that (A) is true for the sake of discussion. In English, this may be interpreted as 'supposing that (A)' or 'on the assumption that (A)'. 「ものとする」, like 「ものとして」, will primarily be seen after verbs. However, unlike 「ものとして」, 「ものとする」 almost always appears at the end of a sentence and highlights things that are taken as facts in legalese and other forms of contractual writing. Primarily used in formal writing and legal documents to express rules, assumptions, or conditions.",
