    "writeup": "Like many grammar expressions that use 「もの」, this noun implies that the word or phrase that comes before it is a strong determination. When 「とする」 'as (A),' or 'in the capacity of (A)' is added, it presents a situation in which the speaker is determining that (A) is true for the sake of discussion. In English, this may be interpreted as 'supposing that (A),' or 'on the assumption that (A)'. 「ものとする」, like 「ものとして」, will primarily be seen after verbs. However, unlike 「ものとして」, 「ものとする」 will almost always appear at the end of a sentence, and highlights things that are being taken as facts in legalese and other forms of contractual writing. It indicates a formal declaration or a rule that is to be followed. It is often found in legal documents, regulations, and other official contexts where a clear and binding statement is required.",
    "etymology": "「もの」 generally refers to a thing or matter. 「と」 is a particle indicating 'as'. 「する」 means 'to do' or 'to consider'. Together, 「ものとする」 implies treating something as a specific matter or condition.",
