    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に当たる」 combines the particle 「に」 (ni), which indicates a target or direction, with the verb 「当たる」 (ataru), which means \"to hit,\" \"to strike,\" or \"to be equivalent to.\" Therefore, etymologically, it suggests the idea of 'hitting the mark' or 'being equivalent to' something.",
    "writeup": "The phrase 「に当たる」 (ni ataru) is often used to express correspondence, equivalence, or appropriateness. It's similar to 「に対して」 (ni taishite), but instead of opposition, 「に当たる」 signifies a match or equivalence. You can think of it as something 'hitting the mark.'\n\n*   It indicates that something (A) corresponds to, amounts to, or is equivalent to something else (B).\n*   The basic meaning is that (A) and (B) exist simultaneously, with (B) matching something about (A).\n*   「に当たる」 is versatile and can be translated as \"to correspond to,\" \"to amount to,\" \"to be appropriate for,\" or \"to be in regard to,\" depending on the context.\n\nTo use 「に当たる」, attach it to the end of a noun (A) that you want to mark as the reference point. (B) can come directly after 「に当たる」 or earlier in the sentence, as long as it's clearly separated from (A).",
