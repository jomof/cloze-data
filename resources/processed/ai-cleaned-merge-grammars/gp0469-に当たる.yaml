    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に当たる」 combines the particle 「に」 (ni), which indicates a target or direction, with the verb 「当たる」 (ataru). Originally, 「当たる」 meant \"to hit,\" \"to strike,\" or \"to come into contact with.\" Over time, its meaning expanded to include notions of fitting, coinciding, or being equivalent. Therefore, 「に当たる」 etymologically suggests the idea of 'hitting the mark' or 'being precisely equivalent to' something, signifying a direct match or correlation.",
    "writeup": "The phrase 「に当たる」 (ni ataru) is used to express correspondence, equivalence, or appropriateness. It is distinct from 「に対して」 (ni taishite), which typically implies opposition or contrast; instead, 「に当たる」 signifies a direct match, exact equivalence, or specific designation. You can think of it as something 'hitting the mark' or 'fitting precisely'.\n\n**Key Usages:**\n*   **Correspondence/Equivalence:** It indicates that one thing (A) is equivalent to, or corresponds to, another thing (B). This is often used when explaining a term or concept in relation to another, such as translating words between languages or identifying historical parallels.\n*   **Role/Position:** It can specify that someone or something holds a particular role, position, or relationship within a group or system. For example, identifying a person as a relative or a specific job function.\n*   **Timing/Event:** It refers to a specific time, date, or event coinciding with a particular milestone or period. For instance, marking an anniversary or a specific year in a sequence.\n\n**Structure:**\nTo use 「に当たる」, attach it to the end of a noun (A) that you want to mark as the reference point or the thing being corresponded to. The corresponding element (B) can appear before 「に当たる」 or elsewhere in the sentence, as long as the relationship is clear.\n\nWhile 「に当たる」 can sometimes be translated simply as 'is', its use emphasizes the precise fit or inherent nature of the correspondence, making it more nuanced than a simple declarative statement.",

Similarly, 「～になる」 describes a transformation or change, whereas 「に当たる」 describes an inherent or designated state of being equivalent or corresponding.
