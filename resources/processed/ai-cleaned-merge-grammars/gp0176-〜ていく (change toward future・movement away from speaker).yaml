formation:
  Verb (Te-form) + いく: Indicates that an action continues from a certain point forward, implying movement
    away from the speaker or a progression into the future.
  Verb (Dictionary form) + ように + して + いく: Expresses an ongoing effort or intention to proceed in a particular
    way.
  Verb in Te-form + いく: Indicates that something will start and continue, or that something is moving
    away from the speaker.
  Verb [て形] + いく: Describes an action that proceeds away from the speaker's current position, or a change
    that will continue from the present into the future.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The auxiliary verb 「行く」, *iku*, literally means "to go". When attached to the te-form of another
  verb, it describes the continuation or progression of that action or state from a certain point forward,
  metaphorically extending the idea of 'going' to the action itself. The directional aspect of 'going'
  is thus transferred to the ongoing process, implying a movement away from the start point of the action
  or change. The grammar point 「ていく」 is a combination of the 「て」-form of a verb and the verb 「いく」(iku),
  which means "to go." The 「て」-form connects actions, and 「いく」 indicates movement away from the speaker.
  Over time, this combination evolved to express the idea of something starting and continuing, or moving
  away. The auxiliary verb 「ていく」 combines the te-form of a verb with 「いく」, meaning "to go". This literally
  implies "to do something and go," extending its meaning to actions or states that proceed or move away,
  both physically and temporally, from the current point of reference.
writeup: 'The grammar point 「〜ていく」, *te iku*, is used to express the continuation of an action or a gradual
  change from a certain point in time. This ''point in time'' can be the present moment, indicating what
  will continue to happen in the future, or a point in the past, describing what has continued since then.
  The nuance of 「いく」 here is that the action or change progresses and moves *away* from the starting point,
  whether physically or metaphorically. Think of it as "going on" or "keeping" in English, but with an
  inherent sense of outward movement or progression over time. For example, if you say 「寒くなっていく」, it means
  it''s getting colder and the coldness is progressing or moving away from the current state, suggesting
  a continued decline in temperature. Similarly, 「話していく」 implies continuing to talk, with the conversation
  moving forward from its current point. This contrasts with other expressions of continuation that do
  not carry the directional nuance of 「いく」. While 「〜ていく」 itself is not gender-specific, the context and
  accompanying vocabulary can influence the overall tone and perceived register. It is widely used across
  all age groups and in various situations. This grammar construction combines the 「て」 particle with the
  verb 「行く」 (iku, "to go"). To use it, attach 「て」 to a verb, then follow it with 「いく」. The nuance is usually
  that "(A) happened and then went," or "will happen, and then go." In other words, it depends on whether
  「いく」 is in present or past tense. 「ていく」 can represent time or a physical place. When representing a
  physical place, the kanji form 「行く」 is more likely, but this isn''t a strict rule. When used in relation
  to time, the nuance is usually that something has already started or is about to start, and then will
  continue to progress in the same way. This is the opposite of 「てくる」, which indicates that something
  has finally reached a certain state after progressing in that way for some time. Compared to English,
  「ていく」 is similar to the phrase "to go on to (A)" in relation to time. It focuses on the speaker''s journey
  to a specific point. For example, "She went on to become a doctor after university." The grammar point
  「ていく」 is an auxiliary verb structure formed by taking the te-form of a verb and attaching 「いく」. It expresses
  two primary meanings: 1. **Physical Movement Away**: It describes an action that moves or proceeds away
  from the speaker''s current location or perspective. For instance, if a bird flies away, you would use
  「飛んでいく」 (to fly and go). 2. **Change Over Time (Continuing into the Future)**: This is often used to
  describe a process, change, or state that starts in the present and continues to progress or unfold
  into the future. It emphasizes the sense of something *going on* or *developing* forward in time. For
  example, 「暖かくなっていく」 means "it''s gradually getting warmer and will continue to do so," highlighting
  the ongoing nature of the temperature change. This usage often implies a process that is already underway
  or begins now and extends into an envisioned future. It''s crucial to understand that it emphasizes
  the progression *away* from the current state, moving towards a future state.'
false_friends:
  - term: 行く
    meaning: to go
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「行く」 by itself means 'to go,' referring to physical movement to a destination. In contrast,
      「〜ていく」 functions as an auxiliary verb, indicating the continuation or progression of an action or
      state over time, often with a sense of moving away from a current point. The key difference lies
      in whether 「行く」 is the main verb of movement or an auxiliary verb adding nuance to another verb.
    grammar_point: 行く (to go)
  - term: 〜てくる
    meaning: to come (continue, become)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜ていく」 implies progression or movement *away* from the speaker or a specific point in time,
      suggesting a future-oriented or departing direction. 「〜てくる」, its counterpart, implies progression
      or movement *towards* the speaker or a past-to-present direction, suggesting something that has
      continued up to the present or is approaching.
    grammar_point: 〜てくる (change toward present・movement toward speaker)
  - term: 〜はじめる
    meaning: to begin to (do something)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜ていく」 emphasizes the continuation or progression of an action or state *from* a certain point
      forward. 「〜はじめる」 focuses specifically on the *commencement* or *initiation* of an action, indicating
      when it started rather than its ongoing development. 「〜はじめる」 marks the starting line, while 「〜ていく」
      describes the journey itself, moving forward from that line.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]はじめる (to start doing)'
  - term: <suggest>:続ける (to continue doing)
    meaning: to continue
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「続ける」 simply means 'to continue' an action or state. While it denotes duration, it lacks the
      inherent directional nuance of 'moving away' or 'progression forward in time' that 「〜ていく」 provides.
      「〜ていく」 often implies a change or development over time, whereas 「続ける」 can be used for static continuation.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:続ける (to continue doing)
  - term: へいく (to head toward)
    meaning: To go to, To head toward
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「ていく」, 「へいく」 simply indicates direction or destination and doesn't imply an ongoing
      action.
    grammar_point: へいく (to head toward)
  - term: Verb+にいく (go to do)
    meaning: To go to ~, To go in order to ~
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「ていく」, "Verb+にいく" expresses the purpose of going somewhere, not the continuation of
      an action.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]に行く (to go in order to do)'
  - term: 〜つづける
    meaning: To continue doing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「つづける」 emphasizes the uninterrupted continuation of an action or state. While 「ていく」 also implies
      continuation, it specifically highlights the progression or change away from a starting point, or
      the process of something happening. 「つづける」 focuses more on the duration of the action itself, without
      necessarily emphasizing a directional or future-oriented change.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]つづける (to continue doing)'
post_false_friends_writeup: |-
  When using 「〜ていく」, it is essential to distinguish it from the plain verb 「行く」, which simply means "to go." While both involve the word 「行く」, their grammatical functions and meanings are distinct. The auxiliary 「〜ていく」 is always preceded by a verb in its te-form.

  Furthermore, pay close attention to the contrast between 「〜ていく」 and 「〜てくる」. The former emphasizes a sense of moving forward or away from a current state or point of origin, implying a future-oriented or outward progression. For example, 「暖かくなっていく」 means it is gradually becoming warmer, moving away from a colder state. The latter, 「〜てくる」, indicates a movement towards the speaker, either literally or metaphorically, suggesting that something has continued from a past point up to the present, or is approaching. For example, 「暖かくなってくる」 would mean it is gradually becoming warmer as it approaches the present moment or the speaker's location. Understanding this directional nuance is key to using these expressions correctly.

  Finally, compare 「〜ていく」 with 「〜はじめる」. While both relate to processes, 「〜はじめる」 focuses on the *initiation* of an action or state (e.g., 「走り始める」 - to start running), indicating the very beginning. In contrast, 「〜ていく」 describes the *continuation* or *progression* of an action *from* a certain point (e.g., 「走っていく」 - to continue running, to run off). 「〜はじめる」 marks the starting line, while 「〜ていく」 describes the journey itself, moving forward from that line.

  When considering the simple verb 「続ける」 (tsuzukeru), which means 'to continue', it's important to note the nuance it lacks compared to 「〜ていく」. While 「続ける」 merely indicates that an action or state persists without interruption, 「〜ていく」 adds the dimension of progression, development, or movement *forward* in time or space from a given point. For instance, 「勉強を続ける」 means 'to continue studying' (just keeping it up), while 「勉強を続けていく」 implies 'to continue studying, progressing forward' (with a sense of development or movement toward a future state). Therefore, 「〜ていく」 is often used when there's an implied trajectory or a noticeable change occurring over time, distinguishing it from a simple, static continuation.
  When using 「ていく」, remember that it implies continuation or movement away. Be careful not to confuse it with similar expressions like 「へいく」 (direction), "Verb+にいく" (purpose), 「はじめる」 (initiation), or 「てくる」 (approach/accumulation). Focus on whether the action is starting and continuing or simply a one-time event.
  When differentiating between 「ていく」 and 「てくる」, remember that 「ていく」 indicates an action or change that moves *away* from the speaker or the present moment, extending into the future. Conversely, 「てくる」 signifies an action or change that moves *towards* the speaker or the present, originating from somewhere else or the past. For example, 「飛んでいく」 (fly away) vs. 「飛んでくる」 (fly towards).

  As for 「つづける」 and 「はじめる」, while 「ていく」 often describes a continuous process, its core nuance is the *progression* of that process. 「つづける」 emphasizes mere endurance or uninterrupted continuation, and 「はじめる」 points specifically to the *commencement* of an action. So, while a process might 「はじまっていく」 (begin and continue), the focus of 「ていく」 is always on the forward movement or development.

          - これ から、日本 語 の 勉強 を 毎日 {続け ます}。
        english: From now on, I will continue my Japanese studies every day.
        hint: This sentence states the continuation of the study, but lacks the nuance of progression
          or moving forward into the future that 「〜ていく」 provides. We're looking for the progression of
          the study.
    scene: A student informs their teacher about their new study resolution, emphasizing a sustained effort.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「〜ていきます」 with the formal 「〜ます」 ending makes this a polite and determined statement
      suitable for addressing a teacher. It implies a continuous forward progression of the study. The
      placement of 「毎日」 (every day) can vary, but the meaning remains consistent. 「まいります」 is a more humble
      form of 「行きます」, showing respect to the listener.
    etymology: 「まいります」 is the humble form of 「行く」 and 「来る」, reflecting a speaker's humble approach to
      an action or movement.
  - english: From that day, he went on living alone.
    japanese:
      - その 日 から、彼 は 一人 で 生き て {いっ た}。

          - その 日 から、彼 は 一人 で {生き て い た}。
        english: From that day, he was living alone.
        hint: This sentence describes that he *was* living alone, but doesn't convey the sense of *how*
          he went on living alone or the progression of that state, which 「〜ていった」 emphasizes. We're looking
          for the progression of the state.
    scene: A narrator describes a character's life change after a significant event.
    register: casual
    setting: storytelling
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The casual past form 「〜ていった」 is common in narratives to describe a continuous state or action
      that progressed from a past point. It adds a sense of flow to the character's life story. The addition
      of 「のだ」 emphasizes the descriptive nature, often used in explanations or narratives. 「独り」 (hitori)
      and 「孤独」 (kodoku) are alternative ways to express 'alone' or 'loneliness', adding slightly different
      shades of meaning.
    etymology: 「のだ」 is a contracted form of 「のです」, providing an explanatory or emphatic nuance.
  - english: As summer approaches, it gradually gets hotter.
    japanese:
      - 夏 が 近づき、だんだん 暑く なっ て {いく}。

          - 夏 が 近づき、だんだん 暑く {なる}。
        english: As summer approaches, it gradually becomes hot.
        hint: This simply states that it becomes hot. 「〜ていく」 adds the nuance of a gradual, continuous
          change that progresses over time, moving away from the current state. We're looking for the
          gradual progression of change.
    scene: Someone observes the changing seasons and discusses the weather.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: This usage of 「〜ていく」 with an adjective (暑い) highlights a gradual, ongoing change over time.
      It's a common way to describe natural processes like seasonal changes. 「近づく に つれて」 (as it approaches)
      and 「迫り」 (drawing near) are more formal or literary alternatives for 'as it approaches'. 「ますます」
      (increasingly) and 「次第に」 (gradually) can replace 「だんだん」 to emphasize the progressive nature.
    etymology: 「につれて」 indicates a proportional relationship, meaning 'as X happens, Y also happens'.
  - english: From now on, I think I'll try to pay more attention to my health.
    japanese:

          - これ から、もっと 健康 に 気 を つける よう に {し よう} と 思う。
        english: From now on, I think I'll try to pay more attention to my health.
        hint: While this expresses an intention to make an effort, 「〜ていこう」 emphasizes the intention to
          *continue* that effort, suggesting a sustained future progression. We're looking for an intention
          for continued effort.
    scene: A person reflects on their future health habits during a conversation with a friend.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: volitional (～よう)
    nuance: The volitional form 「〜ていこう」 expresses an intention to continue an action or effort. The phrase
      「〜ようにしていく」 means 'to make an effort to continue doing something', emphasizing a sustained endeavor.
      「気 を 配る」 (to pay attention) is a slightly more polite alternative to 「気 を つける」. 「今後 は」 (from now
      on, future) and 「さらに」 (furthermore) can be used for a slightly more formal tone, especially with
      「〜と思います」 (I think) instead of 「〜と思う」.
    etymology: 「気 を 配る」 literally means 'to distribute one's spirit or attention', implying a broader
      focus on care.
  - english: Please continue to proceed with this project as is.
    japanese:
      - この プロジェクト は、この まま 進め て {いっ て ください}。

          - この プロジェクト は、この まま {続け て ください}。
        english: Please continue this project as is.
        hint: This is a direct request to continue the project. 「〜ていってください」 specifically requests that
          the project continue *moving forward* or *progression* from its current state, implying a dynamic
          continuation. We're looking for a command to continue with a sense of forward movement.
    scene: A manager instructs their team to keep working on a project without any changes.
    register: formal
    setting: commanding
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: The phrase 「〜ていってください」 is a polite command, emphasizing the continuation of the action into
      the future. It's suitable for professional settings where continuous work is expected. For higher
      formality, especially in business, one might use expressions like 「〜ていって いただけます と 幸い です」 (It would
      be fortunate if you would continue to do X) or 「〜ていって 頂けます でしょう か」 (Would you be able to continue
      to do X?), using more formal terms like 「本 プロジェクト」 (this project) and 「現状 維持」 (status quo maintenance).
    etymology: 「幸い です」 (saiwai desu) literally means 'it is happiness' or 'it is fortunate', a humble
      way to express gratitude or a request.
  - english: I want to continue to cherish and nurture my relationship with you.
    japanese:
      - 君 と の 関係 を 大事 に 育て て {いき たい} と 思っ て いる ん だ。
      - 君 と の 関係 を 大切 に 育ん で {いき たい} と 願っ て いる ん だ。

        english: I want to cherish and nurture my relationship with you.
        hint: This sentence expresses a desire to nurture the relationship. 「〜ていきたい」 adds the nuance of
          wanting to nurture it *continuously* and *progressively* into the future, emphasizing the ongoing
          development. We're looking for a desire for continuous nurturing.
    scene: A man expresses his feelings to his girlfriend, emphasizing the long-term aspect of their relationship.
    register: shitashii kuchō (intimate)
    setting: intimate
    conjugation: desiderative (～たい)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The combination of the desiderative form 「〜たい」 with 「〜ていく」 expresses a desire for an ongoing,
      continuous process. The use of 「君」 (kimi) and the casual 「〜んだ」 creates an intimate and heartfelt
      tone, often used by male speakers. 「大切 に 育んで」 (taisetsu ni hagukunde) is a more refined way to say
      'nurture carefully'. Using 「あなた」 and 「〜と思っています」 would make the expression slightly more formal,
      though still intimate depending on context.
    etymology: 「育む」 (hagukumu) means to foster or nurture, implying growth and development over time.
  - english: I decided I won't continue that bad habit anymore.
    japanese:
      - そんな 悪い 習慣 は、もう 続け て {いか ない} と 決め た。
      - あんな 悪癖 は、もう 継続 し て {いか ない} と 決心 し た。
      - もう、あの 悪しき 習慣 を 続け て {いく} こと は ない と 決め た。

      - competing_japanese:
          - そんな 悪い 習慣 は、もう {続け ない} と 決め た。
        english: I decided I won't continue that bad habit anymore.
        hint: While this clearly states the decision not to continue, 「〜ていかない」 emphasizes the cessation
          of something that was *progressing* or *ongoing* , implying a definitive halt to a continuous
          behavior. We're looking for a decision to stop something that was in progression.
    scene: Someone makes a firm decision to break a long-standing bad habit.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    nuance: The negative form 「〜ていかない」 emphasizes the cessation of an ongoing action, indicating a definitive
      break from a continuous process. It implies a conscious decision to stop something that has been
      progressing. 「悪癖」 (akueki) means 'bad habit' or 'vice', often used for ingrained bad habits. 「継続
      し て いかない」 is a more formal way to say 'will not continue'. The third option uses 「〜こと は ない」 (there
      will not be a doing of X) to express certainty about not continuing, which is very firm.
    etymology: 「悪癖」 combines 「悪」 (bad) and 「癖」 (habit/クセ), making a strong compound for negative habits.

        english: Even if it's tough, I believe I can grow.
        hint: This only indicates the ability to grow. 「〜ていける」 adds the nuance of the *ability to continue*
          growing or progressing into the future, emphasizing an ongoing development. We're looking for
          the ability to continue growing.
    scene: A student reflects on their personal development journey, maintaining an optimistic outlook
      despite challenges.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: potential (～られる/～える)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The potential form 「〜ていける」 combined with 「成長」 emphasizes the ability to continue growing or
      progressing, suggesting an inner strength or belief in one's capacity for ongoing development. 「大変

        english: If this situation continues, society might become even more difficult to live in.
        hint: While 「続けば」 implies continuation, 「〜ていけば」 specifically highlights a progression or gradual
          change *over time* into a new state. We're looking for a progressive change in the situation.
    scene: A sociologist discusses potential future challenges during a public lecture.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: conditional (～ば)
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The conditional 「〜ていけば」 here points to a hypothetical future scenario if the current trend
      (「この まま 続い て」) continues. It implies a progression into a potentially negative state. The formal
      register suits a general societal commentary. 「推移 し て いけば」 is a more formal and academic way to
      express 'if things transition/progression'.

          looking for a decision to stop a continuous behavior.

      independence.
    register: teineigo (polite)

    nuance: The negative polite 「〜ていきません」 expresses a resolute decision not to continue a certain action
      or state, with a sense of moving away from that past behavior. It's a polite but firm declaration
      of intent. The use of 「これ から は」 emphasizes a change in future behavior. 「他人」 and 「他者」 both mean
      'others', with 「他者」 being slightly more formal. 「依存」 is a more formal verb for 'rely'.

    scene: A man is leaving his house, and someone is observing his movement.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    nuance: The use of 「歩いていく」 emphasizes the action of walking and moving away from the speaker's current
      location or perspective, highlighting the continuous nature of his journey towards the park. It
      focuses on the action of 'walking' combined with 'going'.

        hint: 「届ける」 means 'to deliver' or 'to send,' focusing on the completion of the delivery rather
          than the action of carrying something away from the speaker's location. We're looking for an
          action that emphasizes taking something away.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 資料 は、山田 さん に 持っ て いっ て {ください}。
        english: While correct, this is a direct command. The original implies a more polite, indirect
          request asking if the listener can perform the action. We're looking for a softer, more deferential
          phrasing.
        hint: While correct, this is a direct command. The original implies a more polite, indirect request
          asking if the listener can perform the action. We're looking for a softer, more deferential
          phrasing.
    scene: A colleague asks another to deliver documents in a polite office setting.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: The use of 「持っていって いただけます か」 is a polite request that implies the act of carrying something
      away from the current location to another. It uses the te-form of 「いく」, making the request very
      formal and respectful in a business context. The combination of 「持って」 (holding) and 「いって」 (going)
      highlights the completion of the delivery task.
    etymology: The polite request form 「〜て いただけ ます か」 is a common and versatile expression used to ask
      for a favor in a humble manner, literally meaning "Can I receive the favor of you doing ~?"

        english: I'll copy and bring the necessary documents (with me) for the meeting.
        hint: 「持参する」 means 'to bring (something) with oneself,' often implying preparation for a specific
          event. While similar, it doesn't emphasize the action of 'taking away' as strongly as 「持っていく」.
          We're looking for an action that describes taking something from one place to another.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会議 に 必要 な 資料 を コピー し て {持っ て くる} よ。
        english: I'll copy the necessary documents for the meeting and bring them (here).
        hint: 「〜てくる」 indicates movement toward the speaker's location, whereas 「〜ていく」 indicates movement

          for an action that describes taking something away.
    scene: A person is telling a colleague their plan before a meeting.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)

      then move away with the result (the copied documents). The 「よ」 particle adds a sense of assertion
      or informing the listener of a decision.

          - この 素晴らしい 経験 を、これ から も 大切 に {し たい} です。
        english: I want to cherish this wonderful experience from now on.

post_example_writeup: Understanding the precise nuance of 「〜ていく」 in these examples is crucial. It is not
  merely about continuation, but about the direction and progression of that continuation. It highlights
  how an action or state moves forward from a certain point, often implying a change or development over
  time. 「ていく」 describes a process that starts and continues, whether physically moving away or progressing
  in time. The verb tense of 「いく」 indicates whether the action is ongoing or completed. Remember, it's
  the opposite of 「てくる」, which describes something approaching or accumulating over time. As illustrated
  by these examples, the versatility of 「ていく」 allows it to describe both literal physical movement away
  from a point of reference and abstract changes or processes that unfold and continue into the future.
  Pay close attention to the context to grasp whether a physical or temporal progression is implied.
