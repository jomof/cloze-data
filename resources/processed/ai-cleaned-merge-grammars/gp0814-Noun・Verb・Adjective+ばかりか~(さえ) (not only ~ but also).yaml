    "id": "gp0814",
    "jlpt": "N2",
    "meaning": "Not only...but also; much more than; in addition to.",
    "pronunciation": {
        "katakana": "バカリカ(サエ)",
        "romaji": "bakari ka (sae)"
    },
    "details": {
        "Register": "Can range from formal to casual, though often perceived as more formal than other similar expressions like 「だけでなく」.",
        "Usage": "Used to indicate that something is not only the case, but something more extreme or unexpected is also true. The part before 「ばかりか」 is typically something expected, while the part after is more surprising.",
        "Emphasis": "Adding 「さえ」 after 「ばかりか」 further emphasizes the unexpected nature of the latter part of the statement. 「さえ」 means 'even'.",
        "Parts of Speech": "Connects nouns, verbs, or adjectives.",
        "Nuance": "The speaker expresses surprise or emphasis at the additional fact presented after 「ばかりか」."
    },
    "formation": {
        "Verb (plain form) + ばかりか": "Indicates that 'not only' the action described by the verb occurs. This includes both non-past (e.g., 話すばかりか) and past (e.g., 話したばかりか) plain forms.",
        "い-Adjective (plain form) + ばかりか": "Indicates that 'not only' the state described by the い-adjective is true. This includes non-past (e.g., 高いばかりか) and past (e.g., 高かったばかりか) plain forms.",
        "な-Adjective stem + な/だった + ばかりか": "Indicates that 'not only' the state described by the な-adjective is true. This requires adding 「な」 for non-past (e.g., 静かなばかりか) or 「だった」 for past (e.g., 静かだったばかりか) plain forms.",
        "Noun + (だ/だった) + ばかりか": "Indicates that 'not only' the noun is applicable. For non-past, it often implies a silent 'だ' (e.g., 先生ばかりか), or 'だった' for past (e.g., 先生だったばかりか)."
    },
    "etymology": "「ばかり」 means 'only' or 'just', while 「か」 is a question particle. Together, they create a rhetorical question implying that the statement is not just limited to the first part, but extends further. Adding 「さえ」 amplifies the unexpectedness or extremeness of the second part of the statement.",
    "writeup": "「ばかりか」 is a grammatical construction used to convey that 'not only is X true, but also Y is true,' where Y is typically an additional fact that is more significant, surprising, or unexpected than X. It acts as a conjunction connecting phrases involving nouns, verbs, or adjectives. A crucial aspect of its usage is that the element preceding 「ばかりか」 represents something generally **expected** or less surprising, while the element following it introduces something **unexpected** or more extreme. This order is essential for the natural flow and meaning; reversing it would result in an unnatural expression. For instance, if one were to state something surprising first and then something expected, 「ばかりか」 would be inappropriate. While similar in meaning to 「だけでなく」, 「ばかりか」 often carries a more formal tone. The optional addition of 「さえ」 (meaning 'even') after 「ばかりか」 further intensifies the emphasis on the unexpected nature of the second part, underscoring the speaker's surprise or the extremity of the situation. Thus, 「AばかりかB(さえ)」 fundamentally conveys 'not only A, but even B'.",
