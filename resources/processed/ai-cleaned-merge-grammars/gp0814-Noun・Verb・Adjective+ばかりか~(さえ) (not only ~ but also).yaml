        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "usage-context": "Used to indicate that something is not only the case, but something more extreme or unexpected is also true. The part before the grammar point is typically something expected, while the part after is more surprising.",
        "function": "Connects phrases involving nouns, verbs, or adjectives, acting as a conjunction-like expression.",
        "nuance": "The speaker expresses surprise or emphasis at the additional fact presented after ばかりか. Adding さえ after ばかりか further emphasizes the unexpected nature of the latter part of the statement, meaning 'even'."
    },
    "etymology": "「ばかり」 means 'only' or 'just', while 「か」 is a question particle. Together, they create a rhetorical question implying that the statement is not just limited to the first part, but extends further. Adding 「さえ」 amplifies the unexpectedness or extremeness of the second part of the statement.",
    "writeup": "「ばかりか」 is a grammatical construction used to convey that 'not only is X true, but also Y is true,' where Y is typically an additional fact that is more significant, surprising, or unexpected than X. It acts as a conjunction connecting phrases involving nouns, verbs, or adjectives. A crucial aspect of its usage is that the element preceding 「ばかりか」 represents something generally **expected** or less surprising, while the element following it introduces something **unexpected** or more extreme. This order is essential for the natural flow and meaning; reversing it would result in an unnatural expression. While similar in meaning to 「だけでなく」, 「ばかりか」 often carries a more formal tone. The optional addition of 「さえ」 (meaning 'even') after 「ばかりか」 further intensifies the emphasis on the unexpected nature of the second part, underscoring the speaker's surprise or the extremity of the situation. Thus, 「AばかりかB(さえ)」 fundamentally conveys 'not only A, but even B'.",

            "term": "だけでなく",
            "meaning": "not only... but also",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「だけでなく」 is a more neutral and generally less formal expression than 「ばかりか」. While both convey 'not only A, but also B', 「だけでなく」 simply adds information without necessarily implying the surprise or unexpectedness that 「ばかりか」 emphasizes. It is often used in daily conversation."

        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To summarize, 「ばかりか」 carries a distinct nuance of **surprise or unexpectedness** regarding the second fact, making it more formal than its counterparts. In contrast, 「だけでなく」 is a more **neutral and generally casual** expression, simply adding information without emphasizing surprise. Lastly, 「ばかり」 means 'only' and does not involve adding a secondary fact; it merely specifies exclusivity. Selecting the appropriate expression hinges on the specific context and the speaker's intent to convey surprise, neutrality, or exclusivity.",
