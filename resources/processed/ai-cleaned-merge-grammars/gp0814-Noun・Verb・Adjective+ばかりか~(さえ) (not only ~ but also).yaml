    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ばかりか」 is used to express that something is not limited to what was initially mentioned, and it extends to something more significant or unexpected. It conveys the meaning of \"not only... but also.\" The particle 「さえ」can be added for further emphasis, meaning \"even.\"\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   The first part of the sentence introduces something expected or reasonable, while the second part presents something more surprising.\n*   This grammar is often used to emphasize a point or express a sense of wonder about the extent of something.\n*   It is similar to 「ばかりでなく」 and 「だけでなく」, but 「ばかりか」 often carries a stronger sense of surprise or unexpectedness.",
