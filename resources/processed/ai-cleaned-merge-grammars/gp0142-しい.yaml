        "function": "Intensifies the feeling or emotion associated with the base adjective.",
        "nuance": "Implies a subjective or deeply felt experience, often related to human emotions or senses.",

    "etymology": "The precise etymology of the suffix 「しい」 is not entirely settled among linguists, but it is widely understood to have developed as an intensifier for adjectives, particularly those conveying emotional states or subjective sensations. It is often traced back to the Classical Japanese adjectival suffix -し (-shi), which carried a similar function of imparting an emotional or descriptive quality. This historical usage reinforces its role in emphasizing deeply felt experiences rather than objective properties.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「しい」 attaches to the stem of an i-adjective to convey a strong, deeply felt emotion or subjective sensation. Unlike objective descriptive adjectives such as 「赤い (akai)」(red) or 「大きい (ookii)」(big) which describe measurable qualities, 「しい」 is characteristically used with adjectives that express internal states or feelings. This emphasis on subjective experience makes it commonly appear in words like 「悲しい (kanashii)」(sad) or 「嬉しい (ureshii)」(happy), where the feeling is personal and profound rather than externally quantifiable.",
