    "writeup": "The suffix 「しい」 is added to the stem of an i-adjective to emphasize a strong emotion or feeling. It signifies that the emotion is deeply felt or particularly intense. This suffix often applies to adjectives that describe internal states or subjective experiences. These adjectives are typically descriptive adjectives that are dependent on the speaker’s subjective judgment, so it would not be used to describe something objective like 「赤い (akai) - red」or 「大きい (ookii) - big」. It is much more commonly found connected to words like 「悲しい (kanashii) - sad」or 「嬉しい (ureshii) - happy」.",
