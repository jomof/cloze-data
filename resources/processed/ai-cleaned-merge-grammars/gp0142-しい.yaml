    "writeup": "The suffix 「しい」 is attached to the stem of i-adjectives to indicate a strong feeling or emotion associated with that adjective. It's often used when the emotion is deeply felt and not easily quantifiable. Adjectives without 「しい」 tend to be more descriptive and based on objective judgment, while those with 「しい」 highlight the subjective emotional experience. For example, 「楽しい (tanoshii)」 means \"fun,\" but 「楽しい**しい** (tanoshishii)」 emphasizes how deeply enjoyable something is. This suffix isn't used with all i-adjectives, but commonly appears with those expressing feelings or sensations.",
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「しい」 isn't definitively known, but it likely evolved from older forms of Japanese that were used to add emphasis or emotional weight to words. Over time, it became a common suffix for expressing strong feelings associated with certain adjectives.",
