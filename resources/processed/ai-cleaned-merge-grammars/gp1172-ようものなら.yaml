        "grammatical-role": "conjunctive phrase"
    },
    "etymology": "「よう」 is the volitional ending for verbs, signifying an intention or a hypothetical attempt. 「もの」 here acts as a nominalizer, turning the preceding clause into a general \"thing\" or \"matter,\" often implying a situation. 「なら」 is a conditional particle, meaning \"if\" or \"in the case of.\" Thus, 「ようものなら」 literally translates to something like \"if it were the case that one intended to do (something)\" or \"if such a thing were to happen.\" Over time, the combination has solidified to express a strong warning about dire consequences of a hypothetical action, building on the speculative and conditional nature of its component parts.",
    "writeup": "「ようものなら」 is a grammatical construction used to express a strong hypothetical conditional, specifically one that, if it were to occur, would lead to very undesirable or severe consequences. It carries a sense of warning or strong caution, implying that the outcome would be dire for the person or situation involved. This expression is more formal and literary, making it more common in written Japanese and formal speeches rather than casual conversation.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n*   **Strong Negative Connotation**: Unlike general conditional forms like 「たら」 or 「ば」, 「ようものなら」 explicitly highlights the highly negative or problematic outcome of the hypothetical situation.\n*   **Emphasis on Consequences**: The focus is heavily on the inevitable, unpleasant results if the action or event described by the volitional verb were to transpire.\n*   **Formal and Literary**: Its usage lends a more serious and sometimes dramatic tone, fitting for warnings, serious discussions, or literary contexts.\n*   **Volitional Form Precedes**: It always attaches to the volitional form of a verb, which in itself can imply intention or an attempt, thus emphasizing the act that would trigger the negative consequence.",
