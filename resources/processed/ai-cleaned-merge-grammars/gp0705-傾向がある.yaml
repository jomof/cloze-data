    "etymology": "The grammar point 「傾向がある」 is formed from the noun 「傾向 (keikou)」, meaning \"tendency\" or \"trend,\" and the verb 「ある (aru)」, meaning \"to exist\" or \"to have.\" Thus, literally, it means \"a tendency exists.\"",
    "writeup": "「傾向がある」 is a slightly formal grammar pattern indicating a \"trend\" or \"tendency.\" It combines the noun 「傾向」 (\"inclination\") and 「がある」 (\"to have\"), closely mirroring its English equivalent. As 「傾向」 is a noun, this structure follows verbs, い-adjectives, な-adjectives (with な), and nouns (with の). While 「がある」 is common, alternatives like 「が見られる」 (\"the trend of (A) can be observed\") also exist. It can describe both positive and negative trends. Be aware: 「傾向がある」 often describes stable behaviors or characteristics, while 「傾向にある」 focuses on ongoing changes.",
