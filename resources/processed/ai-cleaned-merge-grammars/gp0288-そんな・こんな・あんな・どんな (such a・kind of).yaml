details:
  part-of-speech: adjective
  register: casual
  usage-context: General
  function: To specify the type, kind, or quality of a noun based on its spatial or contextual proximity
    to the speaker or listener.
etymology: These terms are shortened forms of そのような (sono yō na), このような (kono yō na), あのような (ano yō na),
  and どのような (dono yō na). They directly modify nouns to indicate similarity or ask about the kind of something.
  The suffix -な (na) functions as a adjectival particle, akin to の (no) in some nominal contexts, indicating
  'such as' or 'of that kind'.
writeup: "**Sonna** (そんな), **konna** (こんな), **anna** (あんな), and **donna** (どんな) are commonly used to express\
  \ that something is \"like\" something else. Think of them as casual versions of そのような (sono yō na),\
  \ このような (kono yō na), あのような (ano yō na), and どのような (dono yō na). They directly precede the noun they\
  \ modify. \n\n*   **Konna** (こんな) means \"like this\" or \"this kind of,\" referring to something close\
  \ to the speaker.\n*   **Sonna** (そんな) means \"like that\" or \"that kind of,\" referring to something\
  \ close to the listener or something the speaker knows about.\n*   **Anna** (あんな) means \"like that\
  \ over there\" or \"that kind of over there,\" referring to something distant from both the speaker\
  \ and the listener.\n*   **Donna** (どんな) means \"what kind of?\" and is used to ask about the nature\
  \ or type of something."
false_friends:
  - term: そういう
    meaning: Like that, Kind of
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While こんな・そんな・あんな・どんな often imply a visual or immediate qualitative assessment, そういう is more
      general, referring back to a previously mentioned topic or situation rather than implying immediate
      spatial or sensory proximity.
    grammar_point: そういう (that kind of)
  - term: そんなに
    meaning: So (much), That much, Like that
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike こんな (konna), そんな (sonna), あんな (anna), and どんな (donna), そんなに (sonnani) is an adverb
      used to quantify degree, often with a negative, meaning "not that much" or "not so much," rather
      than describing a quality or kind of a noun.
    grammar_point: そんなに (that much or so)
  - term: いかなる
    meaning: What kind of, No matter what kind of, No … (with a negative verb), Any... (with a negative
      verb)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike the casual and general descriptive nature of こんな・そんな・あんな・どんな, いかなる is a more formal
      and often literary expression used to inquire about or emphasize the type of something, carrying
      a more definitive or encompassing tone.
    grammar_point: いかなる (no matter what kind of)
  - term: この・その・あの・どの
    meaning: This/that/which (specific object)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While こんな・そんな・あんな・どんな describe the 'kind' or 'quality' of a noun, この・その・あの・どの directly point
      to a specific noun without describing its nature or type.
    grammar_point: この・その・あの・どの (demonstrative determiners)
  - term: こう・そう・ああ・どう
    meaning: In this/that/which way
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike こんな・そんな・あんな・どんな which modify nouns to describe a 'kind' or 'quality' (adjectival function),
      こう・そう・ああ・どう are adverbs that modify verbs or adjectives, describing the 'manner' or 'way' of an
      action or state (adverbial function).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Demonstrative Adverbs (in this way)
  - term: 〜のような (like・similar to)
    meaning: Like, similar to, resembling
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While こんな・そんな・あんな・どんな directly describe the quality or kind of a noun based on its spatial
      relation to the speaker/listener (e.g., 'this kind of book'), 〜のような describes a noun by comparing
      it to something else (e.g., 'a book like a dictionary'). The former implies the actual kind, the
      latter implies resemblance.
    grammar_point: 〜ようだ・〜みたいだ (seems・like)
post_false_friends_writeup: The core distinction among these terms lies in their function and the nuance
  of proximity. こんな・そんな・あんな・どんな directly modify nouns to describe a 'kind' or 'quality' based on spatial
  or contextual closeness. In contrast, そういう refers to a type based on prior discussion or context, making
  it more about shared understanding than physical presence. そんなに is an adverb, quantifying degree rather
  than describing a noun's inherent quality. いかなる is a formal, emphatic way to ask 'what kind of'. この・その・あの・どの
  simply point to specific objects without describing their nature, while こう・そう・ああ・どう are adverbs describing
  the 'manner' of an action or state. Lastly, 〜のような compares a noun to something else, indicating resemblance,
  whereas こんな・そんな・あんな・どんな indicate the actual kind of the noun itself. Understanding these functional
  differences is key to their correct usage.

  そんな to things near the listener, あんな to things far from both, and どんな is interrogative. The longer forms
  (このような, そのような, あのような, どのような) convey a more formal or polite tone, often used in business or respectful
  conversations.
