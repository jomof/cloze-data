jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  function: Reportive; conveys information heard from a third party or source.
  nuance: Implies the speaker is relaying information they have learned or heard, often with a slight
    hint of surprise, uncertainty, or simply stating a fact they've understood. It's a casual contraction
    of 〜のだそうだ or 〜ということだ, carrying the explanatory 'n' nuance.
  grammatical-role: Sentence-ending expression
  logical-flow: Presents information as a report or explanation based on external knowledge.
etymology: The expression 「んだって」 is a casual contraction of 「のだそうだ」 or 「ということだ」. The 「ん」 part is a contraction
  of 「の」, which serves an explanatory or emphatic function, indicating that the speaker is presenting
  a reason or understanding. The final 「って」 is a casual quotation marker, derived from 「と言う」 (to say).
  Thus, it literally means 'It is that one says' or 'It is said that...', making it a direct way to report
  heard information.
writeup: 「んだって」 is a highly common and versatile casual expression used to report information that the
  speaker has heard from someone else, or from a general source like news or rumors. It functions as a
  direct, informal equivalent to more formal hearsay expressions such as 「〜そうだ」 or 「〜とのことです」. The 「ん」
  (a contraction of 「の」) adds an explanatory or emphatic nuance, suggesting that the speaker is presenting
  information they've come to understand or are explaining a situation based on what they've learned.
  It is frequently employed in everyday conversations among friends, family, or close colleagues in informal
  settings. While its primary role is to indicate reported speech, it can also subtly convey surprise,
  skepticism, or simply a straightforward relay of information. Due to its casual nature, it should be
  strictly avoided in formal or polite contexts. Its usage is pervasive across all genders and ages in
  casual speech.
false_friends:
  - term: 〜らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)
    meaning: It seems that... / I hear that...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「んだって」, which directly reports what was heard, 「らしい」 implies information gathered from
      indirect evidence or general rumor, often conveying a sense of probability or conjecture rather
      than a direct report.
    grammar_point: らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)
  - term: 〜そうだ (it is said)
    meaning: I hear that... / It is said that...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both convey hearsay, 「そうだ」 is typically more direct and can apply to general news or
      direct observation (appearance). 「んだって」, being a contraction of 「のだそうだ」, often carries a stronger
      explanatory or empathetic nuance, implying the speaker has processed or understood the information.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Sentence]そうだ (I heard・it is said)
  - term: 〜って (quotation marker, casual)
    meaning: They said... / (Topic marker, casual)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The simple 「って」 functions as a general casual quotation marker, directly citing someone's
      words or introducing a topic. It lacks the explanatory 「ん」 nuance of 「んだって」, which specifically
      indicates that the speaker has understood or is explaining the reported information.
    grammar_point: って (quotation marker, casual)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between these expressions, consider the source and the
  speaker's nuance. 「んだって」 is a casual, often explanatory, report of what was heard. 「らしい」 suggests information
  based on inference or less direct evidence, often with a hint of uncertainty. 「そうだ」 (hearsay) is a more
  straightforward report of information, frequently used for general news. The bare 「って」 is a simple,
  casual quotation or topic marker, lacking the deeper explanatory context of 「んだって」.
