    "writeup": "The conjunction 「且つ・かつ」 connects words, phrases, or sentences, similar to \"and\" in English. It is typically used in **formal writing and speech**. While it conveys a meaning similar to 「そして」 or 「また」, 「且つ」 carries a more sophisticated tone, making it suitable for academic, legal, or business contexts. 「且つ」 is versatile, linking not only nouns but also adjectives and verbs. It presents a more refined alternative to simpler conjunctions in formal communication.",
    "etymology": "The term 「且つ」 is derived from classical Chinese and maintains a formal tone in modern Japanese. It is constructed from 「且」 (shō), meaning \"moreover\" or \"for the time being,\" and the particle 「つ」, functioning as a conjunction. This etymology underlines its role in adding information or conditions, akin to 'moreover' or 'furthermore.'",
