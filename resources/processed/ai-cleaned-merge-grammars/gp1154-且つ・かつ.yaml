        "part-of-speech": "conjunction",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Primarily used in formal writing and formal speech, such as academic papers, legal documents, business reports, official announcements, and formal presentations.",
        "function": "Connects words, phrases, clauses, or sentences of equal importance, indicating an additive relationship.",

    },
    "etymology": "The word 「且つ」 originates from classical Chinese, where it also functioned as a conjunction meaning \"and.\" It retains a formal tone in modern Japanese, reflecting its historical usage in written and official contexts.",
    "writeup": "「且つ」 (katsu) is a conjunction meaning \"and,\" \"moreover,\" or \"furthermore.\" It is used to connect words, phrases, clauses, or entire sentences, indicating that the preceding and following elements are of equal importance or present simultaneously. Its primary characteristic is its high level of formality, making it suitable for academic papers, legal documents, business reports, and formal speeches.\n\n### Usage Contexts\n*   **Formal and Written Language**: 「且つ」 is almost exclusively found in formal written Japanese and highly formal spoken contexts. It is rarely used in casual conversation.\n*   **Emphasis on Conjunction**: Unlike simpler conjunctions like 「と」 or 「そして」, 「且つ」 often carries a nuance of emphasizing that the two connected elements are both true, present, or required, often complementing each other to form a complete picture.\n*   **Connecting Various Grammatical Forms**: As illustrated in the formation section, 「且つ」 can connect verbs, adjectives, nouns, and even entire clauses, demonstrating its versatility in formal Japanese.\n\n### Important Considerations\nWhile 「且つ」 translates to \"and,\" it implies a stronger, more integrated connection between the elements than a simple additive conjunction. It suggests that the two conditions or qualities are simultaneously relevant or required.",
