        "part-of-speech": "conjunction",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Primarily used in formal writing and formal speech, such as academic papers, legal documents, business reports, official announcements, and formal presentations.",
        "function": "Connects words, phrases, clauses, or sentences of equal importance, indicating an additive relationship.",
        "nuance": "More formal and often more emphatic than other conjunctions like と or そして; emphasizes the addition of information and conveys a sense of formality and precision."
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「且つ」 originates from classical Chinese, where it also functioned as a conjunction meaning \"and.\" It retains a formal tone in modern Japanese, reflecting its historical usage in written and official contexts.",
    "writeup": "「且つ」 (katsu) is a conjunction used to connect words, phrases, clauses, or even entire sentences, conveying the meaning of \"and,\" \"moreover,\" or \"furthermore.\" Its defining characteristic is its high level of formality, making it almost exclusively found in formal written Japanese and highly formal spoken contexts, such as academic papers, legal documents, business reports, and official speeches. It is rarely used in casual conversation.\n\nUnlike simpler conjunctions such as 「と」 or 「そして」, 「且つ」 often carries a nuance of emphasizing that the two connected elements are both true, present, or required, frequently complementing each other to form a complete picture. This emphasis implies a stronger, more integrated connection between the elements than a simple additive conjunction. It suggests that the two conditions or qualities are simultaneously relevant or required.\n\n「且つ」 is highly versatile in its ability to connect various grammatical forms, including:\n\n*   **Verbs**: It can connect verb ます-stems (連用形) or て-forms, showing two actions or states occurring together or successively.\n*   **Negative Verb Forms**: When used with the ず-form of verbs, it links a negative state with another condition or action.\n*   **Adjectives**: It connects both い-adjectives (in their く-form or くて-form) and な-adjectives (often with で, であり, or であって), linking two descriptive qualities.\n*   **Nouns**: Used with であり or であって, it connects nouns, indicating that something possesses dual identities or characteristics.\n*   **Negations**: It can also connect negative forms of adjectives or nouns (e.g., なく), indicating that something is not one thing, and additionally, something else.\n*   **Adverbial Forms**: A common usage is to connect two adverbial forms of adjectives (e.g., 早く且つ正確に), highlighting two simultaneous manners of action or qualities.\n*   **Clauses with 「こと」**: It can formally connect two clauses ending in 「こと」, typically for listing conditions, requirements, or facts in official contexts.\n\nIn summary, 「且つ」 is employed when a precise, formal, and emphatic connection is required, stressing the simultaneous validity or combined importance of the elements it joins.",
