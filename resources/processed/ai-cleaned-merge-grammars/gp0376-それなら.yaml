    "etymology": "「それ」 refers back to the previously mentioned situation or statement. 「なら」 is the conditional form of the copula 「だ」, indicating 'if that is the case'. Therefore, 「それなら」 literally means 'if that is the case'.",
    "writeup": "「それなら」 acts as a conjunction, highlighting that if the previous statement (A) is true, then a subsequent statement (B) will likely also be true or needs consideration. It can be interpreted as \"if that's the case, then (B)\". 「それなら」 is most often used when replying to something another person has just said. In these instances, it introduces a guess, suggestion, or consideration regarding the previous statement. 「だったら」 and 「それだったら」 have similar meanings and can be used interchangeably.",
