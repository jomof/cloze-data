    "etymology": "「それ」 refers back to the previously mentioned situation or statement. 「なら」 is the conditional form of the copula 「だ」, indicating 'if that is the case'. Therefore, 「それなら」 literally means 'if that is the case'.",
    "writeup": "「それなら」 acts as a conjunction, highlighting that if the previous statement (A) is true, then a subsequent statement (B) will likely also be true or needs consideration. It can be interpreted as \"if that's the case, then (B)\". 「それなら」 is most often used when replying to something another person has just said. In these instances, it introduces a guess, suggestion, or consideration regarding the previous statement. While often used in polite contexts, its register is flexible and adapts to the surrounding sentence. 「だったら」 and 「それだったら」 have similar meanings and can be used interchangeably.",

            "nuance": "「それでは」 is used to transition to a new topic or action, often concluding a discussion. 「それなら」 focuses on a condition based on previous information, while 「それでは」 is more of a transitional phrase."
