details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: bungo (literary)
  usage-context: Primarily used in formal writing, speeches, historical texts, or by characters in fiction
    (especially older individuals or those in positions of authority) to convey a sense of solemnity,
    wisdom, or definitive judgment rather than simple speculation.
  function: To express a conjecture or presumption about a state or action, often with a nuance of certainty
    or strong belief on the speaker's part.
  nuance: Carries an archaic, literary, or formal tone, often conveying a sense of solemnity, authority,
    or a reflection on established truths rather than personal speculation. It implies the speaker's deep
    consideration or confidence in the probability.
etymology: The grammar point 「かろう」 is derived from the archaic indeterminate form 「かろ」 of an い-adjective,
  combined with the auxiliary verb 「う」. This construction is reminiscent of older forms like 「よかろう」 which
  is the predecessor of 「いいだろう」.
writeup: '「かろう」 is an archaic grammar pattern used to express conjecture or presumption. While its modern
  equivalents are 「だろう」 or 「でしょう」, 「かろう」 carries a distinct old-fashioned and literary nuance. It implies
  a strong probability or a confident assertion from the speaker''s perspective, often rooted in their
  experience or authority. This form is not typically encountered in everyday modern Japanese conversation.
  You will primarily find it in: **Formal writing and speeches:** It lends an air of solemnity and erudition.
  **Historical texts and classic literature:** Reflecting the language of past eras. **Fictional characters:**
  Particularly older characters, figures of authority, or those speaking with a philosophical or profound
  tone, to emphasize their wisdom, age, or status. To use 「かろう」, simply replace the final 「い」 of an い-adjective
  with 「かろう」。 For negative conjectures involving い-adjectives, な-adjectives, or nouns, the form 「なかろう」
  is used. This is derived from the negative auxiliary 「ない」 (which functions as an an い-adjective), forming
  「ない」 + 「かろう」 = 「なかろう」。 Thus, for な-adjectives and nouns, it becomes 「〜ではなかろう」 (e.g., 「静かではなかろう」, 「医者ではなかろう」).
  While this grammar point is generally gender-neutral in its formal usage, its appearance in modern media
  often sees it employed by male characters or in contexts that evoke traditional masculinity or authority,
  given its archaic feel. However, this is more of a stylistic association than a grammatical rule. Likewise,
  its use by older characters is a common trope to convey age and experience, but not a strict limitation.'

  - term: だろう
    meaning: Probably; I think; ..., right?
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だろう」 is the standard, modern equivalent used for general conjecture in casual and informal
      contexts. Unlike 「かろう」, it lacks the archaic or formal nuance.
    grammar_point: だろう (conjecture)
  - term: でしょう
    meaning: Probably; I think; ..., right? (polite)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「でしょう」 is the polite form of 「だろう」, suitable for formal or semi-formal situations. While polite,
      it still lacks the deep archaic or authoritative nuance found in 「かろう」.
    grammar_point: でしょう (conjecture and confirmation)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「だろう」 and 「でしょう」 are the common ways to express conjecture in modern
  Japanese, 「かろう」 adds an antiquated flair to your speech or writing. Be mindful of your audience and
  context when choosing which to use.

          - この 古い 巻物 は、非常 に 価値 が 高い だろう。
        english: This ancient scroll is probably very valuable.
        hint: The setting of archaeological discovery and the academic nature of the speaker's thoughts
          lean towards a more formal and almost pronouncement-like conjecture, which 'かろう' provides, unlike
          the more casual 'だろう'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 古い 巻物 は、非常 に 価値 が 高い でしょう。
        english: This ancient scroll is probably very valuable.
        hint: Similar to 'だろう', 'でしょう' is polite but lacks the archaic and authoritative weight that 'かろう'
          brings to a statement about something of such historical importance.
    scene: An archaeologist unearthing a dusty, ancient scroll in a newly discovered ruin, contemplating
      its significance.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker, an archaeologist, uses 「高かろう」 to convey a solemn, almost definitive judgment
      about the scroll's value, fitting the formal and authoritative tone of academic discovery. The word
      「巻物」 (scroll) itself adds to the ancient context.

        english: Any hardship will probably heal with time.
        hint: The grandmother's role as a source of timeless wisdom makes 'かろう' a more appropriate choice
          than the informal 'だろう', as it implies a truth learned through life experience rather than simple
          speculation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - どんな 苦難 も、時 が 経て ば 癒さ れる もの でしょう。
        english: Any hardship will probably heal with time.
        hint: While polite, 'でしょう' doesn't carry the same weight of established truth or the comforting,
          slightly archaic wisdom that 'かろう' imparts in this reflective and empathetic context.
    scene: A kindly old woman, sitting by a window overlooking a serene garden, offers words of solace
      to her grieving granddaughter.
    register: formal
    setting: supportive
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The grandmother's use of 「かろう」 here imbues her words with a gentle, timeless wisdom, suggesting
      this is a universal truth derived from life experience. The phrase 「どんな 苦難 も」 (any hardship) further
      emphasizes this broad, philosophical perspective.

        english: That new movie probably wouldn't be interesting for children.
        hint: The speaker's reflective tone, making a judgment for a child's entertainment, utilizes the
          formal and slightly distanced 'なかろう' to express a confident prediction, unlike the more casual
          'だろう'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 新しい 映画 は、子供 に とっ て、面白く は ない でしょう。
        english: That new movie probably wouldn't be interesting for children.
        hint: While polite, 'でしょう' would imply a degree of seeking agreement or politeness that isn't
          present in the speaker's internal, conclusive thought, which 'なかろう' better conveys.
    scene: A parent looks at a movie poster, considering if it's suitable for their child's taste, and
      concludes it's not.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The speaker's use of 「面白くは なかろう」 indicates a firm, internal conclusion about the movie's appeal
      to children, reflecting a sense of certainty characteristic of 「かろう」. The inclusion of 「は」 emphasizes
      the contrast with other movies that might be interesting.

          - 緊急 事態 と は いえ、この 問題 は、それ ほど 重要 で は ない だろう。
        english: Although it's an emergency, this issue is probably not that important.
        hint: The leader's assertive, declarative tone, even in a crisis, requires the formal and confident
          '重要ではなかろう' to convey a definitive assessment rather than the more uncertain 'だろう'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 緊急 事態 と は いえ、この 問題 は、それ ほど 重要 で は ない でしょう。
        english: Although it's an emergency, this issue is probably not that important.
        hint: Using 'でしょう' would introduce politeness or a hint of tentativeness, which would undermine
          the leader's decisive and reassuring posture in a serious situation, making 'なかろう' more appropriate.
    scene: A calm leader assessing various concerns during a crisis, prioritizing by downplaying the significance
      of a particular issue.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The leader's use of 「重要ではなかろう」 asserts a calm, confident assessment of the situation, even
      amidst an emergency. This formal phrasing emphasizes their authority and rational judgment, suggesting
      that the issue is truly not of high priority.

          - 彼 は 決して 卑怯 者 で は ない だろう。
        english: He is certainly not a coward.
        hint: The general's position of authority and the serious context of defending an officer's honor
          demand a more resolute and less speculative tone than 'だろう' typically offers. 'なかろう' provides
          that conviction.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 決して 卑怯 者 で は ない でしょう。
        english: He is certainly not a coward.
        hint: Even with politeness, 'でしょう' can imply a degree of uncertainty or seeking agreement, which
          would undermine the general's firm defense. 'なかろう' makes it a statement of strong belief.
    scene: A military general, known for his stern demeanor, publicly defending the character of a subordinate
      officer against accusations of cowardice.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The use of 「なかろう」 by a general emphasizes a strong, almost irrefutable assertion, reinforcing
      the speaker's authority and conviction. 「決して」 (never/certainly not) further strengthens this definitive

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 疑念 を 抱く 者 は 少ない だろう。
        english: There are probably few who harbor doubts.
        hint: The CEO's persuasive and confident tone, aiming to instill belief, benefits from the slightly
          more formal and declarative '少なかろう' over the more casual '少ない だろう', which could imply hesitation.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 疑念 を 抱く 者 は 少ない でしょう。
        english: There are probably few who harbor doubts.
        hint: While polite, 'でしょう' might still suggest a hint of questioning or politeness, whereas the
          CEO here needs to convey an unwavering truth to motivate her team, a role '少なかろう' fills more
          aptly.
    scene: A charismatic CEO, standing before a large whiteboard filled with strategic diagrams, delivering
      an inspiring speech to her team about an ambitious new project.

      any doubt would be an anomaly. This tone is authoritative and persuasive, aiming to unite the team
      behind the plan. 「成功 する に 違いない」 (will certainly succeed) sets up this expectation.

          - 若い 者 に は、この 伝統 の 意味 は 分から ない だろう。
        english: A young person probably wouldn't understand the meaning of this tradition.
        hint: The speaker's age and role as a master reflecting on 'tradition' suggests a statement born
          of profound experience and a degree of inherent authority, which 'なかろう' captures more effectively
          than the more common 'だろう'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 若い 者 に は、この 伝統 の 意味 は 分から ない でしょう。
        english: A young person probably wouldn't understand the meaning of this tradition.
        hint: While polite, 'でしょう' would sound too conversational for the speaker's reflective and slightly
          condescending tone, which emphasizes the gap in understanding between generations through the
          use of archaic language.
    scene: An elderly master craftsman, whose hands are gnarled from decades of work, observes his young
      apprentice struggling with an intricate technique, musing about the deeper spiritual aspects of

    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The speaker uses 「分からなかろう」 with an air of experienced wisdom, subtly emphasizing the generational
      gap and the presumed lack of understanding from younger individuals. The phrase 「若い 者」 (young people)
      and the overall context of a master imparting knowledge contribute to this nuance.

    japanese:

          and authoritative 'かろう', which conveys a stronger sense of certainty than the more common 'だろう'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 平和 条約 は、後世 に 転換 点 と 記憶 さ れる でしょう。
        english: Future generations will probably remember this peace treaty as a turning point.

          the weight of a considered pronouncement, suitable for academic discourse.
    scene: A historian presenting research on a significant historical event, emphasizing its lasting
      impact.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The historian uses 「記憶されかろう」 to convey a confident historical projection, emphasizing the
      lasting significance of the treaty. The phrase 「後世に」 (for future generations) adds to the solemn,
      historical context, making the statement sound like an established truth.
  - english: Such a betrayal would probably not be forgiven by anyone.
    japanese:
      - その よう な 裏切り は、誰 に も {許さ れ なかろう}。
      - 誰 に も その よう な 裏切り は {許さ れ なかろう}。
      - '{許さ れ なかろう}、その よう な 裏切り は、誰 に も。'

          - その よう な 裏切り は、誰 に も 許さ れ ない だろう。
        english: Such a betrayal would probably not be forgiven by anyone.
        hint: The philosophical reflection and the speaker's deep conviction about the unforgivable nature
          of betrayal are better expressed with the strong, absolute tone of 'なかろう' rather than the more
          common and less emphatic 'だろう'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - その よう な 裏切り は、誰 に も 許さ れ ない でしょう。
        english: Such a betrayal would probably not be forgiven by anyone.
        hint: Using 'でしょう' would introduce a polite or tentative nuance, which is unsuitable for the speaker's
          firm, almost universal judgment on a severe ethical matter. 'なかろう' provides that resolute closure.
    scene: A philosopher contemplating the nature of forgiveness and human morality after a profound act
      of betrayal.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)

    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: The speaker's use of 「許されなかろう」 reflects a profound, almost absolute judgment about the unforgivable
      nature of the betrayal. The phrase 「誰にも」 (by anyone) underscores the universal application of this
      severe judgment, fitting the philosophical context and lending an air of established truth.

        english: The true path of justice will probably always be a difficult one.
        hint: The wise judge's solemn instruction to new apprentices benefits from the archaic and weighty
          'かろう', which conveys a timeless truth, unlike the more casual and less impactful 'だろう'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 正義 の 真 の 道 は、常 に 困難 な もの でしょう。
        english: The true path of justice will probably always be a difficult one.
        hint: While 'でしょう' is polite, it lacks the deep, authoritative wisdom and solemnity that an elder
          conveying a fundamental principle would use, making 'かろう' the more appropriate choice.
    scene: An old, respected judge addressing a group of new legal apprentices, imparting fundamental
      wisdom about their future profession.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male

      The phrase 「正義の真の道」 (the true path of justice) emphasizes the profound and timeless nature of the
      statement, fitting the mentor's role in conveying deep, historical wisdom.
post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, 「かろう」 consistently lends a tone of solemnity,
  authority, or timeless wisdom to the statement, whether it is an affirmative conjecture or a negative
  one. Its usage often signals that the speaker is delivering a considered judgment or a reflection on
  a profound truth, rather than just a casual guess.
