        "[Noun] + を経て": "Indicates passing through a place or time, or going through an experience."

        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "Used in formal contexts such as biographies, official documents, and academic writing to describe a process, period, or experience that has been undergone.",
        "function": "Indicates that the preceding noun (a stage, time, or experience) has been undergone or passed through, leading to a subsequent state or action.",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes the significant process or journey involved, focusing on what was experienced during the passage rather than just the endpoint. It implies a certain degree of effort, time, or transformation inherent in the 'passing through'.",
        "grammatical-role": "Connects a noun representing a temporal or experiential stage to a predicate describing the outcome or result of having passed through that stage.",
        "temporal-flow": "Highlights a sequential flow where an event or outcome follows a period of undergoing or experiencing the preceding noun."
    },
    "etymology": "「経 (へ)」 is from the verb 「経る (へる)」 meaning \"to pass through,\" \"to experience,\" or \"to elapse.\" The particle 「を」 marks the noun as the object that is being passed through or experienced.",
    "writeup": "「を経て」 is a formal grammar point used to emphasize the passage of time, an event that took a certain amount of time, or a process one has undergone. 「経る」 itself is a verb meaning \"to elapse\" or \"to pass\" in terms of time. Unlike 「過ぎる」, which focuses on reaching the endpoint, 「経る」 emphasizes the events and changes that occur during the entire period leading up to that end point.\n\nBecause of this emphasis, 「を経て」 can often be translated as \"having undergone (A)\" due to its focus on the preceding action. It directly follows a noun, and the rest of the sentence usually describes the significance of that period or experience, or what happened as a result.\n\nAs a formal structure, 「を経て」 is often found in biographies, introductions, and similar media.",

This highlights the nuance of 「を経て」 which focuses on the process and experiences within the duration, unlike 「～た後で」 which simply indicates a sequential action."

                    "mitigation": "Similar to 「～た後で」, 「～てから」 primarily denotes sequence. The scene helps to steer the learner towards 「を経て」 by focusing on the transformative nature of the 'going through' two years of dating, rather than just the order of events."
