    "etymology": "「経 (へ)」 is from the verb 「経る (へる)」 meaning \"to pass through,\" \"to experience,\" or \"to elapse.\" The particle 「を」 marks the noun as the object that is being passed through or experienced.",
    "writeup": "「を経て」is a formal grammar point used to emphasize the passage of time, an event that took a certain amount of time, or a process one has undergone. 「経る」 itself is a verb meaning \"to elapse\" or \"to pass\" in terms of time. Unlike 「過ぎる」, which focuses on reaching the endpoint, 「経る」 emphasizes the events and changes that occur during the entire period leading up to that end point.\n\nBecause of this emphasis, 「を経て」 can often be translated as \"having undergone (A)\" due to its focus on the preceding action. It directly follows a noun, and the rest of the sentence usually describes the significance of that period or experience, or what happened as a result.\n\nAs a formal structure, 「を経て」is often found in biographies, introductions, and similar media.",
