    "etymology": "「代（かわ）り」 means \"substitute\" or \"replacement.\" The particle 「に」 indicates direction or purpose, thus 「代わりに」 literally means \"in the direction of being a substitute\" or \"for the purpose of being a replacement.\"",
    "writeup": "「代わりに」 (kawari ni) is used to express that something or someone is acting as a replacement or substitute. It can also indicate doing something in exchange for something else.\n\n*   When used with verbs, it means \"instead of doing\".\n*   When used with nouns, it means \"in place of\".\n*   It can also express compensation, like \"in exchange for\" or \"to make up for\".\n\n「代わりに」 is often used at the beginning of sentences to introduce a preferable alternative. In such cases, it translates to \"rather than that\" or \"instead\".",
