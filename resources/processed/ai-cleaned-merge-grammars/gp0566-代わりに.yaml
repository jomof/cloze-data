    "etymology": "「代（かわ）り」 means \"substitute\" or \"replacement.\" The particle 「に」 indicates direction or purpose, thus 「代わりに」 literally means \"in the direction of being a substitute\" or \"for the purpose of being a replacement.\"",
    "writeup": "「代わりに」 (kawari ni) is used to express that something or someone is acting as a replacement or substitute. It can also indicate doing something in exchange for something else.\n\nWhen used with verbs, it means \"instead of doing.\" When used with nouns, it means \"in place of.\" It can also express a compensatory relationship, like \"in exchange for\" or \"to make up for,\" where one aspect balances out another.\n\nOccasionally, 「替わり」, meaning \"to exchange,\" may be used instead of 「代わり」, meaning \"to substitute.\" However, within the context of this particular grammar structure, there is little to no change in nuance.\n\n「代わりに」 is often used at the beginning of sentences to introduce a preferable alternative. In such cases, it translates to \"rather than that\" or \"instead.\"",
