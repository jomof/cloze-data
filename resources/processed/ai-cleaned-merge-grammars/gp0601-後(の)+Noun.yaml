    "etymology": "「後(あと)」 literally means \"behind\" or \"after\". It is used to indicate what comes after a certain point in a sequence or what is left over. The の particle connects 後 to the noun it modifies, indicating possession or association.",
    "writeup": "One of the common uses for the noun 「後(あと)」, meaning \"behind\" or \"after\", is to express a remainder, or everything after a certain point. This can be translated as 'what's left of (A)', 'the rest of (A)', 'what's remaining of (A)', or even 'other than (A)'. 「後」 will be grouped with the case-marking particle 「の」 before nouns, come directly before numbers, or be used at the beginning of whole phrases. Despite having many different translations, the base meaning of 「後」 will always be to identify a sequence of things and what comes 'after' or 'behind' a specific point in that sequence.",
