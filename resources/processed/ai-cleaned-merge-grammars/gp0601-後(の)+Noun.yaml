    "etymology": "「後(あと)」 literally means \"behind\" or \"after\". It is used to indicate what comes after a certain point in a sequence or what is left over. The の particle connects 後 to the noun it modifies, indicating possession or association. This sense of 'what follows' or 'what is left' is fundamental to its various applications.",
    "writeup": "One of the common uses for the noun 「後(あと)」, meaning \"behind\" or \"after\", is to express a remainder, or everything after a certain point. This can be translated as 'what's left of (A)', 'the rest of (A)', 'what's remaining of (A)', or even 'other than (A)'. When specifying a noun, 「後」 will be grouped with the case-marking particle 「の」 (e.g., 『後の本』, \"the rest of the books\"). It can also come directly before numbers (e.g., 『後3日』, \"3 more days left\"), or be used adverbially with quantities (e.g., 『後少し』, \"a little bit more\"). When used alone as a nominal, 「後」 can refer to 'the rest' or 'what comes next' (e.g., 『後は』). Despite having many different translations, the base meaning of 「後」 will always be to identify a sequence of things and what comes 'after' or 'behind' a specific point in that sequence.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While sharing the same kanji, 『あと』 used adverbially or as a standalone nominal without の + Noun often refers to a temporal \"after\" or a general \"remaining amount\" in a more casual, less structured way than 『後(の)+Noun』 which explicitly modifies a noun or a number.

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 『後』 can often be translated similarly to 『残り』 or 『残る』, its core nuance emphasizes what comes *after* a certain point in a sequence or what is *behind* something already specified. 『残り』 tends to focus more on a quantifiable portion that is literally 'left over', and 『残る』 is the verb for 'to remain'. The general use of 『あと』 (without 『の』 and a noun) is a broader term for 'after' or 'later', sometimes overlapping in meaning, but 『後(の)+Noun』 specifically forms a noun phrase to describe the *remaining item or group* within a defined context.",
