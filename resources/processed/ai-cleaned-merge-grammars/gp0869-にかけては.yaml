        "Noun + にかけては": "Used to express that within a specific field or domain, the topic is superior or has a distinct advantage."
    },
    "jlpt": "N2",
    "meaning": "When it comes to, regarding, concerning",
    "meaning_warning": "Do not confuse with AからBにかけては (over some period of time/area). This use of にかけては emphasizes a range or duration, not expertise.",
    "details": {
        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "formal",
        "usage-context": "General use, particularly when highlighting a unique skill or strong point.",
        "function": "Emphasizes a person's or entity's strength, excellence, or distinct advantage in a particular area.",
        "nuance": "This expression exclusively highlights positive attributes or superior capabilities. It is considered unnatural and grammatically incorrect to use it to describe negative aspects or weaknesses."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point derives from 掛ける (kakeru), which means \"to hang\" or \"to suspend.\" The ににかけては construction metaphorically \"hangs\" the focus on a particular topic, indicating a specialty or expertise.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「にかけては」 is used to emphatically highlight someone's exceptional ability, skill, or excellence within a particular area or domain. It conveys a strong sense of superiority, often implying that nobody can surpass the subject in that specific field. It is akin to saying, \"When it comes to X, Y is unparalleled.\" This grammatical structure is strictly used for positive attributes. It is unnatural to employ 「にかけては」 to describe negative qualities or deficiencies. Always ensure the statement following 「にかけては」 reflects a positive or superior characteristic of the subject. This grammar point follows a noun that specifies the field or domain being discussed.",

Finally, 「にとって」 expresses a perspective or impact on someone. Understanding these precise differences is crucial for accurate and natural Japanese expression.",
