    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from the verb 「掛ける」(kakeru), meaning \"to hang, to wager, or to dedicate,\" combined with the particle 「に」 (ni) indicating location/direction, and 「は」 (wa) serving as the topic marker. The phrase literally implies 'on the matter that has been hung/placed,' evolving to mean 'regarding' or 'concerning.'",
    "writeup": "「にかけては」 is used to express that someone or something excels or has a distinct advantage in a specific field or area. It follows a noun that represents the field being discussed. The structure is 「(A)にかけては(B)」, meaning \"when it comes to (A), (B)\".  It always implies a positive aspect or strong point within (B). Therefore, it's unnatural to use this grammar point to highlight a negative aspect. Be cautious not to confuse this grammar point with the 「にかけて」 that indicates a time frame within which something occurs. This grammar point is versatile and can be used in various contexts, from everyday conversations to more formal discussions.",
