    "etymology": "The grammar point derives from 掛ける (kakeru), which means \"to hang\" or \"to suspend.\" The ににかけては construction metaphorically \"hangs\" the focus on a particular topic, indicating a specialty or expertise.",
    "writeup": "The expression 「にかけては」 is used to emphasize someone's strength or excellence in a particular area. It is similar to saying \"when it comes to X, nobody can beat Y.\" It always expresses a positive attribute or distinct advantage within a specific field. It's crucial to use this grammar point when highlighting positive aspects. Using it to point out negative qualities is considered unnatural. Note that 「にかけては」 differs from the 「にかけて」 used to indicate a timeframe.",
