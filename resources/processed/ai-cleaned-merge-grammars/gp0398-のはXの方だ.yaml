        "function": "emphasis, clarification, gentle assertion",
        "nuance": "This structure softens a direct statement, implying 'it's on the side of X' rather than 'it is X'. It often highlights contrast or takes responsibility in a nuanced way."
    },
    "etymology": "The construction is built from: 「の」 (nominalizer), 「は」 (topic marker), 「方」 (direction/side) and 「だ」 (copula). Literally, it means 'the one on the side of X,' which implies something more nuanced than a direct assertion, often used for emphasis or to soften a statement by indicating one 'side' is responsible or relevant.",
    "writeup": "「のはXの方だ」 is an expression used to emphasize that X is the one responsible for or associated with a certain action or situation. It highlights a particular element or person, often against the backdrop of other possibilities or expectations. While directly stating 'X is Y' with simple particles like が or は suffices for factual statements, adding 「の方だ」 introduces a nuance of 'being on the side of' or 'being affiliated with,' which can either soften a potentially harsh assertion or provide a clearer, more emphatic identification.\n\nThe grammar point consists of the following components:\n\n*   **のは**: This part nominalizes the preceding phrase, turning it into a noun clause. 「は」 acts as a contrastive topic marker, drawing attention to what follows.\n*   **X**: This is the noun or noun phrase that identifies 'the one' being emphasized.\n*   **の方だ**: 「の」 is a possessive or specifying particle, and 「方」 (hō) literally means 'side' or 'direction.' Together with the copula 「だ」 (or its polite form 「です」), it expresses 'it is on the side of X.' This indirectness makes the statement less blunt.\n\nThis pattern is frequently used to accept responsibility apologetically, implying 'I am the one responsible,' even if there are other contributing factors. It also serves to clarify who or what is truly at fault, or who fits a particular description, especially when there might be a misunderstanding or a need for precise identification.",

While '私 が 遅れました' states the fact, 'のは私の方です' emphasizes that *I* am the one, despite any potential unspoken factors or external circumstances, taking full ownership of the tardiness.
