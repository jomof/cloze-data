    "writeup": "「のはXの方だ」 is used to emphasize that X is the one responsible for or associated with a certain action or situation. It highlights a particular element or person, often against the backdrop of other possibilities or expectations. \n\nThe grammar point consists of:\n\n*   「のは」: Nominalizes a phrase, turning it into a noun clause.\n*   「方だ」: Indicates \"the one on the side of,\" subtly assigning responsibility or association.\n\nOften, this pattern is used apologetically to express that someone feels they are the one responsible for a certain outcome.",
