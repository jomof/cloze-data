    "etymology": "The word 「ずつ」 originally comes from the verb 「続く(つづく)」 (tsuzuku), meaning \"to continue.\" This etymology reflects the grammar point's nuance of something happening repeatedly or gradually.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「ずつ」 is used after a noun, especially a quantity, to indicate things that occur or exist in specific amounts, intervals, or increments. It's similar to saying \"each,\" \"per,\" or \"at a time\" in English. Depending on the source, 「ずつ」 may be considered an adverbial particle. The kanji form 「宛」 literally means \"allotment\" and is related to distinct groupings.",
