        "usage-context": "Used to describe quantity, frequency, or a gradual process. Can be applied to both discrete items and continuous actions.",
        "function": "Indicates a uniform distribution or incremental progress.",
        "nuance": "Emphasizes the 'at a time' or 'per' aspect, highlighting that the action or state occurs in consistent, often equal, increments.",

    "etymology": "The word 「ずつ」 originally comes from the verb 「続く (つづく)」 (tsuzuku), meaning \"to continue.\" This etymology reflects the grammar point's nuance of something happening repeatedly or gradually.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「ずつ」 is employed after a noun, typically a quantifier, to denote phenomena that occur or exist in specific amounts, intervals, or increments. Its function is analogous to English expressions such as \"each,\" \"per,\" or \"at a time.\" While some linguistic analyses classify 「ずつ」 as an adverbial particle, its application remains consistent regardless of categorization. The kanji form 「宛」, which literally translates to \"allotment,\" further illuminates the concept of distinct, uniform groupings. It is important to distinguish this use of 「宛」 from its more common reading of 「あて」 when referring to an address or destination.",
