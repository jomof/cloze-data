    "etymology": "The term 「左右(さゆう)」 literally means \"left and right.\" The etymology of 「左右する」 comes from the idea of controlling something's direction, similar to how one uses reins to guide a horse to the left or right. This sense of direction evolved to mean having control over a situation or influencing its outcome.",
    "writeup": "「左右する」(さゆうする) is a compound verb formed from the noun 「左右」(さゆう), meaning \"left and right,\" and the verb 「する」(suru), meaning \"to do.\" Its literal origin evokes the image of controlling direction, much like guiding a horse by its reins to move left or right. Over time, this concept evolved to signify a powerful form of influence or control over a situation or outcome.\n\nThis grammar point conveys a direct and significant command or impact, making it notably stronger than simply \"to affect\" or \"to influence\" (影響する). While 「影響する」 implies a general effect or indirect influence, 「左右する」 suggests a decisive role, akin to \"to dictate,\" \"to govern,\" or \"to dominate\" in English. It implies moving something \"exactly as one wishes\" (思うままに動かす).\n\n「左右する」 can be used transitively, directly followed by the object it influences (e.g., [Noun] を 左右する). It is also very commonly seen in its passive form, 「左右される」(さゆうされる), to express that something is being influenced or controlled by an external factor (e.g., [Noun] に 左右される). This passive form often describes situations where an entity is at the mercy of circumstances or other forces.",

Lastly, while 「支配する」 can be a strong synonym, it often carries a connotation of dominance or oppression, which 「左右する」 does not always imply.",
