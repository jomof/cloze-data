details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used to emphasize that a certain outcome, understanding, or realization is dependent
    on a specific preceding action or condition, often implying it is the only or most crucial way to
    achieve it.
  function: Expresses a necessary condition or prerequisite.
  nuance: Highlights a strong sense of conditionality or necessity, implying that something can only be
    achieved or truly understood *because* of a preceding action or experience. It conveys that the first
    action is a necessary condition for the second, often implying a profound or unique insight.
  grammatical-role: Functions as a strong conditional or causal link.
  logical-flow: A causes B, and A is an indispensable condition for B.
  temporal-flow: Action A must precede or be sustained for Outcome B.
etymology: The particle 「こそ」 originates from the classical Japanese emphatic particle こそ (koso), which
  intensified the preceding word or phrase. When combined with the て-form of a verb, this pattern evolved
  to create a strong sense of conditionality and necessity, stressing that the action expressed by the
  て-form is indispensable for the consequence or outcome that follows. It highlights that the preceding
  action is the absolute, most critical means to achieve something.
writeup: 「Verb[て]+こそ」 emphasizes that a particular action or condition is **essential** for a certain
  outcome. It conveys the idea that something can only be realized, understood, or appreciated *because*
  of a preceding action or experience. It's similar to saying "only if," "precisely because," or "not
  until" something happens. The nuance is that the first action is a **necessary condition** for the second.
  This grammatical pattern is widely applicable in various contexts, from personal growth to professional
  achievements, highlighting indispensable prerequisites.
false_friends:
  - term: からこそ
    meaning: Emphasized because; Precisely because
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While 「Verb[て]+こそ」 implies a necessary condition, 「からこそ」 emphasizes the reason or motivation
      behind something, often conveying a stronger sense of causation or unique circumstance.
    grammar_point: からこそ (emphasized reason)
  - term: こそ
    meaning: For sure; For certain; Even more so; Underlined or bolded text
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「こそ」 by itself is an emphatic particle that highlights the word it follows. 「Verb[て]+こそ」 adds
      the crucial aspect of conditionality, specifying that the preceding action is the essential means
      to an outcome.
    grammar_point: こそ (emphasis)
  - term: 〜ばこそ
    meaning: Precisely because; Only because; Due to
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「〜ばこそ」 is a more formal and literary expression with a similar meaning, often implying a sense
      of sacrifice or devotion. 「Verb[て]+こそ」 is generally more versatile and commonly used in everyday
      speech for highlighting necessary conditions.
    grammar_point: ばこそ (precisely because)
  - term: 〜たら
    meaning: Conditional; If; When; After
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「〜たら」 indicates a general conditional or sequential relationship without the strong emphasis
      on necessity that 「〜てこそ」 conveys. While both express 'if/when', 「〜てこそ」 implies the action is indispensable
      for the result, whereas 「〜たら」 is a more neutral consequence.
    grammar_point: たら (if・when・after)
  - term: 〜ば
    meaning: If... then (conditional)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「〜ば」 expresses a general conditional, often stating a common truth or a necessary condition
      for a result. However, it lacks the emphatic nuance of 「〜てこそ」 which stresses that the preceding
      action is the *only* or *most crucial* way to achieve the outcome.
    grammar_point: ば (conditional)
  - term: て初めて
    meaning: For the first time after
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both indicate something happens *after* an action, 「Verb[て]+こそ」 emphasizes that the
      action is the *indispensable means* for the outcome, whereas 「Verb[て]初めて」 highlights that the action
      is the *trigger* for something to happen for the first time.
    grammar_point: て初めて (for the first time after)
post_false_friends_writeup: These expressions all involve emphasis or conditionality, but 「Verb[て]+こそ」
  specifically highlights a preceding action or condition as an indispensable prerequisite for a particular
  outcome or a deeper understanding. Unlike 「Verb[て]初めて」, which denotes an event occurring for the first
  time as a result of a preceding action, 「Verb[て]+こそ」 focuses on the preceding action being the essential
  and often singular path to the subsequent outcome or realization. 「からこそ」 emphasizes the reason, 「こそ」
  is a general emphatic particle, and 「〜ばこそ」 is more formal and often implies a selfless motive. In contrast,
  conditionals like 「〜たら」 and 「〜ば」 indicate a consequence or general truth but do not carry the same strong
  nuance of absolute necessity or singular means that 「〜てこそ」 does.

  crucial** means to achieve the subsequent result.
