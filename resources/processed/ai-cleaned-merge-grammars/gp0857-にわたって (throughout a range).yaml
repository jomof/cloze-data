  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used in formal, often written contexts such as news reports, official documents, or academic
    papers, emphasizing the comprehensive nature of the span.
  function: Indicates that an action, state, or phenomenon extends or applies over an entire range, span,
    or duration.
  nuance: Emphasizes the comprehensiveness and continuity of the span, suggesting that something covers
    the entire extent from beginning to end.
  grammatical-role: Adverbial when used as にわたって; attributive when used as にわたる.
etymology: This grammar point is derived from the verb 「渡る(わたる)」 (wataru), meaning "to cross" or "go across."
  The 「に」 (ni) indicates direction or location, and 「わたって」 (watatte) is the te-form of 「渡る」 (wataru).
  Together, they create the sense of something extending or spanning across a given area or period, much
  like crossing from one side to the other.
writeup: |-
  「にわたって」 (ni watatte) signifies that an action, state, or phenomenon extends across a certain range, whether it's a period of time, a physical area, or a numerical range. It is often translated as "across," "throughout," or "over." This pattern is rooted in the verb 「渡る」 (wataru), which means "to cross," thereby implying that the entire span from beginning to end is covered or affected.

  This grammatical structure is highly **formal** and is frequently encountered in written materials such as news articles, official announcements, academic papers, and formal speeches. When used attributively before a noun, it changes to 「にわたる」 (ni wataru).

  It is crucial that the specific span being referred to is clearly indicated, as 「にわたって」 emphasizes the **comprehensiveness** and **continuity** over that entire extent. Unlike more general expressions, it highlights the full coverage of the specified duration or area.

    meaning: Over (a period), from ~ until, through
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「にかけて」 (ni kakete) implies a direction, progression, or a range that is not necessarily fully

  - term: で
    meaning: At, in (location of action)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「で」 simply marks the location where an action occurs, or within which something exists. 「にわたって」,
      however, emphasizes that something *spreads across* or *covers* an entire area, highlighting its
      widespread nature rather than just a single point or contained space.
    grammar_point: で (location of action)
post_false_friends_writeup: While both 「にわたって」 and 「にかけて」 can refer to a span of time or area, their nuances
  differ. 「にわたって」 stresses the full and continuous coverage of the entire span from beginning to end.
  In contrast, 「にかけて」 often suggests a progression or a range from one point *towards* another, or a general
  period, without necessarily implying full, continuous coverage. For example, 「明日は関東にわたって雨でしょう」 (ashita
  wa Kantō ni watatte ame deshō) means "Tomorrow, it will rain throughout the Kanto region," indicating
  widespread rain. However, 「明日は関東にかけて雨でしょう」 (ashita wa Kantō ni kakete ame deshō) would imply that the
  rain will spread towards or into the Kanto region from another area, or that it will rain intermittently
  across the region.
