jlpt: N1
etymology: 「限り」 (kagiri) comes from the verb 「限る」 (kagiru), meaning 'to limit,' 'to restrict,' or 'to
  confine.' The particle 「で」 (de) here functions to indicate a means, method, or condition, meaning 'by
  means of this limit' or 'within the confines of this limit.' This combination highlights its role in
  explicitly setting boundaries, whether of knowledge, time, or physical extent, emphasizing that the
  statement holds true *only* up to that defined boundary and no further.
writeup: |-
  「限りで」 is a versatile phrase used to establish a clear boundary or limit for the statement that follows. This limit can pertain to various aspects such as **time**, **knowledge**, **ability**, **scope**, or **duration**.

  When combined with a **noun**, 「限りで」 typically translates to 'to the extent of [Noun]' or 'only with [Noun]'. For instance, 「今日限りで」 signifies 'only for today' or 'as of today,' emphasizing the finality of a period or condition. This usage often implies a definite cut-off point.

  When paired with a **dictionary form verb**, 「限りで」 expresses 'as long as [Verb]' or 'to the extent that [Verb]'. This construction often conveys that a statement's truth or validity is conditional upon the verb's action or state. A particularly common and important nuance of this usage is to convey the **limit of one's knowledge or perception**. In such cases, it is frequently translated as 'as far as I know/can tell/remember,' adding a layer of tentativeness or humility by stating that the information provided is based solely on the speaker's current understanding or available data.

  It is crucial to differentiate 「限りで」 from other expressions that use 「限り」, as the word 「限り」 itself can serve various functions (e.g., 「〜限り」 meaning 'as long as/to the extent that' without 「で」, or 「限りだ」 expressing 'the utmost degree'). 「限りで」 specifically emphasizes the *boundary*, *endpoint* or *sole condition* of a statement or scope.
false_friends:
  - term: だけ
    meaning: only, just
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だけ」 is a general limiter, simply stating 'only X.' 「限りで」 often implies 'only X, and nothing
      beyond that' or 'only X is applicable/true,' conveying a stronger sense of finality or exclusivity.
    grammar_point: だけ (only・just)
  - term: 限り
    meaning: limited to, as long as (used with Nouns)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「[Noun]限り」 can denote a general restriction or scope, such as 「法律の限り」 (within the limits of
      the law). 「限りで」 often implies a specific *endpoint* or *sole condition* for what follows, like 「本日限りで」
      (as of today, the final day).
    grammar_point: '[Noun]限り (limited to)'
  - term: 限り
    meaning: as long as, to the extent that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 'This emphasizes continuity or duration: ''as long as X is true/happening.'' 「限りで」 (especially
      with verbs) can share this meaning but often carries a stronger sense of a **final point** or **sole
      determinant** for the validity of the statement (e.g., 「私が知っている限りで」 implies the limit of *my current
      knowledge*).'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:[Verb-dictionary]・[Noun-の]限り (as long as・to the extent that)
  - term: 限りだ
    meaning: the utmost, peak of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This expresses an extreme or ultimate feeling/state (e.g., 「嬉しい限りだ」 meaning 'I'm as happy
      as can be'). 「限りで」, in contrast, always denotes a boundary, limit, or scope for a condition or statement.
    grammar_point: '[Adjective]限りだ (the utmost・peak of)'
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「限りで」 expresses a limit or scope, other expressions using 「限り」 or similar
  particles can have different nuances. For instance, 「[Noun]限り」 often indicates a general restriction,
  like "within the limits of the law." In contrast, 「限りで」 used with a noun, such as 「本日限りで」, emphasizes
  a specific endpoint or exclusivity. When 「限りで」 is used with a verb in the plain form, it indicates "as
  long as" or "to the extent that," similar to 「[Verb-dictionary]限り」. However, 「限りで」 frequently implies
  that the statement's validity hinges *solely* on that condition or information, often signaling the
  speaker's limited knowledge (e.g., 「私が知っている限りで」). Meanwhile, 「[Adjective]限りだ」 is used to express an
  extreme degree of emotion or state, completely different from setting a boundary. Lastly, while 「だけ」
  simply means "only," 「限りで」 provides a more formal or emphatic sense of limitation, often implying that
  something exists or is valid *up to* a certain point and no further.

  the scope of a statement, whether to signify an absolute end, an exclusive condition, or the extent
  of one's knowledge. Paying attention to the context and the preceding noun or verb will help you grasp
  the specific limitation being conveyed.
