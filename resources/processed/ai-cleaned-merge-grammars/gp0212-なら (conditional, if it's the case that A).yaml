details:
  part-of-speech: conjunction
  register: casual
  usage-context: General
  function: expresses a condition or supposition
  nuance: implies a subjective judgment or supposition about the condition, often used when responding
    to something someone has said or observed.
  counterpoint: Differs from ば and たら in its emphasis on the speaker's assumption or a specific hypothetical
    case.
  grammatical-role: connects a conditional clause to a main clause
  logical-flow: A (assumption/premise) なら B (consequence/action)
  temporal-flow: The condition can be present, past, or future.
etymology: 「なら」 is considered to be an abbreviation of 「ならば」, the hypothetical form of 「なり」, a classical
  auxiliary verb. 「なり」 originally meant "to be," similar to the auxiliary verb 「だ」. This explains its
  use with nouns and na-adjectives. Unlike 「だ」, 「なら」 can be attached directly to verbs and i-adjectives
  without needing to nominalize them using 「の」. Its core meaning relates to "being" or "existence," which
  evolved into "if it is the case that X."
writeup: The grammar point 「なら」 expresses a condition or supposition. It translates to "if," "if it's
  the case," or "as for." It's essentially a shortened version of 「ならば」. Originating from the classical
  auxiliary verb 「なり」, which meant "to be" (similar to modern 「だ」), 「なら」 functions with a similar sense
  of establishing a premise. It commonly pairs with nouns and な-adjectives directly, often omitting the
  copula 「だ」. Crucially, unlike 「だ」, 「なら」 can also attach directly to verbs and い-adjectives without needing
  nominalization (e.g., using 「の」). 「なら」 is particularly used when the speaker is making a judgment or
  assumption based on what *they perceive* or what *has been said*, rather than stating universal truths
  or automatic consequences. It sets up a condition that leads to a specific action or statement from
  the speaker. It's important to note that this usage is distinct from the particle 「なり」, which can mean
  "as soon as" or "just after."

  - term: ば
    meaning: If… then, (Conditional)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ば」 indicates a more general or habitual condition, or a natural consequence. 「なら」 often refers
      to a specific situation or an assumption of a present/future state, often in response to something.
    grammar_point: ば (conditional, if A then B)
  - term: こそ
    meaning: For sure, For certain, Precisely because
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「こそ」 emphasizes the preceding word or phrase as the *reason* or *source*. 「なら」 introduces
      a condition that serves as a premise for a subsequent statement or action.
    grammar_point: こそ (emphasis)
  - term: ばあいは
    meaning: In the event of, In the case of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ばあいは」 specifies a particular event or circumstance. 「なら」 offers a more general condition
      or a supposition based on perceived information, often leading to a specific piece of advice or
      action.
    grammar_point: ばあいは (in the event of)
  - term: としたら・とすれば・とすると
    meaning: If it were the case that, Assuming that...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: These phrases introduce a hypothetical or speculative situation, often with a sense of 'what
      if.' 「なら」 states a more direct condition often based on immediate information or assumption, or
      an observed reality.
    grammar_point: としたら (if assuming)
  - term: たら
    meaning: When, From when, Just when, If
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たら」 indicates a condition that leads to a result *after* the condition is met, and can also
      refer to a completed action. 「なら」 is purely conditional, often used to respond to something previously
      stated or observed, focusing on the premise itself rather than its completion.
    grammar_point: たら (conditional, when・if A then B)
  - term: と (quotation)
    meaning: If, When, Whenever, As soon as (natural consequence)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「と」 in conditional sentences describes natural consequences or habitual actions that *automatically*
      follow. 「なら」 specifies a particular condition or a supposition related to the speaker's judgment,
      leading to a decision or suggestion.
    grammar_point: と (conditional, inevitable result)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the subtle differences between 「なら」 and other conditional forms
  is crucial for natural Japanese. While all express "if," they differ in nuance and usage. 「なら」 emphasizes
  the speaker's judgment or supposition about the condition, often used when responding to an observed
  situation or someone's statement. 「ば」 suggests a more general or habitual condition that yields an automatic
  result. 「たら」 indicates a condition that leads to a result after the condition is met, and can also refer
  to a completed action. 「と」 denotes an automatic consequence or habitual action. For highly hypothetical
  or speculative situations, 「としたら」 or 「とすれば」 are often more appropriate. Choosing the right conditional
  requires considering the specific context and the speaker's intent and perspective.

    scene: Asking a colleague for assistance.
    register: teineigo (polite)

        english: If it is indeed expensive, I won't buy it.

        english: If it were the case that it's a joke, that's fine, but if it were the case that it's
          real, I won't forgive you.
        hint: 「だとしたら」 implies a more hypothetical or speculative scenario. Here, the speaker is directly
          confronting a situation and stating terms based on their perception, making 「なら」 more suitable
          for a direct conditional.
    scene: Expressing serious boundaries.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker, a woman, is drawing a line, stating 「許さないよ」 if it's not a joke, based on the
      condition 「冗談ならいいけど」. The repeated use of 「なら」 emphasizes her direct confrontation of the perceived
      reality. The 「よ」 at the end adds a strong assertion.
  - english: If that's the case, there's nothing we can do.
    japanese:
      - そう {なら}、仕方 が ない ね。
      - そう {なら} ば、仕方 が ない ね。
      - そう {なら}、仕方 ない ね。
      - もし そう {なら}、どう しよう も ない ね。
    english_literally: If it is so, there is nothing that can be done, right?

      - competing_japanese:
          - そう {だっ たら}、仕方 が ない ね。
        english: If that had been the case, there would be nothing we could do.
        hint: 「だったら」 might imply a completed past event or a stronger hypothetical leading to a result.
          We're looking for a current acceptance of an understood situation, which 「なら」 conveys directly
          as a response to a premise.
      - competing_japanese:
          - そう {だ と し たら}、仕方 が ない ね。
        english: If that were the case, there's nothing we can do.
        hint: 「だとしたら」 implies a more hypothetical or speculative scenario. We're looking for a direct
          acceptance of an understood current situation, which 「なら」 conveys more simply as a response.
    scene: Accepting a situation.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: The speaker is expressing acceptance of an unchangeable situation, indicated by 「仕方がないね」,
      implying a resignation based on the premise stated by 「そうなら」. The 「ね」 softens the statement, seeking
      agreement.
