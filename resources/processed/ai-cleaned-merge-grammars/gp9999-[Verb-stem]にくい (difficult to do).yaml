formation:
  Verb-stem + にくい: Expresses difficulty in performing an action.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The ~にくい suffix is believed to originate from the classical Japanese verb にくし (nikushi), meaning
  "unpleasant" or "hard to bear." This underlying meaning of unpleasantness or difficulty connects to
  its modern usage of expressing inherent difficulty or a negative quality of an action, making something
  "hard to deal with" or "unpleasant to do."
writeup: |-
  The suffix ~にくい attaches to the stem of a verb to express that an action is "difficult to do" or "hard to do." It functions grammatically like an い-adjective.

  This construction indicates an inherent difficulty or a negative quality associated with performing the action. It's not merely about the speaker's personal inability or subjective feeling, but rather that the nature of the action itself, or the circumstances surrounding it, makes it generally hard. For example, if a road is 歩きにくい (aruki-nikui - hard to walk on), it implies the road's condition (e.g., bumpy, steep) makes walking difficult for anyone, not just the speaker.

  ~にくい can also carry a nuance of something being "unpleasant" or "undesirable" to do, echoing its etymological roots in words like 憎い (nikui - hateful/detestable). For instance, 言いにくい (ii-nikui - hard to say) can mean it's difficult to articulate, but it can also imply it's an unpleasant or awkward thing to say.

post_false_friends_writeup: While ~にくい, ~がたい, and ~づらい can all translate to "difficult to do," their nuances
  differ. ~にくい describes an inherent, objective difficulty. ~がたい conveys a strong emotional or mental
  barrier, making an action almost impossible to bring oneself to do. ~づらい often implies a personal, subjective
  difficulty, or that the action is unpleasant or painful for the performer. ~かねる expresses the speaker's
  polite hesitation or inability to perform an action, rather than an inherent difficulty of the action
  itself. Choose carefully based on the specific nuance you wish to convey.

    scene: A family having dinner, commenting on the quality of the meal.
    register: casual

    scene: A technician explaining the difficulties of fixing a complex device to a client.

    scene: A student studying for a Japanese test, struggling with a particular kanji.
    register: casual
    setting: academic
    nuance: 「覚えにくい」 indicates that the complexity, irregular strokes, or similar appearance to other kanji
      inherently make the memorization process difficult for learners.
post_example_writeup: The examples demonstrate that ~にくい can apply to a wide range of situations, from
  physical actions like sitting and walking, to cognitive tasks like understanding and remembering, and
  even social interactions like speaking. In each case, it highlights an inherent or situational characteristic
  that makes the verb's action difficult to perform or experience. The speaker's personal feeling is less
  emphasized than the objective nature of the difficulty.
