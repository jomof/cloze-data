    "writeup": "「すこしも〜ない」 translates to \"not even a little bit\" or \"not at all.\" It emphasizes the lack of something, indicating that there is 'no (A),' '(A) never happens,' or 'not (A) at all,' depending on whether a verb or adjective is being negated. 「すこしも」 can come at the beginning of the sentence or directly before the word/statement it modifies. The particle 「も」 here expresses surprise or unexpectedness, highlighting 「少し」.",
