    "etymology": "The grammar point 「すこしも〜ない」 is derived from 「少し」 (sukoshi), meaning 'a little,' combined with the particle 「も」, which here emphasizes the 'even' in 'not even a little.' The 「ない」 part is the negative form, which creates the overall negative meaning.",
    "writeup": "「すこしも〜ない」 translates to \"not even a little bit\" or \"not at all.\" It emphasizes the lack of something, indicating that there is 'no (A),' '(A) never happens,' or 'not (A) at all,' depending on whether a verb or adjective is being negated. 「すこしも」 can come at the beginning of the sentence or directly before the word/statement it modifies. The particle 「も」 here expresses surprise or unexpectedness, highlighting 「少し」.",
