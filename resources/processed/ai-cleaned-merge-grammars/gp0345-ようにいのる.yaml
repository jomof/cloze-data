    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ように祈る」 combines 「よう」, meaning 'way' or 'manner,' with the verb 「祈る(いのる)」, 'to pray.' Thus, it literally means 'to pray in a way that...'. The 「よう」 indicates a desired outcome or state, making the whole phrase express a hope or prayer for a specific result.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ように祈る」 (yō ni inoru) is used to express a wish, hope, or prayer that something will happen. It combines 「よう」 (yō), which derives from the noun 「様」 (sama) meaning 'manner' or 'way,' with the verb 「祈る」 (inoru), meaning \"to pray.\" This construction literally means 'to pray in a way that [something happens]' or 'to pray for [a certain state/outcome].' While it can be used in the context of actual prayer, it frequently expresses a general strong hope or wish, similar to \"keeping one's fingers crossed.\" The negative form, 「ないように祈る」, expresses a prayer or hope for something *not* to happen.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   Unlike other 「ように」 structures, 「ように祈る」 can sometimes be shortened simply to 「ように」, especially after the ます form. This omission of 「祈る」 is common when the context clearly implies a wish or prayer, and it distinguishes it from other 「ように」 structures like 「ようにする」 or 「ようになる」.\n*   This construction differs from 「といい」 or 「ばいい」, which also express wishes or hopes. While 「ように祈る」 explicitly states the act of praying or hoping, 「といい」/「ばいい」 are more direct expressions of a wish, often implying \"it would be good if...\" or \"I hope...\" without the overt action of 'praying.'",
