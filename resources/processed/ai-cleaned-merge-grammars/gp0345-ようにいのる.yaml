        "[Sentence] + ように祈る": "Expresses praying or hoping for a particular outcome."

    "etymology": "The grammar point combines 「ように」(you ni), indicating a manner or purpose, with 「祈る」(inoru), the verb 'to pray.' Together, they create the meaning of praying in such a way that something will happen.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ように祈る」(you ni inoru) expresses praying or hoping for something. 「ように」 indicates the manner or purpose, and 「祈る」 means \"to pray\" or \"to beg.\" It's used when expressing a hope or wish, not only in religious contexts but also in everyday situations. You can also use 「ないように祈る」 to express the hope that something will *not* happen.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   Sometimes, 「ように祈る」 is shortened to just 「ように」, especially after 「ます」. In this case, 「ように」 alone implies \"to hope for\" and should not be confused with other 「ように」 structures like 「ようにする」 or 「ようになる」.\n*   「といい」 also expresses hoping or wishing, but the person being prayed for is indicated by 「ね」 (praying for someone else) or 「な」 (praying for oneself).",
