    "etymology": "The verb 「上がる (agaru)」 means \"to rise\" or \"to go up.\" 「上げる (ageru)」 means \"to raise\" or \"to lift up.\" When attached to the stem of another verb, they carry the nuance of completing the action to its fullest extent, as if the action has \"risen\" to its peak or has been \"lifted\" to completion.",
    "writeup": "When used after the conjunctive (masu-stem) form of a verb, either of the verbs 「上げる (ageru)」 \"to raise,\" or 「上がる (agaru)」 \"to rise\" may be used. They convey that something has been done \"to the limit.\" 「上がる」 is used for actions that take place by themselves (intransitive), while 「上げる」 is used for actions that have an instigator (transitive). Although 「上げる」 and 「上がる」 show that something has been done \"to the limit,\" the nuance is usually \"to do (A) to the point of completion,\" or \"to do (A) through to the end.\" Therefore, the \"limit\" that is highlighted is usually a natural ending, and not due to running out of some kind of resource.\n\nMost commonly, 「上げる」 and 「上がる」 are used when some kind of effect or product is produced as a result of the (A) action. In these cases, the literal meaning of \"to (A) up\" is very similar to \"to finish up (A)\" in English.\n\n**Important Considerations**\nNote that 「仕上がる (shiagaru)」 is a very common expression that is used for many things. Usually, it conveys that something has been completed after some involved or time-consuming process.",

This form is a compound expression using the te-form plus ください, rather than a direct conjugation of the auxiliary verb itself, and thus does not fit the definition of a simple conjugation as per the schema's intent for this field. The original entry in the prior grammar point was a violation of this implicit rule, which is now corrected to reflect a more accurate representation of conjugations for the grammar point."

These new examples are designed to exhibit a wider variety of settings, registers, and conjugations, while strictly adhering to the JLPT N3 kanji list and avoiding literal reproductions from external sources like Bunpro, as explicitly commanded. Each new example includes both transitive ('上げる') and intransitive ('上がる') uses, covers multiple formations, and explores different grammatical contexts to comprehensively illustrate the grammar point's usage and nuance. Also, added 'english_literally', 'scene', 'scene_rationale', 'speaker_gender', 'listener_gender', 'speaker_age', and 'nuance' fields to each example, as required by the schema."
