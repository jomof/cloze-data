    },
    "etymology": "The verb 「上がる (agaru)」 means \"to rise\" or \"to go up.\" 「上げる (ageru)」 means \"to raise\" or \"to lift up.\" When attached to the stem of another verb, they carry the nuance of completing the action to its fullest extent, as if the action has \"risen\" to its peak or has been \"lifted\" to completion.",
    "writeup": "When used after the conjunctive (masu-stem) form of a verb, either of the verbs 「上げる (ageru)」 \"to raise,\" or 「上がる (agaru)」 \"to rise\" may be used. They convey that something has been done \"to the limit.\" 「上がる」 is used for actions that take place by themselves (intransitive), while 「上げる」 is used for actions that have an instigator (transitive). Although 「上げる」 and 「上がる」 show that something has been done \"to the limit,\" the nuance is usually \"to do (A) to the point of completion,\" or \"to do (A) through to the end.\" Therefore, the \"limit\" that is highlighted is usually a natural ending, and not due to running out of some kind of resource.\n\nMost commonly, 「上げる」 and 「上がる」 are used when some kind of effect or product is produced as a result of the (A) action. In these cases, the literal meaning of \"to (A) up\" is very similar to \"to finish up (A)\" in English.\n\n**Important Considerations**\nNote that 「仕上がる (shiagaru)」 is a very common expression that is used for many things. Usually, it conveys that something has been completed after some involved or time-consuming process.",
