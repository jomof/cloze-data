        "Verb (dictionary form) + だけで": "Indicates that just doing something is enough to achieve a certain result or feeling.",

    },
    "etymology": "だけで is formed from だけ (dake), meaning \"only\" or \"just,\" and で (de), a particle indicating means or method. So, literally, it means \"with only.\" The combination emphasizes that something can be achieved or experienced simply by means of the preceding noun or verb.",
    "writeup": "**だけで (dake de)** combines the adverbial particle **だけ (dake)**, meaning \"only,\" and the case-marking particle **で (de)**. It signifies that something is achieved or is sufficient \"just by\" or \"only with\" the preceding noun or verb. It emphasizes that no other action or element is necessary for the specified outcome. Think of it as highlighting a single, sufficient condition.\n\nThis grammar point can attach to the plain form (dictionary form, plain past, plain negative) of verbs, or directly to nouns. The nuance conveyed is often one of simplicity, ease, or a surprisingly minimal requirement.\n\n**だけ (dake)** is distinctive from **しか (shika)** in that **だけ (dake)** suggests there might have been other options, but only the specified one was chosen or required. In contrast, **しか (shika)** implies that there was *only* one option available to begin with.",

            "meaning": "Only; Just",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While both indicate limitation, だけ stands alone and doesn't emphasize the means or method like だけで does. だけで specifies 'by means of only X', whereas だけ simply means 'only X'."

            "term": "だけあって",
            "meaning": "As might be expected; Being the case; Precisely because",
            "kind": "often confused with",
            "nuance": "Unlike だけで, だけあって signifies that something is a natural and expected consequence or result of a preceding condition or quality. It implies 'as one would expect given X', rather than 'only by X'."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that **だけで** emphasizes the *sufficiency* of a single action or condition: 'only by doing X, Y happens'. **だけ** simply limits to one thing: 'only X exists/is relevant'. **だけあって** indicates a *predictable outcome* based on a preceding quality or situation: 'because X, as expected Y'. Pay attention to the context to distinguish between these similar expressions.",
