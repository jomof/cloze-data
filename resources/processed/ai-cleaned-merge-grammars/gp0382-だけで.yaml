    "etymology": "だけで is formed from だけ (dake), meaning \"only\" or \"just,\" and で (de), a particle indicating means or method. So, literally, it means \"with only.\" The combination emphasizes that something can be achieved or experienced simply by means of the preceding noun or verb.",
    "writeup": "**だけで (dake de)** combines the adverbial particle **だけ (dake)**, meaning \"only,\" and the case-marking particle **で (de)**. It signifies that something is achieved or sufficient \"just by\" or \"only with\" the preceding noun or verb. It emphasizes that no other action or element is necessary for the specified outcome. Think of it as highlighting a single sufficient condition. Unlike **しか (shika)**, **だけ (dake)** implies that there were other options available, but only one was chosen or needed.",
