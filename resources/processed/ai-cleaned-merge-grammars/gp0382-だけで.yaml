    "etymology": "だけで is formed from だけ (dake), meaning \"only\" or \"just,\" and で (de), a particle indicating means or method. So, literally, it means \"with only.\" The combination emphasizes that something can be achieved or experienced simply by means of the preceding noun or verb.",
    "writeup": "**だけで (dake de)** combines the adverbial particle **だけ (dake)**, meaning \"only,\" and the case-marking particle **で (de)**. It signifies that something is achieved or is sufficient \"just by\" or \"only with\" the preceding noun or verb. It emphasizes that no other action or element is necessary for the specified outcome. Think of it as highlighting a single, sufficient condition.\n\nThis grammar point can attach to the plain form (dictionary form, plain past, plain negative) of verbs, or directly to nouns. The nuance conveyed is often one of simplicity, ease, or a surprisingly minimal requirement.\n\n**だけ (dake)** is distinctive from **しか (shika)** in that **だけ (dake)** suggests there might have been other options, but only the specified one was chosen or required. In contrast, **しか (shika)** implies that there was *only* one option available to begin with.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To avoid confusion, remember that **だけで** emphasizes the *sufficiency* of a single action or condition: 'only by doing X, Y happens'. **だけ** simply limits to one thing: 'only X exists/is relevant'. **だけあって** indicates a *predictable outcome* based on a preceding quality or situation: 'because X, as expected Y'.
