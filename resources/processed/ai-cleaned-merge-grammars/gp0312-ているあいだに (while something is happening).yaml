pronunciation:
  katakana: テイルアイダニ

formation:
  Verb[ている] + あいだに: Indicates that something happens within the timeframe of an ongoing action.
jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: semi-formal
  usage-context: general
etymology: 「あいだ」 (間) means "interval" or "space". When used with 「ている」 form, it highlights the ongoing
  event as the 'whole' span of time, within which another event happens at some point.
writeup: 「ているあいだに」 indicates that event (B) happens within the timeframe of ongoing action (A). The (B)
  action must occur somewhere within the duration of (A). There does not need to be any specific causal
  connection between the actions. It often describes actions that are beyond the speaker's direct control,
  though this is not always the case. 「間」 literally means an "interval", which highlights the (A) event
  as being the 'whole' span of time, within which (B) happened or will happen at some point. This construction
  translates naturally as "during the time that (A), (B)".

      and the subjects of the two actions can be different.
    grammar_point: ながら (while doing)
  - term: うちに
    meaning: While, During
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「うちに」 often emphasizes taking advantage of a limited time frame or that a change occurs naturally
      within a certain period. 「ているあいだに」 simply states that something happens during the course of an
      ongoing action, without the sense of urgency or natural change.
    grammar_point: うちに (while・before change)
  - term: ところに・ところへ
    meaning: At the time, When, While, Timing

    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「とき」 is a general temporal conjunction meaning "when" or "at the time of," covering a wide

      of another action.
    grammar_point: とき (when)
  - term: の間に
    meaning: While, During, Between, Period
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「の間に」 is used with nouns to indicate a period or interval during which something occurs (e.g.,

      focusing on the continuous state of an action.

    meaning: During, While, Throughout, In the process of
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「〜中」 can mean "during" or "in the middle of" an event or period, similar to 「ているあいだに」. However,
      「中」 can also imply being physically inside something (e.g., 「会議中」 'during a meeting' or 'in the
      middle of a meeting'), while 「ているあいだに」 is strictly about temporal overlap.
    grammar_point: 中 (duration・entirety)
  - term: ついでに
    meaning: While you are at it, On the occasion
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ついでに」 implies performing an additional, usually minor, action conveniently while already
      doing something else. 「ているあいだに」 simply describes one event occurring during the duration of another,
      without the connotation of seizing an opportunity.
    grammar_point: ついでに (taking the opportunity)
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share a similar meaning of 'while' or 'during', they
  each carry distinct nuances in usage and context. Pay close attention to the specific type of action
  or timeframe being described, and whether there's an implication of simultaneity, a specific moment,
  or seizing an opportunity, to choose the most appropriate expression.

  point within the *duration* of the first, ongoing action. This is distinct from 「とき」, which merely marks
  a point in time or a general period. The choice between these two expressions often depends on whether
  the emphasis is on an ongoing process or a specific moment.
