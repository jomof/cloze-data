    "etymology": "「結果 (kekka)」 literally means \"result\" or \"outcome.\" This grammar point uses this noun to indicate a cause-and-effect relationship, where something happens 「の結果」 of a preceding action or situation.",
    "writeup": "「結果 (kekka)」 meaning \"result,\" is used to express that one event is the direct consequence of another. It's similar to saying \"as a result of (A), (B)\" in English. You'll often see it connected to verbs in the past tense or nouns followed by の. Unlike あげく, which usually implies a negative outcome, 結果 can be used for both positive and negative results. It simply highlights the cause of the outcome.",
