    "writeup": "「結果 (kekka)」, meaning \"result,\" is used to express that one event is the direct consequence of another. It is similar to saying \"as a result of (A), (B)\" in English. You will often see it connected to verbs in the past tense or nouns followed by の. Unlike 「あげく」, which usually implies a negative outcome, 「結果」 can be used for both positive and negative results. It simply highlights the cause of the outcome and the final conclusion reached.",
