    "etymology": "「結果 (kekka)」 literally means \"result\" or \"outcome.\" This grammar point uses this noun to indicate a cause-and-effect relationship, where something happens 「の結果」 of a preceding action or situation.",
    "writeup": "「結果 (kekka)」, meaning \"result,\" is used to express that one event is the direct consequence of another. It is similar to saying \"as a result of (A), (B)\" in English. You will often see it connected to verbs in the past tense or nouns followed by の. Unlike 「あげく」, which usually implies a negative outcome, 「結果」 can be used for both positive and negative results. It simply highlights the cause of the outcome and the final conclusion reached.",

Similarly, while 「〜ため」 and 「〜によって」 can express cause or reason, 「結果」 specifically emphasizes the final product or outcome of a preceding event or action.",
