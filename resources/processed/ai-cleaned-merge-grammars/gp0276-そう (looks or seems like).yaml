jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary adjective
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Used to convey impressions based on direct sensory information or immediate observation.
  nuance: This specific 「そう」 focuses purely on direct observation and impression.
  counterpoint: Be mindful of the context to differentiate 「そう」 meaning "it seems" from other uses of
    「そう」, such as the 「伝聞・様態のそう」 which indicates hearsay (e.g., 「～だそうだ」 meaning "I hear that...") or describes
    the manner of an action (e.g., 「～ように」 meaning "as if...").
etymology: The grammar point 「そう」 originates from a contraction of 「様 (さま)」 (form, appearance) and the
  classical auxiliary verb 「なり」 (meaning 'to be' or 'to become'). Thus, 「様なり」 evolved into 「そう」, signifying
  something "is like an appearance" or "takes on a certain form/look." This root explains its function
  in describing impressions based on direct observation.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「そうに・そうな」 expresses that something "seems like" or "looks like" something else. It is used to convey impressions based on direct sensory information, such as visual observation or auditory perception. It implies a judgment or inference based on outward appearance.

  *   「そうに」 functions as an adverb, modifying verbs or adjectives. It describes the manner in which an action is performed or a state exists, based on its appearance.
  *   「そうな」 functions as an adjectival noun (な-adjective), modifying nouns. It describes a noun by its apparent state or quality.

  **Important Considerations**

  *   When using 「そう」 with negative verb forms, remove the 「い」 from the plain negative 「ない」 and attach 「そう」. For example, 「する」 (to do) becomes 「しなさそう」 (doesn't look like it will do), not 「しなそう」.
  *   Similarly, for negative い-adjectives, the 「い」 from 「ない」 is removed and 「さ」 is added before attaching 「そう」, resulting in 「なさそう」. For example, 「おいしい」 (delicious) becomes 「おいしくなさそう」 (doesn't look delicious).

  - term: げ
    meaning: Seemingly, Giving appearance of, [Expresses emotions or feelings]
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「げ」 directly expresses a person's internal feelings that are evident externally, like 'sad-looking'
      (悲しげ), while 「そうに/そうな」 describes a general appearance or impression of a state or action, not limited
      to emotions (e.g., 'looks tasty' (美味しそう)).
    grammar_point: げ (seeming・appearance)
  - term: ように・ような
    meaning: As・like, Just like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ように/ような」 indicates a direct comparison or resemblance (e.g., 'like a dream' (夢のように)), while
      「そうに/そうな」 suggests an indirect impression or appearance based on observation (e.g., 'looks like
      it's going to rain' (雨が降りそう)).
    grammar_point: ように・ような (like・as・similar to)
  - term: ようだ
    meaning: It seems that, It appears that, It looks like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ようだ」 expresses a judgment or conclusion based on indirect evidence or inference (e.g., 'It
      seems he's tired' (疲れているようだ)), while 「そうに/そうな」 is based on a more direct sensory impression, often
      visual (e.g., 'He looks tired' (疲れてそう)).
    grammar_point: ようだ (it seems)
  - term: みたい
    meaning: Like, similar to, resembling; seems like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「みたい」 implies a casual comparison based on shared characteristics (e.g., 'like a child' (子供みたい)),
      while 「そうに/そうな」 conveys a more subtle or nuanced impression of an observed state or likelihood.
    grammar_point: みたい (appears・resembles)
  - term: 見える
    meaning: To be visible, to seem, to be in sight.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「見える」 is a potential verb indicating what is visually perceptible (e.g., 'Mount Fuji is visible'
      (富士山が見える)), while 「そうに/そうな」 describes the manner or quality of that appearance, or what is likely
      to happen based on appearance (e.g., 'It looks good' (美味しそうに見える)).
    grammar_point: 見える (to be visible・to seem)
  - term: らしい
    meaning: Indicates hearsay, conjecture, or something that seems to be the case based on available
      information.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「らしい」 suggests an impression or conclusion based on indirect evidence or hearsay (e.g., 'I
      heard it's good' (良いらしい)), whereas 「そうに/そうな」 expresses an impression derived from direct sensory
      observation (e.g., 'It looks good' (良さそう)).
    grammar_point: らしい (I hear, it seems)
post_false_friends_writeup: While these expressions share similarities with 「そうに・そうな」, they each carry
  unique nuances. 「ように」 and 「みたい」 imply a more direct comparison or resemblance, whereas 「そうに・そうな」 suggests
  a subjective impression based on immediate sensory input. 「見える」 focuses on visual perception, while
  「そうに・そうな」 describes the quality or manner of that appearance, or a prediction based on appearance. 「らしい」
  conveys information based on hearsay or indirect evidence, unlike 「そうに・そうな」 which stems from direct
  observation. Using these expressions correctly requires careful attention to the specific context and
  desired nuance.

      of observable readiness.

    scene: Two friends are shopping for clothes.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    nuance: 「高くなさそうな」 describes the dress's appearance as not seeming expensive. 「高い」 (expensive) loses
      its 「い」, takes 「く」, then 「ない」 becomes 「なさそうな」, modifying 「感じ」. This conveys a visual impression
      of being inexpensive.
post_example_writeup: These examples demonstrate how 「そうに・そうな」 functions by conveying an impression or
  appearance rather than a definitive statement. The context, such as visual cues or observed behavior,
  is crucial for understanding its usage. Remember that 「そうに」 modifies verbs or adjectives, describing
  the *manner* of an action or state, while 「そうな」 modifies nouns, describing the *apparent quality* of
  a noun. Pay close attention to the distinction between direct facts and observed impressions to choose
  the correct expression.
