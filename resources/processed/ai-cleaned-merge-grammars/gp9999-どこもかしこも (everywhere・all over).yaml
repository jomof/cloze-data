pronunciation:

formation:
  どこもかしこも + [Situation/State/Verb]: Used to describe a scene or situation where something is present or
    happening in all places, emphasizing its pervasiveness or thoroughness.
jlpt: N2
etymology: The phrase 'どこもかしこも' is a combination of two spatial interrogative/demonstrative words, 'どこ'
  (where) and 'かしこ' (an archaic demonstrative pronoun meaning 'that place yonder' or 'over there'), each
  followed by the inclusive particle 'も' (also, too, even). The repetition and combination with 'も' creates
  an emphatic sense of 'even here, and even there, and everywhere in between,' leading to the meaning
  of 'all over' or 'everywhere.' 'かしこ' is rarely used independently in modern Japanese outside of fixed
  phrases like this.
writeup: |-
  The phrase 'どこもかしこも' is used to describe a situation where something is present or happening **everywhere**, covering all places or aspects thoroughly. It conveys a sense of pervasiveness, indicating that there is no place or part unaffected by the described state or object.

  This expression is typically used to paint a vivid picture of a scene or condition. For instance, if a house is messy, you might say '物が{どこもかしこも}散らかっている' (things are scattered everywhere). It emphasizes the completeness of the widespread phenomenon.

  While 'どこもかしこも' can be used neutrally, it often carries a nuance of something being overwhelming, thorough, or even slightly negative, particularly when describing undesirable situations like dirt, crowds, or problems. However, it can also be used for positive or neutral widespread phenomena, such as '桜が{どこもかしこも}咲いている' (cherry blossoms are blooming everywhere).

  It functions as an adverbial phrase, modifying verbs or adjectives, and typically precedes the element it describes, or is placed at the beginning of a clause to set the scene.

  - term: どこでも
    meaning: Anywhere; everywhere (possible/allowed)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '''どこでも'' emphasizes **possibility** or **universality of choice or location**, meaning ''any
      place is fine'' or ''it is possible to do something in any place.'' In contrast, ''どこもかしこも'' emphasizes
      **actual widespread presence** or thoroughness, meaning something *is* present in every single place.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:どこでも (anywhere・everywhere)
  - term: あちこち
    meaning: Here and there; all over (scattered)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '''あちこち'' implies movement or scattered presence in various, often specific, places. It suggests
      a less systematic or less complete ''everywhere,'' more like ''bits and pieces here and there.''
      ''どこもかしこも'' suggests a more pervasive, thorough, or even overwhelming presence covering an entire
      area, implying that nearly *no* place is untouched.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:あちこち (here and there・all over)
  - term: 至る所
    meaning: Everywhere; all places (reaching every place)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: '''至る所'' (いたるところ) is quite similar in meaning to ''どこもかしこも'' in denoting widespread presence,
      but it is generally **more formal or literary** in tone. ''どこもかしこも'' is more colloquial and can
      carry a stronger emotional or vivid connotation of thoroughness or being overwhelmed, while ''至る所''
      is a more neutral and direct statement of universal presence.'
    grammar_point: <suggest>:至る所 (everywhere・all places)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between 'どこもかしこも' and similar expressions, consider the
  degree of pervasiveness and formality. 'どこもかしこも' paints a vivid picture of something covering *every
  single spot*, often with an emotional undertone of thoroughness or being overwhelmed. 'どこでも' focuses
  on *possibility* or *choice*—anywhere is fine. 'あちこち' implies a *scattered* presence in various, less
  comprehensive locations. Lastly, '至る所' conveys a similar widespread presence as 'どこもかしこも' but in a more
  *formal* or *objective* manner. Choose 'どこもかしこも' when you want to emphasize a complete, often vivid,
  coverage of an area.
