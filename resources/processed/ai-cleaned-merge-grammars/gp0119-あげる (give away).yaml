jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Used when giving to someone of equal or lower status, or someone outside one's in-group.
    Not for giving to the speaker or their in-group.
  function: Indicates the transfer of an item or information from the giver's perspective, directed away
    from the giver.
  nuance: While often translated as 'to give', it carries a nuance of 'giving away' or 'offering up',
    emphasizing the direction of the action from the giver to the receiver, particularly when the receiver
    is not part of the speaker's immediate circle or in-group.
etymology: The verb 「あげる」 originally meant "to raise" or "to lift up". This meaning is reflected in the
  kanji 「上げる」. The 'giving' meaning is derived from the idea of 'offering up' something to someone else,
  hence the sense of transfer 'away' from the giver. Though it is often written in hiragana 「あげる」 when
  used in the sense of giving, its root meaning is closely tied to elevation.
writeup: |-
  「あげる」 is a versatile verb in Japanese, but in the context of giving, it specifically refers to the act of giving something away from oneself to someone else. It implies that the item or information is being transferred from the giver's perspective, directed outwards.

  To construct a sentence with 「あげる」, the giver is marked with the particles 「は」 or 「が」, the recipient is marked with 「に」, and the object being given is marked with 「を」. The arrangement of these elements can vary, but the particles remain crucial for indicating their grammatical roles. For instance, 「私 は 友達 に 本 を あげた」 (I gave a book to my friend) clearly demonstrates the flow from the giver to the recipient.

  **Important Considerations:**

  *   **Perspective:** 「あげる」 is used when the act of giving is seen from the giver's viewpoint or from a neutral third-person perspective. It is not used when something is given *to* the speaker or someone within their close in-group.
  *   **Status:** It is generally appropriate to use 「あげる」 when giving to someone of equal or lower status, or to animals. When giving to someone of higher status, such as a teacher or superior, honorific language (like 「差し上げる」 (さしあげる)) or humble speech is typically employed instead.
  *   **Casual vs. Polite:** While 「あげる」 can be used in casual contexts (e.g., in its plain form), its polite form 「あげます」 is quite common. Though the 'register' is often considered 'polite' (丁寧語), its pervasive use in daily interactions makes it feel 'standard' rather than strictly 'formal' in many contexts. While やる is technically the more casual equivalent of あげる, やる can sound rough or informal, particularly when referring to people. Because of this, あげる has become the widely accepted and more natural standard for expressing 'to give' in general conversations, even in casual settings.
false_friends:
  - term: もらう
    meaning: To receive, To get, To obtain
    kind: antonym
    nuance: Unlike 「あげる」, which focuses on the giver's action of giving away, 「もらう」 focuses on the recipient's
      perspective and describes the act of receiving something.
    grammar_point: もらう (to receive)
  - term: てあげる
    meaning: To do something for someone, As a favor for
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「てあげる」 indicates performing an action for someone as a favor, often implying that the action
      benefits the recipient. In contrast, 「あげる」 specifically refers to the act of giving an object or
      information.
    grammar_point: てあげる (to do for someone)
  - term: くれる
    meaning: To give (to me or my in-group)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「くれる」 is used when someone gives something to the speaker or to someone within the speaker's
      close in-group (e.g., family). 「あげる」 is used when the giver gives something away from their perspective,
      typically to someone outside their in-group, or when the speaker is the giver.
    grammar_point: 呉れる・くれる (do something for someone)
  - term: やる
    meaning: To give (to animals, plants, or people of lower status; can be condescending for people)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While also meaning 'to give', 「やる」 carries a nuance of being informal, or giving to someone
      of clearly lower status (e.g., animals, younger children in some contexts), or can even be condescending
      when used for adults. 「あげる」 is generally more neutral and polite.
    grammar_point: やる (do・give・send・show resolve)
  - term: 差し上げる
    meaning: To give (humble form)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「差し上げる」 is the humble form of 「あげる」, used to show respect to the recipient. It implies an
      action done for a superior or honored person. 「あげる」 is a more general or neutral verb used for equals
      or inferiors.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:差し上げる (humble give)
post_false_friends_writeup: Distinguishing between 「あげる」, 「もらう」, 「くれる」, 「やる」, and 「差し上げる」 is fundamental
  for accurate communication in Japanese. The key lies in understanding the **direction of the action**
  and the **speaker's perspective** relative to the giver and receiver. 「あげる」 is about giving away from
  oneself, 「もらう」 is about receiving towards oneself, and 「くれる」 is about someone giving towards oneself
  or one's in-group. 「やる」 is a casual or condescending form of giving, while 「差し上げる」 is the humble form,
  used to show respect. Mastering these distinctions will significantly improve your naturalness in Japanese.

  - english: I'll give my friend some sweets.
    japanese:
      - 友達 に お 菓子 を {あげる}
      - 友達 に お 菓子 を {あげ ます}
      - 友達 に お 菓子 {あげる} ね
      - 友達 に お 菓子 を {あげよ う} と 思っ て いる
      - 友達 に お 菓子 を {あげ ちゃ う}
      - 友達 に お 菓子 {あげよ}
    english_literally: To friend, sweets, I will give.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 友達 が お 菓子 を {くれる}
        english: My friend gives me sweets.
        hint: 「くれる」 implies the sweets are given *to* the speaker or their in-group. We're looking for
          the speaker *giving* sweets.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 友達 に お 菓子 を {やる}
        english: I'll give my friend some sweets (more casual, potentially condescending).
        hint: 「やる」 is a more casual or informal equivalent of あげる, but can sound less polite, especially
          when giving to people. We're looking for a general, friendly 'give'.
    scene: You are preparing a snack and decide to share it with a friend who is sitting nearby.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The use of the plain form 「あげる」 is common in casual conversation among friends. Adding 「ね」
      at the end, as in 「あげるね」, softens the statement and seeks implicit agreement, a nuance often used
      by female speakers. The polite form 「あげます」 is also natural here for a slightly more formal but still
      friendly tone.
  - english: I will ask the teacher a question.
    japanese:
      - 先生 に 質問 を {あげ ます}
      - 先生 に 質問 を {あげる}
      - 先生 に 質問 を {差し上げ ます}
      - 先生 に 質問 {あげよ う} か な
      - 先生 に 質問 を {あげ ませ ん} か
      - 先生 に 質問 {あげよ}
    english_literally: To teacher, question, I will give.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 が 質問 を {くれ ます}
        english: The teacher gives me a question.
        hint: 「くれます」 implies the teacher is giving something *to* the speaker. We're looking for the speaker
          *giving* a question to the teacher.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 先生 に {質問 し ます}
        english: I will ask the teacher a question.
        hint: 「質問します」 is the direct and common way to say 'ask a question'. While あげる is also correct
          here, it implies 'offering' a question. We're looking for the action of 'asking'.
    scene: A student is speaking to another student about their plan to ask a question to their teacher
      after class.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: academic
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: Using 「あげます」 for 'giving a question' is a polite way of saying 'asking a question', especially
      when speaking to a teacher. The polite form 「あげます」 reflects respect for the teacher's status. The
      humble form 「差し上げます」 is even more respectful and common in formal settings, while the plain form
      「あげる」 could be used when speaking casually to a peer about the teacher.
  - english: I gave my younger sister a new game.
    japanese:
      - 妹 に 新しい ゲーム を {あげ た}

      - 妹 に 新しい ゲーム を {あげ た} よ

          - 妹 が 新しい ゲーム を {くれ た}
        english: My younger sister gave me a new game.
        hint: 「くれた」 implies the sister is giving *to* the speaker. We're looking for the speaker *giving*
          to the sister.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 妹 に 新しい ゲーム を {やっ た}
        english: I gave my younger sister a new game (more casual/less polite).
        hint: 「やる」 is a more casual verb for giving, often used for animals or people of lower status.
          While technically possible, あげる is generally more neutral and widely accepted even in casual
          contexts.
    scene: A young man is talking to his older brother about a present he gave to their younger sister
      for her birthday.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The plain past form 「あげた」 is typical for casual conversations among family members or close
      friends. A younger male speaker might use this with an older brother. The polite form 「あげました」 could
      also be used to show a subtle degree of formality or carefulness. While 「やってあげた」 is also casual,
      it can carry a nuance of condescension or doing a favor, which might not always be intended.
  - english: I won't give her any more presents.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 に は もう プレゼント を {あげ ない}
      - 彼女 に は もう プレゼント を {あげ ませ ん}

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 に は もう プレゼント を {くれ ない}
        english: She won't give me any more presents.
        hint: 「くれない」 means 'someone won't give to me'. We're looking for the speaker's refusal to give.
      - competing_japanese:
          - もう プレゼント を {渡さ ない}
        english: I won't hand over presents anymore.
        hint: 「渡す」 is a neutral verb meaning "to hand over" or "to pass," without the directionality implied
          by あげる. We're looking for the act of *giving* away.
    scene: A man is expressing his frustration to a friend about a recent breakup, stating his decision
      not to give his ex-girlfriend any more gifts.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The direct negative 「あげない」 conveys a firm decision, common in casual, yet serious, discussions
      about personal matters. The use of 「彼女 に は」 highlights the recipient of the refusal. The polite
      form 「あげません」 can be used for a slightly less blunt refusal. For male speakers, 「あげねぇ」 is a highly
      casual, somewhat rough, and emphatic masculine negative form.
  - english: Let's give money to people in need.
    japanese:

        english: Let's receive money from people in need.
        hint: 「もらいましょう」 means 'let's receive'. We're looking for 'let's give'.
    scene: A group of volunteers is discussing fundraising ideas, and one proposes direct financial aid.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: persuasive
    conjugation: volitional polite (～ましょう)
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The 「〜ましょう」 ending adds a polite suggestion for collective action. This phrasing is suitable
      for addressing a group, encouraging them to perform an act of charity. The plain volitional 「あげよう」
      would be used in a more casual setting among close peers, conveying a similar 'let's do this' sentiment
      but with less formality.
  - english: When I finish reading this book, you can have it.
    japanese:
      - この 本 を 読み 終わっ たら、あなた に {あげ て} も いい です よ

      - この 本 を 読み 終わっ たら、あなた に {あげよ う} か
      - この 本 を 読み 終わっ たら、あなた に {あげ ます}
      - この 本 読み 終わっ たら、君 に {あげよ う}

          - この 本 を 読み 終わっ たら、あなた が {もらっ て} も いい です よ
        english: When I finish reading this book, you can receive it.
        hint: The phrase 「あげて も いい です よ」 focuses on the speaker's permission to give the book away, not
          the listener's action of receiving.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 本 を 読み 終わっ たら、あなた が 持っ {て 行っ て} も いい です よ
        english: When I finish reading this book, you can take it.
        hint: This suggests taking rather than having something given to you. We're looking for an example
          that specifically uses あげる.
    scene: You're discussing a book with a colleague and offer to give it to them once you've finished
      reading it.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    nuance: The combination of the te-form with 「～もいいです」 indicates permission. The use of 「あなた に」 and
      the polite 「です よ」 makes the offer friendly and clear, emphasizing the speaker's act of giving. The
      more casual 「～もいい よ」 can be used with close friends or colleagues where a slightly less formal tone
      is acceptable, while still conveying the same permission.
  - english: If you have anything you don't need, how about giving it to someone?

        english: If you have unnecessary things, how about someone giving it to you?
        hint: The suggestion is for the child to initiate the giving action, not for someone to give something
          to the child.
      - competing_japanese:
          - もし 不要 な もの が あれ ば、誰 か に {売っ たら} どう です か
        english: If you have anything you don't need, how about selling it to someone?
        hint: This suggests selling rather than giving. We're looking for an example that specifically
          asks about giving.
    scene: A mother is advising her child to declutter their room and suggests donating unused items.
    register: casual
    setting: instructional
    conjugation: conditional (～たら)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The conditional 「あげたら どう です か」 is a common way to offer a suggestion. The casual tone and
      direct addressing of the child are typical of a mother's advice. 「あげたら いかが です か」 offers a more formal
      and polite phrasing of the same suggestion, suitable for a more distant relationship or formal context.
      「あげたら どう？」 is an even more casual variant, common among close family or friends.
  - english: I intend to give her a wristwatch.
    japanese:
      - 私 は 彼女 に 腕 時計 を {あげる} つもり だ
      - 私 は 彼女 に 腕 時計 を {あげる} つもり です
      - 彼女 に 腕 時計 を {あげる} つもり だ
      - 彼女 に 腕 時計 を {あげよ う} と 思っ て いる

          - 私 は 彼女 に 腕 時計 を {くれる} つもり だ
        english: I intend for her to give me a wristwatch.
        hint: 「くれる」 implies she is giving something *to* the speaker. We're looking for the speaker giving
          something *to* her.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 彼女 に 腕 時計 を {もらう} つもり だ
        english: I intend to receive a wristwatch from her.
        hint: 「もらう」 implies receiving. We're looking for an intention to give.
    scene: A man is secretly planning a surprise gift for his girlfriend and confiding in a close friend.
    register: casual
    setting: intimate
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「～つもり だ」 expresses intention. The casual 「あげる」 paired with this is appropriate
      for a man speaking candidly to a close friend about a personal plan. The polite form 「～つもり です」 maintains
      the intention but with increased formality. Omitting 「私 は」 is very common in natural Japanese when
      the subject is clear from context, making 「彼女 に 腕時計 を あげる つもり だ」 also a natural choice in a casual
      setting.
  - english: I will give a presentation on the new marketing strategy to the department head.

          or 'submitting' implied by あげる for intangible things like presentations.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 部 長 が 新しい マーケティング 戦略 の 発表 を {くれ ます}
        english: The department head gives a presentation on the new marketing strategy to me.

    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of 「あげます」 here, particularly for a presentation (発表) to a superior (部長), conveys the
      act of offering or submitting. It implies a sense of delivering something to a higher authority,
      which is a common usage of 「あげる」 in formal or business contexts, unlike simply 「説明します」 (explain)
      which lacks this directional nuance of offering.

        hint: 「もらっている」 means 'is receiving'. We are looking for the mother's action of *giving*.
    scene: Describing a mother's dedication to her child's well-being.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    conjugation: progressive (～ている)
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: 「あげる」 can be used for abstract "gifts" like 「配慮」 (考慮) or 「愛情」 (愛情). The progressive form 「あげている」
      emphasizes the ongoing nature of the mother's care. This usage highlights the broad applicability
      of 「あげる」 beyond physical objects, extending to intangible contributions.

      - competing_japanese:

        english: I will send you to the station.
        hint: 「送ります」 is a neutral verb meaning 'to send' or 'to escort'. Adding 「あげられます」 implies doing
          it as a favor or benefit to the other person, which is the nuance we're aiming for.
    scene: A colleague offers to drive another colleague to the station after work.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: potential (～られる/～える)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The potential form 「あげられます」 (can give/do for) is used here to politely offer a service or
      favor. The phrase 「送ってあげる」 (to send [someone] as a favor) combined with the potential means 'can
      offer to send'. This shows thoughtfulness and willingness to assist.

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 率直 な 意見 を {言っ て} ください
        english: Please say your honest opinion.
        hint: 「言ってください」 is a common way to ask someone to state their opinion. However, 「あげて」 in this
          context implies 'offering' or 'providing' the opinion, suggesting a valuable contribution rather
          than simply stating it.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 率直 な 意見 を {聞か せ て} ください
        english: Please let me hear your honest opinion.
        hint: 「聞かせてください」 means 'please let me hear'. We are looking for a direct request for them to 'give'
          their opinion.
    scene: A project leader is asking team members for their feedback during a brainstorming session.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: te-form (～て)
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: Using 「あげて ください」 for 'giving an opinion' is a more indirect and polite way than simply 「言って
      ください」 (please say). It frames the opinion as something valuable being offered or provided, which
      is appropriate in a professional setting when seeking input. The use of 「ください」 makes it a direct,
      polite request.
post_example_writeup: Distinguishing between 「あげる」, 「もらう」, 「くれる」, 「やる」, and 「差し上げる」 is fundamental for
  accurate communication in Japanese. The key lies in understanding the **direction of the action** and
  the **speaker's perspective** relative to the giver and receiver. 「あげる」 is about giving away from oneself,
  「もらう」 is about receiving towards oneself, and 「くれる」 is about someone giving towards oneself or one's
  in-group. 「やる」 is a casual or condescending form of giving, while 「差し上げる」 is the humble form, used to
  show respect. Mastering these distinctions will significantly improve your naturalness in Japanese.
