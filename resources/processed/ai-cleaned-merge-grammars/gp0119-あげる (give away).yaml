    "etymology": "The verb 「あげる」 originally meant \"to raise\" or \"to lift up\". The 'giving' meaning is derived from the idea of 'offering up' something to someone else. Note that the kanji for 「上げる」 is different than the hiragana used here.",
    "writeup": "「あげる」 is a verb with multiple meanings, but in the context of giving, it indicates that someone is giving something to someone else. The giver is marked with 「は」 or 「が」, the recipient with 「に」, and the object with 「を」. The order of these elements doesn't matter as long as the particles are correct. For example, 「私は弟に飲み物をあげた」 means \"I gave my younger brother a drink.\" The word あげる indicates the drink is being given away from the speaker to someone outside their immediate circle.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   「あげる」 is generally used when giving to someone of equal or lower status. When giving to someone of higher status, use honorific language.\n*   While considered polite, 「あげる」 is the most natural way to say \"to give.\" 「やる」 is a more casual equivalent, but can sound rough.",
