    "etymology": "The verb 「あげる」 originally meant \"to raise\" or \"to lift up.\" The nuance of offering something \"up\" to someone evolved into the meaning of \"to give\" as an act of bestowing something upon another. This is related to the polite connotation of the word.",
    "writeup": "「あげる」 is a versatile verb in Japanese, primarily meaning \"to give.\" While its original sense is \"to raise,\" it functions as a polite way to express giving something to someone. Think of it as similar to \"offering up\" something in English. It's important to note that with 「あげる」, the recipient is marked with the particle 「に」.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **Politeness Level:** Although 「あげる」 is considered polite, it's the most natural way to say \"to give\" in many situations. However, avoid using 「あげる」 when giving something to someone of higher status. Honorific language and humble speech require different verbs.\n*   **Casual Equivalent:** 「やる」 is the casual equivalent of 「あげる」, but it can sound a bit rough. 「あげる」 is generally the safer and more common choice.",
