        "nuance": "「を通じて」 emphasizes the passage through a medium or period, often for information or continuous states. 「を通して」 implies a more active or intentional use of a channel or experience to achieve a result. While often interchangeable, consider the subtle difference in the nature of the 'through' relationship: passive conduit versus active means."
    },
    "etymology": "「通じて」 comes from the intransitive verb 「通じる」(tsūjiru), meaning 'to pass through' or 'to be understood.' 「通して」 comes from the transitive verb 「通す」(toosu), meaning 'to let pass' or 'to allow through.' The particle 「を」 indicates the object or means by which something is achieved or experienced. Both forms express the concept of something extending or being conveyed via an intermediate medium or duration.",
    "writeup": "「を通じて」 and 「を通して」 are two Japanese grammar patterns that are remarkably similar in meaning and are frequently used interchangeably. Both primarily convey the sense of \"through (A)\" or \"via (A)\" to achieve (B). This \"through\" can refer to a method, a medium, or a physical passage.\n\nDespite their significant overlap, their nuances stem from their root verbs: 「通じる」 (tsūjiru) is intransitive, meaning 'to flow' or 'to go through,' while 「通す」 (tōsu) is transitive, meaning 'to let pass' or 'to allow through.'\n\nConsequently, **「を通じて」** is more commonly used when referring to information, communication, or abstract connections where (A) acts as a passive conduit or the medium through which (B) naturally occurs. It also frequently expresses continuation **\"throughout\"** a period or area.\n\nIn contrast, **「を通して」** tends to imply a more active, intentional, or direct pathway. It is often preferred when (A) is an active agent or a concrete channel through which something is deliberately transferred or relocated. This pattern can also refer to a holistic experience or process serving as a means to an end.\n\nBoth expressions are always preceded by a noun followed by the particle 「を」, indicating the noun as the 'path' or 'medium' for the action or state that follows.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While both indicate means, 「によって」 often specifies the direct cause, agent, or method of an action, whereas 「を通じて」/「を通して」 implies an intermediate medium or channel. 「によって」 can also mean 'according to' or 'depending on', meanings not shared by 「を通じて」/「を通して」."

            "nuance": "「で」 is a broad particle indicating means, location, or cause. While it can overlap with some uses of 「を通じて」/「を通して」 (e.g., means), it does not carry the same nuance of 'through' a medium or 'throughout' a period in the same specific way."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When choosing between these expressions, consider the nature of the relationship between the noun and the action. If you want to emphasize the noun as a *channel* or *medium* through which something passes or is achieved, or a duration *throughout* which something occurs, 「を通じて」 or 「を通して」 are the appropriate choices. If the noun is the direct *agent*, *cause*, or *method*, 「によって」 is generally more suitable. If the noun is simply the *tool* or *location* where something happens, 「で」 is often sufficient. While there is overlap, 「を通じて」 and 「を通して」 uniquely convey the sense of 'going through' something, whether literally or figuratively.",
