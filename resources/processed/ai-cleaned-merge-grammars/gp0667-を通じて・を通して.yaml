    "writeup": "「を通じて」 and 「を通して」 are two Japanese grammar patterns with highly similar meanings, often used interchangeably. They primarily convey the sense of \"through (A)\" or \"via (A)\" to achieve (B). This 'through' can refer to a method, a medium, or a physical passage.\n\nWhile largely interchangeable, their nuances stem from their root verbs: 「通じる」 (tsūjiru) is intransitive, meaning 'to flow' or 'to go through', and 「通す」 (tōsu) is transitive, meaning 'to let pass' or 'to allow through'.\n\nConsequently, **「を通じて」** is more frequently used when referring to information, communication, or abstract connections where (A) acts as a passive conduit or the medium through which (B) naturally occurs. It also commonly expresses continuation **\"throughout\"** a period or area.\n\nIn contrast, **「を通して」** tends to imply a more active, intentional, or direct pathway. It is often preferred when (A) is an active agent or a concrete channel through which something is deliberately transferred or relocated. This pattern can also refer to a holistic experience or process serving as a means to an end.\n\nBoth expressions are preceded by a noun followed by the particle 「を」, indicating the noun as the 'path' or 'medium'. The choice between them often depends on the speaker's nuance of intent and the nature of the 'through' relationship.",
    "etymology": "「通じて」 comes from the verb 「通じる」(tsūjiru), meaning 'to pass through' or 'to understand each other.' 「通して」 comes from the verb 「通す」(toosu), meaning 'to let pass' or 'to allow.' The particle 「を」 indicates the object or means by which something is achieved or experienced.",
