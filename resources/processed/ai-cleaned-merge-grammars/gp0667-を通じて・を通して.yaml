    "writeup": "「を通じて」 and 「を通して」 are two grammar patterns in Japanese that have very similar meanings and are used in many overlapping situations. Primarily, they can be thought of as meaning \"through (A), (B)\" or \"via (A), (B).\" This \"through\" may indicate a method or a location.\n\n「通じる」 means \"to flow\" or \"to go through,\" and 「通す」 means \"to make a path.\" They differ in that the former is intransitive, while the latter is transitive. Because of this, 「通じる」 is more often used regarding information or communication where (A) is the connection through which (B) occurs.\n\n「通す」, on the other hand, more often refers to direct locations through which something is transferred or relocated. As this expression begins with 「を」, it will appear after nouns, before expressing in the (B) part of the sentence exactly what was done \"through\" (A).\n\nThe primary difference between 「を通じて」 and 「を通して」 lies in the intransitive and transitive nature of the verbs themselves. Due to this, things that are done \"intentionally\" or \"by use of (A)\" tend to use 「を通して」. 「を通じて」 is more common when something is being done \"throughout (A).\"",
    "etymology": "「通じて」 comes from the verb 「通じる」(tsūjiru), meaning 'to pass through' or 'to understand each other.' 「通して」 comes from the verb 「通す」(toosu), meaning 'to let pass' or 'to allow.' The particle 「を」 indicates the object or means by which something is achieved or experienced.",
