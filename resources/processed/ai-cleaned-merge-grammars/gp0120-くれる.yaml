    "etymology": "The verb 「くれる」 originally comes from the verb 「呉る(くれる)」 which meant \"to give\" or \"to grant\". Over time, its meaning became specialized to indicate giving something specifically to the speaker or someone close to them.",
    "writeup": "「くれる」 is one of three verbs used for giving and receiving in Japanese: 「くれる」, 「あげる」, and 「もらう」. 「くれる」 means \"to give\" (to you, or someone that is part of your 'in' group). The giver is marked with 「が」, and the recipient is marked with 「に」. The object that is given is marked with 「を」.  The giver/recipient are often omitted when they are obvious from context. Who someone considers their 'in' group will vary, but it usually includes family members or people in clubs or other groups that you are a part of. When we want to say that we (or someone else) gave something to someone that is *not* in our 'in' group, we will need to use 「あげる」 instead.",
