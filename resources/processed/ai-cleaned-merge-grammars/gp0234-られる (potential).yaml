    "etymology": "The potential form 「られる」 evolved from the passive/respectful form of verbs. Over time, it took on a separate meaning of 'ability' or 'potential'. The base form 「る」 is a suffix that indicates the potential or possibility of an action.",
    "writeup": "The auxiliary verb 「られる」 indicates the **potential** to do something, translating to \"can\" or \"to be able to.\" Its formation varies slightly between verb groups.\n\nFor **Godan (う) verbs**, the final kana of the verb changes to its corresponding え sound, and then 「る」 is added. For example, 「書く」(kaku, to write) becomes 「書ける」(kakeru, can write), and 「泳ぐ」(oyogu, to swim) becomes 「泳げる」(oyogeru, can swim).\n\nFor **Ichidan (る) verbs**, 「られる」 is added directly to the verb stem. For instance, 「食べる」(taberu, to eat) becomes 「食べられる」(taberareru, can eat).\n\nThe irregular verb 「来る」(kuru, to come) takes the potential form 「来られる」(korareru, can come). The irregular verb 「する」(suru, to do) is unique, as its potential form is replaced by 「できる」(dekiru, can do).\n\nWhen using the potential form, either the particle 「を」 or 「が」 can mark the object of the verb. However, it's more common and often feels more natural to use 「が」, especially with potential forms, as it emphasizes the inherent ability or possibility. For instance, 「日本語を話せる」(Nihongo o hanaseru) and 「日本語が話せる」(Nihongo ga hanaseru) are both correct, but the latter often feels more natural for expressing the ability to speak Japanese. An important exception is 「できる」, which **only** takes 「が」 to mark its object (e.g., 「日本語ができます」).\n\n**Common Usage and 'ラ抜き言葉' (ra-nuki kotoba)**\n\nIn modern, casual Japanese, particularly among younger speakers, a phenomenon called 「ラ抜き言葉」(ra-nuki kotoba), or \"ra-omission speech,\" is prevalent. This involves omitting the 「ら」 from the 「られる」 form of Ichidan verbs, resulting in forms like 「食べれる」(tabereru) instead of 「食べられる」(taberareru). While this is widely used in informal settings, it is grammatically incorrect in standard Japanese and should be avoided in formal or written contexts. It can also lead to ambiguity, as the original 「られる」 form can also indicate passive voice, respect, or spontaneous occurrence, which are distinct from potential meaning.\n\n**Comparison with 'ことができる'**\n\nThe expression 「～ることができる」 (koto ga dekiru) also means \"can\" or \"to be able to.\" It can be used interchangeably with the potential form of verbs in many situations. However, 「～することができる」 is generally considered slightly more polite or formal than the direct potential verb form. It is also more versatile as it can be used with any verb, even those for which a direct potential form might not exist or is awkward. For example, while 「する」 becomes 「できる」, other verbs can still take 「～することができる」 (e.g., 「見ることができる」 instead of 「見られる」).",
