    "etymology": "The potential form 「られる」 evolved from the passive/respectful form of verbs. Over time, it took on a separate meaning of 'ability' or 'potential'. The base form 「る」 is a suffix that indicates the potential or possibility of an action.",
    "writeup": "The auxiliary verb 「られる」 indicates the **potential** to do something, translating to \"can\" or \"to be able to.\" It attaches to the stem of verbs, but its formation differs slightly between verb groups. For う-verbs (Group 1), the final kana changes to an え sound before adding 「る」. For る-verbs (Group 2), 「られる」 is added directly to the stem. Note that する becomes できる. When using the potential form, either 「を」 or 「が」 can mark the object, except with 「できる」, which only uses 「が」. Also note that removing the ら, producing so-called 'ラ抜き言葉', like 「食べれる」, is common in casual speech but considered grammatically incorrect.",
