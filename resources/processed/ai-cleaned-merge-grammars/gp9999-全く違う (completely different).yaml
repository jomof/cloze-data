etymology: The adverb 全く (mattaku) is derived from 真 (ma), meaning 'true' or 'genuine,' combined with
  至る (itaru), meaning 'to reach,' and the adverbial suffix く (ku). This suggests 'to truly reach the utmost
  point' or 'entirely.' When paired with 違う (chigau), meaning 'to differ' or 'to be wrong,' the combination
  powerfully conveys the sense of being 'true' or 'utterly' different, or 'absolutely' incorrect. It emphasizes
  an absolute disparity or a complete state of being not as expected.
writeup: |-
  全く違う (mattaku chigau) is a common phrase used to convey that something is 'completely different,' 'entirely wrong,' or 'absolutely dissimilar.' The adverb 全く (mattaku) acts as a strong intensifier, emphasizing the degree of difference or incorrectness. While it can be used in a straightforward manner to state factual differences, it often carries a nuance of strong assertion or even exasperation when used to correct someone or state a strong opposing view. This phrase is highly versatile and can be used in both casual and more formal contexts, although for very formal or written contexts, 異なる (kotonaru) might be preferred with 全く (全く異なる).

  When using 全く違う, it's important to remember that 全く is an intensifier that usually emphasizes a negative or absolute state. It strengthens the meaning of the following verb or adjective, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the degree of difference or incorrectness.

  - term: 全然違う (zenzen chigau)
    meaning: completely different; not at all
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While often interchangeable with 全く違う in casual speech, 全く違う can sound slightly more formal
      or emphatic. 全然違う is very common and leans towards colloquial. Traditionally, 全然 was only used with
      negative verbs, but in modern casual speech, it can sometimes be used with positive meanings, unlike
      全く which remains primarily for strong negation or absolute difference.
    grammar_point: 全然 (not at all; totally)
  - term: 少し違う (sukoshi chigau)
    meaning: a little different; slightly wrong
    kind: antonym
    nuance: This phrase indicates a minor difference or a slight inaccuracy, directly contrasting with
      全く違う's emphasis on absolute disparity.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:少し違う (a little different)
  - term: ほとんど同じ (hotondo onaji)
    meaning: almost the same
    kind: antonym
    nuance: This phrase expresses a high degree of similarity, serving as a clear opposite to 全く違う which
      denotes complete dissimilarity.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ほとんど同じ (almost the same)
  - term: 似ている (nite iru)
    meaning: to resemble; to be similar
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 似ている focuses on the presence of similarities, even if not identical, whereas 全く違う highlights
      the complete absence of similarity.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:似ている (to resemble)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing between 全く違う and 全然違う, consider the level of formality
  and the nuance. 全く違う is generally applicable across registers, maintaining a strong, absolute sense
  of difference or incorrectness. 全然違う is more colloquial and, while often used synonymously, its traditional
  usage with negatives (e.g., 全然分からない - 'don't understand at all') still holds true, even as modern casual
  speech has expanded its use. For expressing minor differences, 少し違う is the appropriate choice. To convey
  near-identity, ほとんど同じ is used. Remember that 全く違う asserts an absolute distinction, emphasizing that
  there is no common ground or correctness.

        english: What she said yesterday and what she's saying today are not different.

    setting: informative
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The speaker uses the polite negative form 「違いません」 to confirm that there is no complete contradiction,
      implying consistency. This is a common way to assert that two things are in alignment, despite potential
      superficial differences.
post_example_writeup: Understanding the nuance of 全く違う is key to expressing strong, absolute distinctions
  in Japanese. It's not just 'different,' but 'completely' or 'utterly' so, and it can be used for both
  factual discrepancies and strong disagreements. Pay attention to the context and the speaker's intent
  to convey the appropriate level of emphasis.
