    "etymology": "しかない is composed of しか (shika), an adverbial particle indicating limitation, and ない (nai), the negative form of ある (aru), meaning 'to exist' or 'to be.' Therefore, literally, it means 'only exists not,' implying that nothing else exists or is possible.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point しかない (shika nai) is a widely used expression in Japanese that typically attaches to verbs in their plain form. It functions to convey a sense of unavoidable action or limited options, translating to 'to have no choice but to (do something)' or 'there is only (something).' It emphasizes that nothing other than the specified action or item is possible.\n\nWhile だけ (dake) implies that a particular option was chosen from several available ones, しか (shika) inherently suggests that the option is the *only* one. This makes しかない a stronger statement than だけ, often implying that external circumstances have constrained the speaker to this single course of action. しかない can also be used with nouns to mean 'only,' indicating a limited quantity or availability.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   In highly casual contexts, especially in manga or anime, しかない may be contracted to っきゃない (kkyanai). This abbreviated form carries the same meaning but is more colloquial and emphatic. While you may encounter it in such media, it is less common in everyday spoken Japanese.",
