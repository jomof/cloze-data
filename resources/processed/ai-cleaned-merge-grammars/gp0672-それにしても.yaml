    "writeup": "「それにしても」 is an expression used to acknowledge a preceding statement or situation while simultaneously emphasizing a different point or opinion. It conveys a nuance of 'even so,' 'nevertheless,' or 'despite that.' The speaker accepts or acknowledges the previous statement as true, yet points out that there is more to be considered, or a particular aspect that stands out beyond what was expected. It implies that the subsequent statement (B) highlights something that is above or beyond the expectation set by the previous statement (A).\n\nThis grammar point often appears at the beginning of sentences or directly after a comma, signaling a shift in focus or a contrasting viewpoint. It is versatile and can be used in various registers, though its direct nature can lean towards more casual or semi-formal contexts depending on the surrounding sentence structure and politeness level. It allows for a subtle yet firm expression of the speaker's true assessment or surprise regarding a situation.",
