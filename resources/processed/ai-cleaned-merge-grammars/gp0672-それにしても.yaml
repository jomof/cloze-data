        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "Generally used. Expresses a sense of 'even so,' 'nevertheless,' or 'despite that,' highlighting that while a preceding statement is acknowledged, there is something more to be considered or a particular aspect that stands out beyond expectation. Typically appears at the beginning of a sentence or directly following a comma."
    },
    "etymology": "The expression それにしても is derived from にしても, which means \"even though\" or \"even if.\" それに adds emphasis, making it \"even so\" or \"nevertheless.\" This evolution signifies a movement from a general conditional acknowledgement to a more emphatic concession, emphasizing that a subsequent observation is remarkable despite the preceding information.",
    "writeup": "「それにしても」 is an expression used to acknowledge a preceding statement or situation while simultaneously emphasizing a different point or opinion. It conveys a nuance of 'even so,' 'nevertheless,' or 'despite that.' The speaker accepts or acknowledges the previous statement as true, yet points out that there is more to be considered, or a particular aspect that stands out beyond what was expected. It implies that the subsequent statement (B) highlights something that is above or beyond the expectation set by the previous statement (A).\n\nThis grammar point often appears at the beginning of sentences or directly after a comma, signaling a shift in focus or a contrasting viewpoint. It is versatile and can be used in various registers. It allows for a subtle yet firm expression of the speaker's true assessment or surprise regarding a situation.",

            "nuance": "Unlike それにしても, しかしながら is more formal and primarily used in written language or very formal speech, serving as a direct logical connector for contrast. 「それにしても」 is more evaluative."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "The key to distinguishing 「それにしても」 from these similar expressions lies in understanding the specific nuance each conveys. 「それにしても」 generally acknowledges a previous point but then redirects focus to another aspect or opinion, often implying a sense of a deeper observation or a notable degree. 「ところが」 introduces an unexpected result. 「それなのに」 emphasizes a strong sense of contradiction or dissatisfaction. 「しかしながら」 is a formal 'however.' 「それでも」 implies persistence or resilience despite circumstances. 「でも」 is a common, casual conjunction for simple contrast.

The use of 「それにしても」 here shows the speaker's surprise at the extent of the difficulty.",
            "etymology": "The expression 「難しすぎる」 (too difficult) uses the suffix 「すぎる」, which is derived from the verb 「過ぎる」 (sugiru), meaning 'to pass, to exceed'. This indicates an excessive degree."

            "etymology": "The phrase 「ひどい降り方」 uses 「方」 (kata) which means 'way' or 'manner'. Originally from 'direction' or 'side', it evolved to describe the method or style of doing something, emphasizing the intense 'manner' of the rain's falling."

            "etymology": "「緊張感」 (kinchōkan) combines 「緊張」 (tension, strain) and 「感」 (feeling, sense). 「感」 as a suffix often forms nouns expressing a 'sense of' or 'feeling of' something, rooted in the idea of perception or sensation."
