    "etymology": "The expression それにしても is derived from にしても, which means \"even though\" or \"even if.\" それに adds emphasis, making it \"even so\" or \"nevertheless.\"",
    "writeup": "それにしても is used to express that despite acknowledging a previous statement or situation, the speaker wishes to emphasize a different point or opinion. It conveys a nuance of 'even so,' 'nevertheless,' or 'despite that.' This expression often highlights that while the speaker accepts or acknowledges the preceding statement as true, there is something more to be considered or a particular aspect that stands out beyond expectation. It is typically found at the beginning of a sentence or directly following a comma, signaling a shift in focus or a contrasting viewpoint.",
