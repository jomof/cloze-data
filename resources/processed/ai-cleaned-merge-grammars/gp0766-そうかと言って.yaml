        "Sentence A + そうかと言って + Sentence B": "Used when responding to a statement (Sentence A) by acknowledging it, but then introducing a counterpoint or a reason why its natural consequence (Sentence B) cannot be fully realized or is problematic. Often Sentence B implies a 'わけにもいかない' or 'できない' type of inability.",
        "Sentence A が、そうかと言って + Sentence B": "Used when the speaker themselves introduces a statement (Sentence A) and then immediately qualifies it with a counterpoint (Sentence B), acknowledging the truth of A but stating why its logical conclusion cannot be accepted."

        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "casual",
        "usage-context": "Generally used in conversational or written contexts to express a reservation or counter-argument to a previous statement.",
        "function": "Introduces a counter-argument or limiting condition, implying that while a preceding statement is acknowledged as true, its full implication cannot be accepted due to other factors.",
        "nuance": "Indicates that while the speaker acknowledges the validity of the preceding statement, they cannot fully embrace its implications due to other factors or considerations. It often conveys a sense of reluctance, conflicting feelings, or an inability to act purely based on the initial statement."
    },
    "etymology": "The phrase is a combination of 「そうか」 (sou ka), meaning \"is that so?\" or \"I see,\" 「と」 (to), a particle, and 「言って」 (itte), the te-form of the verb 「言う」 (iu), meaning \"to say.\" Literally, it means \"saying 'is that so?',\" implying, \"Even granting what you say...\" or \"Even if that is true, saying that...\"",
    "writeup": "「そうかと言って」 (souka to itte) is a crucial expression for nuanced communication in Japanese, allowing speakers to acknowledge a point while simultaneously introducing a caveat or a contrasting perspective. It's used when you accept the truth or validity of a previous statement or premise, but you cannot easily accept the logical conclusion or implication that might naturally follow from it. It functions as a way of introducing a counter-argument or a limiting condition, often highlighting a practical or emotional barrier to embracing the full implication of the initial statement.\n\nThis phrase frequently appears in patterns where the second clause expresses some form of impossibility or difficulty, often utilizing constructions like 「〜わけにもいかない」 (cannot possibly do), 「〜わけではない」 (it's not that...), or 「〜できない」 (cannot do). It’s common in both conversational and written contexts, serving to soften a disagreement or to introduce a more complex, multi-faceted viewpoint.\n\nConsider it a rhetorical device that says, \"Yes, what you said is true, *but*...\" or \"While that may be the case, one cannot simply...\" It allows for a polite yet firm rejection of an oversimplified conclusion based on an acknowledged truth.",

            "meaning": "Just because; that being the case, it doesn't mean...",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While both express a contrast, 「だからと言って」 emphasizes that a certain conclusion doesn't automatically follow from a preceding fact or reason. It questions the *logical* consequence. 「そうかと言って」 acknowledges the validity of a previous statement but then introduces a counter-argument or limitation based on a practical or emotional barrier."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To differentiate between 「そうかと言って」 and 「だからと言って」, remember that 「そうかと言って」 acknowledges the preceding statement as true or understandable, then presents a reason (often practical or emotional) why a direct consequence cannot be accepted. It's like saying, \"Okay, I hear you, *but*...\" In contrast, 「だからと言って」 is more about questioning the *logical* validity of drawing a conclusion from a preceding statement. It's more akin to \"Just because X is true, it doesn't mean Y is true.\" Thus, 「そうかと言って」 often emphasizes the speaker's feelings or practical constraints, whereas 「だからと言って」 emphasizes a logical disconnect.",
