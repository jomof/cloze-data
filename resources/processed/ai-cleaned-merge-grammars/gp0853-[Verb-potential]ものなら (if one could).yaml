formation:
  Verb in potential form + ものなら: Expresses a hypothetical situation that is unlikely to happen, often
    with a desired outcome.
  Verb in potential form + ものだろうか: Used to express a strong, often wistful, desire or wonder about achieving
    something difficult or seemingly impossible. It poses a rhetorical question about the possibility.
jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  usage-context: Used in contexts where the speaker considers an action to be highly difficult, improbable,
    or impossible, but wishes it were possible or considers the consequences if it were.
  function: Expresses a hypothetical condition or a strong, often wistful, desire, emphasizing the difficulty
    or impossibility of the action.
  nuance: Carries a nuance of a strong desire, a challenge, or a regret concerning an improbable condition.
    Conveys a sense of longing, challenge, or even resignation regarding a difficult or unattainable action.
    「ものなら」 often implies a 'if only I could...' with a subsequent action or consequence, while 「ものだろうか」
    is more of a rhetorical question expressing a wish or doubt.
  grammatical-role: Conditional/Volitional expression
etymology: 「ものなら」 is derived from 「もの」 (thing, idea) and 「なら」 (the conditional form of 「だ」). It expresses
  the idea of "if something were a thing," implying a hypothetical and often unrealistic condition. The
  phrase combines the nominalizer 「もの」 (mono) with the conditional 「なら」 (nara) or the conjectural rhetorical
  question 「だろうか」 (darou ka). Historically, 「もの」 emphasizes the 'thing' or 'event' of the potential action.
  Thus, it literally means 'if it were the case that one could (do V)' or 'is it the case that one could
  (do V), I wonder?', thereby highlighting the nature of the hypothetical or desired ability, often implying
  its difficulty or unlikeliness.
writeup: The grammatical pattern 「ものなら」 or 「ものだろうか」 is used to discuss hypothetical situations or express
  strong desires concerning actions that are difficult, improbable, or even impossible to achieve. It
  adds a layer of nuance beyond simple conditionals by emphasizing the challenge or unlikelihood of the
  action. **ものなら (mono nara)** This form is typically used with a potential verb and suggests a strong,
  often wistful, 'if only I could...' scenario. It often implies that if the difficult action *were* possible,
  then a certain consequence would follow, or the speaker would do something. It highlights the slim chance
  or the sheer difficulty of the action. It can sometimes carry a tone of challenge or defiance, meaning
  'if you dare/can, then...'. **ものだろうか (mono darou ka)** Also used with a potential verb, this form functions
  as a rhetorical question, expressing a deep desire or wondering about the possibility of something difficult.
  It translates to 'I wonder if I could (V)' or 'I wish I could (V)'. The speaker is usually acknowledging
  the difficulty but still expressing a longing for that outcome. Both forms convey a strong emotional
  investment in the hypothetical situation, emphasizing the gap between the speaker's desire/consideration
  and the reality of the situation.

  - term: できれば・できたら
    meaning: If possible
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both express possibility, 「できれば」/「できたら」 are more general and don't necessarily imply
      the unlikelihood or strong desire associated with 「ものなら」. 「できれば」/「できたら」 simply state a condition
      that, if met, would lead to a certain outcome.
    grammar_point: できれば・できたら (if possible)
  - term: ようものなら
    meaning: if (something undesirable) were to happen
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ようものなら」 is used when there's a hypothetical condition that, if met, would lead to an undesirable
      and serious consequence. In contrast, 「ものなら」 often expresses a strong wish or a challenge related
      to an unlikely but desired or neutral outcome.
    grammar_point: ようものなら (if undesirable consequences)
  - term: たら
    meaning: If・When・After
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たら」 is a general conditional that simply states 'if X happens, then Y'. It lacks the nuance
      of strong desire, unlikelihood, or challenge that is inherent in 「ものなら」. 「ものなら」 specifically implies
      a condition that is difficult or nearly impossible to achieve.
    grammar_point: たら (conditional, when・if A then B)
  - term: 〜ば (conditional)
    meaning: If・when
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Similar to 「たら」, 「ば」 is a standard conditional. It doesn't inherently convey the sense of
      difficulty or the strong, often wistful, desire present in 「ものなら・ものだろうか」.
    grammar_point: ば (conditional, if A then B)
  - term: 〜たい (desiderative)
    meaning: Want to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「たい」 expresses a straightforward desire. 「ものなら・ものだろうか」, in contrast, expresses a desire specifically
      for something that is difficult or seems impossible to achieve, adding a layer of complexity and
      often wistfulness to the wish.
    grammar_point: たい (want to do)
  - term: 〜ても (even if・even though)
    meaning: Even if・even though
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ても」 sets up a concession, implying that something will happen or be true *regardless* of
      the condition. While it deals with hypothetical situations, it doesn't carry the 'if only I could
      (do something very difficult)' nuance of 「ものなら」 or the 'I wonder if I could (do something seemingly
      impossible)' nuance of 「ものだろうか」.
    grammar_point: ても (even if・even though)
  - term: '[V-potential]ものだ (general truth expectation)'
    meaning: Indicates something is natural, expected, or supposed to be a certain way.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While it also uses 「もの」 and a potential verb, 「V-potential + ものだ」 expresses a general truth,
      common sense, or a strong expectation ('should be able to', 'it is natural to be able to'). It lacks
      the specific hypothetical, difficult-to-achieve, or wistful desire nuance of 「ものなら・ものだろうか」.
    grammar_point: ものだ (general truth expectation)
post_false_friends_writeup: To avoid confusion, remember that 「ものなら」 is used for hypothetical situations
  that are difficult or unlikely to realize, often expressing a strong desire or challenge. In contrast,
  「できれば・できたら」 are general terms for 'if possible' without the strong implication of difficulty or desire.
  「たら」 is a basic conditional that simply states 'if X, then Y', lacking the specific nuance of unlikelihood
  or strong will present in 「ものなら」. Finally, 「ようものなら」, despite its similar form, is specifically used
  when the hypothetical action, if taken, would lead to an undesirable and significant negative consequence,
  a nuance not present in 「ものなら」. When distinguishing 「ものなら・ものだろうか」 from other conditionals or expressions
  of desire, pay close attention to the speaker's implied sentiment. This grammar point specifically highlights
  the speaker's perception of the action as difficult or improbable, unlike simpler conditionals. For
  example, if you want to say 'if I could go to space,' and you perceive this as a highly challenging
  or unlikely feat, you would use 「行けるものなら」. If it were a simple hypothetical without that nuance, 「行けたら」
  would suffice. Similarly, a wish for something difficult is expressed with 「ものだろうか」, whereas a simple
  wish is just 「〜たい」.

      - そんな に 簡単 に できる と 思う {もの なら}、お前 が やっ て みろ よ。

          - そんな に 簡単 に できる と 思う {なら}、君 が やっ て み たら どう だ。
        english: If you think you can do it so easily, how about you try doing it yourself?
        hint: 「なら」 just states a condition, but doesn't imply the unlikelihood or challenge that 「ものなら」
          does. We're looking for a challenging tone, suggesting the task is harder than perceived.
    scene: A frustrated leader responds to a team member who is underestimating the difficulty of a task.
    register: casual
    setting: sarcastic
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The speaker uses 「どう だ」 which is a casual, slightly challenging way of saying "how about it?"
      or "why don't you?" The use of 「君」 for the listener is a direct and somewhat informal address for
      a male speaker addressing a male listener, fitting the challenging tone. 「お前」 in the second variation
      is a more aggressive and clearly male-coded term of address.
    etymology: The phrase 「どう だ」 originates from 「どう で ある」, meaning "how is it?" and has evolved to express
      a casual suggestion or challenge. 「君」 is a pronoun with ancient roots referring to a lord or ruler,
      later becoming a familiar and sometimes condescending second-person pronoun, reflecting the power
      dynamic in this sarcastic scene. The verb 「やっ て みる」 combines 「やる」 (to do) and 「みる」 (to try), indicating
      an attempt, which is what the speaker is challenging the listener to do.
  - english: If my wish could come true, I'd like to travel around the world.
    japanese:
      - もし 願 い が 叶 う {もの なら}、世界 中 を 旅 し たい。
      - もし 願 い が 叶 う {もの なら}、世界 中 を 旅 し たい です。
      - もし 願 い が 叶 う {もの なら}、ぜひ 世界 中 を 旅 し たい と 思い ます。
    english_literally: If a wish could come true, I'd like to travel the whole world.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - もし 願 い が 叶っ {たら}、世界 中 を 旅 し たい。
        english: If a wish were to come true, I'd like to travel the whole world.
        hint: 「たら」 means 'if it happens,' but 「ものなら」 emphasizes a strong, often improbable, desire. We
          want to convey that this wish is unlikely to come true.
    scene: Someone reflecting on their biggest dream, knowing it's highly improbable.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: The speaker expresses a strong desire with 「〜たい」 and introduces the hypothetical with 「もし」,
      emphasizing the dream-like quality of the wish. The choice of verb 「叶う」 (kanau, to come true) naturally
      fits the context of wishes. The addition of 「ぜひ」 and 「と思います」 in the third variation adds a polite
      emphasis to the strong desire.
    etymology: 「もし」 is an adverb that evolved from the conjunction 「申す」 (mōsu), meaning "to say," and
      later acquired the meaning of "if" or "suppose." 「叶う」 comes from 「かなう」 meaning to be realized or
      fulfilled, particularly for wishes. 「世界中」 combines 「世界」 (world) and 「中」 (inside/throughout), reflecting
      the breadth of the speaker's dream.
  - english: If I could go back to that time, I would have wanted to study harder.
    japanese:
      - あの 時 に 戻れる {もの なら}、もっと 一生 懸命 に 勉強 し たかっ た。
      - あの 時 に 戻れる {もの なら}、もっと 一生 懸命 に 勉強 し たかっ た です。
      - あの 時 に 戻れる {もの なら}、もっと 一生 懸命 に 勉強 し たかっ た なあ。
    english_literally: If I could return to that time, I would have wanted to study with all my might.

      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 時 に 戻れ {たら}、もっと 一生 懸命 に 勉強 し たかっ た。
        english: If I could return to that time, I would have wanted to study with all my might.
        hint: 「たら」 indicates a general condition and result. 「ものなら」 specifically emphasizes the impossibility
          of going back in time and the strong regret associated with it.
    scene: A student regretting past academic choices, knowing time travel is impossible.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: The phrase 「〜たかった」 (past tense of 〜たい) expresses a past desire that could not be fulfilled.
      The particle 「に」 in 「あの 時 に」 marks the specific point in time the speaker wishes to return to. The
      casual ending 「なあ」 in the third variation adds a wistful, self-reflective tone.
    etymology: 「あの 時」 literally means "that time," with 「あの」 being a demonstrative pronoun. 「戻れる」 is the
      potential form of 「戻る」 (modoru), meaning "to return," often used for physical return or restoration
      to a previous state. 「一生 懸命」 (isshoukenmei) literally means "with all one's life/effort," conveying
      utmost dedication. 「勉強 し たかった」 indicates a past unfulfilled desire to study.

      - 南極 に 行ける {もの なら}、借金 し て で も 行き たい。
      - 南極 に 行ける {もの なら}、借金 を し て で も 参り たい です。

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 南極 に 行け {たら}、借金 し て で も 行き たい です。
        english: If I could go to Antarctica, even by borrowing money, I want to go.
        hint: 「たら」 expresses a general conditional. 「ものなら」 conveys a stronger sense of desire despite
          the difficulty or unlikelihood, implying a willingness to overcome significant obstacles.
    scene: Someone expressing an extreme desire for an expensive and logistically challenging trip.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: persuasive
    nuance: The use of 「〜てでも」 indicates a strong will to do something even if it involves an extreme measure.
      The politeness of 「〜たいです」 contrasts with the intensity of the desire expressed by 「ものなら」 and 「〜てでも」.
      The third variation uses 「参る」 (mairu), the humble form of 「行く」, adding a more formal and deferential
      tone.
    etymology: 「南極」 (Nankyoku) combines 「南」 (south) and 「極」 (extreme/pole), referring to the South Pole.
      「借金」 (shakkin) means "debt" or "borrowing money." The structure 「〜てでも」 emphasizes doing something
      even at great personal cost or with strong determination. 「行き たい です」 combines the desire form of
      「行く」 (to go) with the polite auxiliary 「です」.
  - english: If it's possible to improve this situation, we should try no matter the cost.
    japanese:
      - もし この 状況 を 改善 できる {もの なら}、どんな 犠牲 を 払っ て も 試す べき だ。
      - もし この 状況 を 改善 できる {もの なら}、どんな 犠牲 を 払っ て も 試す べき です。
      - この 状況 を 改善 できる {もの なら}、どんな 犠牲 を 払っ て も 試す べき だ と 考え ます。

        english: If this situation can be improved, we should try, paying any sacrifice.
        hint: 「たら」 simply states a condition. 「ものなら」 highlights the difficulty or unlikelihood of the
          condition, emphasizing the resolve to overcome it for a critical objective.
    scene: A team leader encouraging colleagues to attempt a difficult solution for a critical problem.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: The phrase 「どんな 犠牲 を 払っ て も」 means "no matter what sacrifices are made," highlighting the
      speaker's strong determination. The concluding 「べき だ」 conveys a strong recommendation or obligation,
      reinforcing the seriousness of the situation. The third variation, 「と 考え ます」, adds a polite and
      considered tone suitable for a formal setting.
    etymology: 「状況」 (jōkyō) refers to the situation or circumstances. 「改善 できる」 is the potential form of
      「改善 する」 (kaizen suru, to improve or ameliorate). 「犠牲 を 払う」 (gisei o harau) is a set phrase meaning
      "to pay a sacrifice" or "to make a sacrifice." 「試す べき だ」 combines 「試す」 (tamesu, to try) with the
      obligation/recommendation auxiliary 「べき だ」, indicating that it's something that should be done.
  - english: If I could catch up to his speed, I would definitely like to try running with him.

          - 彼 の スピード に 追いつけ {たら}、ぜひ 一緒 に 走っ て み たい。
        english: If I could catch up to his speed, I definitely want to try running together.
        hint: 「たら」 indicates a straightforward 'if-then' relationship. 「ものなら」 adds a nuance of deep desire
          and acknowledgment of the difficulty in achieving the hypothetical condition.
    scene: An athlete expressing admiration for a faster runner and a wish to train with them, despite
      the challenge.
    register: casual
    setting: optimistic
    nuance: The phrase 「ぜひ」 (zehi) adds emphasis, meaning "by all means" or "definitely," reinforcing
      the speaker's strong desire. The verb 「追いつける」 (oitsukeru) is the potential form of 「追いつく」 (to catch
      up to someone), directly linking to the ability needed for the hypothetical. The third variation
      uses the casual 「絶対」 (zettai) for emphasis and the informal ending 「な」.
    etymology: 「彼」 (kare) is the third-person pronoun for "he/him." 「スピード」 is a loanword from English.
      「追いつける」 (oitsukeru) is the potential form of 「追いつく」, meaning "to catch up with." 「ぜひ」 is an adverb
      meaning "by all means," emphasizing the speaker's strong desire. 「一緒 に」 means "together." 「走っ て
      み たい」 combines 「走る」 (hashiru, to run) with 「〜てみる」 (to try doing) and 「〜たい」 (to want to do), expressing
      a desire to try running with him.
  - english: If you can solve this problem, go ahead and try.

          - この 問題 を 解決 できる {なら}、やっ て みろ よ。
        english: If you can solve this problem, go ahead and try.
        hint: 「なら」 simply states a condition without implying the unlikeliness or challenge inherent in
          「ものなら」. We're looking for a challenging or skeptical tone.
    scene: A professor challenges a student who boasts about their abilities, subtly implying the task
      is harder than it seems.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: interrogative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of 「やっ て みろ よ」 in the first variation is a direct, masculine, and informal command
      often used by an older male addressing a younger male. 「やっ て ご覧 なさい」 is a politer, but still firm,
      way of issuing a challenge, suitable for a teacher. The third variation emphasizes the act of 'solving'
      with 「解決 し て」.
    etymology: 「解決 できる」 is the potential form of 「解決 する」 (kaiketsu suru, to solve). 「やっ て みろ」 is an imperative
      form of 「やっ て みる」 (to try doing), conveying a direct challenge. 「〜ご覧 なさい」 is a polite imperative
      form meaning "please try to do." 「問題」 (mondai) means "problem."
  - english: If I could turn back time, I would choose a different path.
    japanese:
      - 時間 を 戻せる {もの なら}、別 の 道 を 選ん で い た だろう なあ。
      - 時間 を 戻せる {もの なら}、別 の 道 を 選ん で い た でしょ う ね。
      - あの 時 に 戻れる {もの なら}、違う 道 を 選ん で い た と 思う。

        english: If time were returned, I would have chosen a different path.
        hint: 「たら」 presents a general hypothetical, but 「ものなら」 specifically conveys the impossibility
          of the condition and the strong sense of regret or longing attached to it.
    scene: An elderly woman reflects on her life choices, contemplating what she might have done differently
      if she had the chance to change the past.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The casual ending 「なあ」 in the first variation emphasizes a personal, wistful reflection, common
      in self-talk, often used by female speakers to express sentiment. The second variation uses 「でしょう
      ね」 for a polite, slightly softer, yet still melancholic tone. The phrase 「あの 時 に 戻れる」 is a common
      expression for wishing to return to a past moment.
    etymology: 「時間 を 戻せる」 means "can turn back time." 「別 の 道」 refers to "a different path" or "alternative
      choices." 「〜て い た だろう」 is a conjectural past form indicating what one would have done in a hypothetical
      past. 「あの 時」 (ano toki) means "that time," referring to a specific point in the past.
  - english: If I could fly, I'd travel the world for free.
    japanese:
      - 空 を 飛べる {もの なら}、ただ で 世界 旅行 が し たい な。
      - 空 を 飛べる {もの なら}、ただ で 世界 旅行 を し たい です ね。

          - 空 を 飛べ {たら}、ただ で 世界 旅行 が し たい。
        english: If I could fly, I'd travel the world for free.
        hint: 「たら」 is a simple conditional, while 「ものなら」 emphasizes a strong, almost impossible desire
          or fantasy, reflecting the speaker's wistful dreaming.
    scene: A child daydreams aloud, imagining superhuman abilities and how they would use them.
    register: casual
    setting: optimistic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The informal ending 「な」 and the phrasing 「〜が し たい な」 are characteristic of a child expressing
      a wish or dream. The concept of 「ただ で」 (for free) is simple and direct. The third variation uses
      the more formal 「無料 で」 for 'for free' and 「世界 中 を 旅行 し たい」 for 'travel around the world', which
      can be used by any speaker but is less typical of a very young child.
    etymology: 「空 を 飛べる」 means "can fly in the sky." 「ただ で」 means "for free," which comes from 「只」 (tada)
      meaning 'only' or 'free of charge.' 「世界 旅行」 (sekai ryokō) means "world travel."

        english: If you can win against me in a game, then try winning!
        hint: 「たら」 is a general conditional, but 「ものなら」 adds a direct challenge or dare, implying the
          speaker thinks it's unlikely to happen.
    scene: Two competitive friends are about to start a video game, with one challenging the other confidently.
    register: casual
    setting: commanding
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 「勝っ て みろ よ！」 is a very strong, masculine, and informal command, typical of competitive teasing
      among male friends. 「勝っ て み な！」 is slightly softer but still casual. The third variation, 「ぜひ 勝っ
      て み なさい！」, uses a polite imperative, suggesting a challenge delivered with a hint of sarcasm or
      formal politeness.
    etymology: 「勝てる」 is the potential form of 「勝つ」 (katsu, to win). 「ゲーム で」 indicates the context or means
      (in the game). 「勝っ て みろ」 is the imperative of 「勝っ て みる」 (to try to win).

    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The polite question form 「何 を し たい です か？」 is suitable for a general inquiry in a polite discussion.
      「何 を し ます か？」 is a more direct polite question. The third variation, 「君 なら 何 を する？」, is a casual,
      direct question addressed to a peer, implying a specific personal response. The word 「永遠」 (eien)
      highlights the extreme and hypothetical nature of the condition.
    etymology: 「永遠 に」 means "forever" or "eternally." 「生き られる」 is the potential form of 「生きる」 (ikiru,
      to live). 「何 を する」 means "what to do."
  - english: I wonder if I could fly in the sky just once.
    japanese:
      - 一 度 で いい から、空 を 飛べる {もの だろう か}。
      - 一 度 で いい から、空 を 飛べる {もの で あろう か}。
    english_literally: Just once is good, I wonder if I could fly the sky.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 一 度 で いい から、空 を 飛べ たら いい な。
        english: It'd be nice if I could fly in the sky just once (simple wish).
        hint: This expresses a simple wish using 「〜たら いいな」. It doesn't convey the sense of 'wondering
          if it's even possible' due to the inherent difficulty, which 「ものだろうか」 implies. We're looking
          for an expression that questions the very possibility.
    scene: A child or an adult gazing at birds, expressing a fantastical wish.
    register: casual
    setting: creative
    nuance: 「飛べる ものだろうか」 conveys a strong, wistful desire to do something physically impossible for humans,
      framed as a rhetorical question. The phrase 「一度 で いい から」 intensifies the longing, implying 'just
      once would be enough' to satisfy this deep wish.
    etymology: The phrase 「一度 で いい から」 emphasizes the desire for even a single instance of something,
      often used for things that are difficult or impossible to achieve. Combined with 「ものだろうか」, it heightens
      the sense of yearning.
  - english: Is there really nothing that can be done to help him?
    japanese:
      - 彼 を 助け られる {もの だろう か}。
      - 彼 を 助け られる {もの で あろう か}。
    english_literally: Can he be helped, I wonder?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 を 助け られる か な。
        english: Can we help him? (simple question).
        hint: This uses the simple question particle 「かな」. It's a direct question about ability, lacking
          the rhetorical, almost desperate tone that wonders if it's truly possible, which 「ものだろうか」 implies.
          We're looking for an expression that conveys a deeper sense of inquiry about possibility.
    scene: Two friends discussing a third friend's seemingly hopeless situation.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「助けられる ものだろうか」 expresses a genuine concern and a questioning of whether a difficult situation
      can be overcome. It's not a mere 'can he be saved?', but 'is there *any* way he could possibly be
      saved?' showing deep worry or desperation.
    etymology: The potential form 「助けられる」 (can save/help) combined with 「ものだろうか」 (I wonder if it's possible)
      emphasizes the uncertainty and the deep-seated concern about the ability to help someone in a difficult
      situation. It highlights the speaker's contemplation of the difficulty.
  - english: If I could quit my job right now, I would.
    japanese:
      - 今 すぐ 仕事 を 辞め られる {もの なら} 辞め たい。
      - 今 すぐ 仕事 を 辞め られる {もの でし たら} 辞め たい です。
      - 今 すぐ 仕事 を 辞め られる {もん なら} 辞め たい。
    english_literally: If I could quit work immediately, I want to quit.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今 すぐ 仕事 を 辞め られ たら 辞め たい。
        english: If I could quit my job right now, I'd want to (standard conditional).
        hint: This uses a standard conditional 「〜たら」. While it expresses a wish, it doesn't emphasize
          the underlying difficulty or obstacles to quitting the job as strongly as 「ものなら」 does. We're
          looking for an expression that highlights the challenge.
    scene: A tired worker complaining to a colleague after a long day.
    register: shitashii kuchō (intimate)
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「辞められる もの なら」 emphasizes the strong desire to quit, implying that while it's difficult
      or has significant obstacles (e.g., financial stability, responsibilities), if it were possible
      to overcome them, she would do so. This is a common sentiment expressed among close friends.
    etymology: The use of 「辞めたい」 after 「辞められる もの なら」 directly links the hypothetical possibility to the
      speaker's strong desire, a common construction with 「ものなら」 when expressing a deeply held wish despite
      practical difficulties.
  - english: If only I could meet him just once more, I would tell him how I feel.
    japanese:
      - もう 一 度 だけ 会える {もの なら}、私 の 気持ち を 伝え たい。
      - もう 一 度 だけ 会える {もの でし たら}、私 の 気持ち を 伝え たい です。
    english_literally: If I could meet him just one more time, I want to convey my feelings.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - もう 一 度 だけ 会え たら、私 の 気持ち を 伝え たい。
        english: If I could meet him just once more, I would tell him how I feel (neutral conditional).
        hint: This uses a simple conditional 「〜たら」. It expresses a hypothetical possibility but doesn't
          carry the poignant, almost impossible longing that 「ものなら」 conveys. We're looking for an expression
          that emphasizes the deep, often unfulfillable, wish.
    scene: Someone yearning for a lost connection, perhaps after a breakup or a departure.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: This usage of 「会える もの なら」 vividly expresses a poignant 'if only' for a reunion that is either
      physically impossible (due to distance, death) or emotionally unattainable. It conveys deep longing.
    etymology: The structure 「もう一度 だけ」 emphasizes the singular, cherished nature of the desired meeting,
      further enhancing the melancholic nuance when combined with the near-impossible hypothetical of
      「会える もの なら」.
  - english: I wonder if I could ever live abroad. It seems so difficult.
    japanese:
      - いつ か 海外 で 暮らせる {もの だろう か}。とても 難しい こと だ と 思う。
      - いつ か 海外 で 暮らせる {もの で あろう か}。とても 難しい こと だ と 思い ます。
    english_literally: Someday abroad, I wonder if I could live. I think it is a very difficult thing.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - いつ か 海外 で 暮らせる か な。とても 難しい こと だ と 思う。
        english: I wonder if I can live abroad someday (simple wonder).
        hint: Using 「かな」 just expresses a casual wonder. It doesn't convey the same underlying sense of
          doubt about the feasibility of the difficult action that 「ものだろうか」 does. We're looking for an
          expression that questions the possibility due to perceived difficulty.
    scene: A young adult contemplating their future, feeling daunted by big dreams.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「暮らせる ものだろうか」 reflects a hopeful but uncertain outlook on achieving a significant life change
      like living abroad, acknowledging its inherent difficulties. It's a personal pondering rather than
      a direct question.
    etymology: The addition of 「とても 難しい こと だ と 思う」 explicitly states the perceived difficulty, reinforcing
      the subtle implication of unlikeliness that 「ものだろうか」 already carries.
  - english: If you can criticize someone, why don't you try doing it yourself?
    japanese:
      - 文句 が 言える {もの なら}、自分 で やっ て みれ ば いい じゃ ない か。
      - 文句 が 言える {もの でし たら}、ご 自分 で やっ て みれ ば いい の で は ない でしょう か。
      - 文句 が 言える {もん なら}、自分 で やっ て みれ ば いい じゃ ない か。
    english_literally: If complaints can be said, why don't you try doing it yourself?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 文句 を 言う なら、自分 で やっ て みれ ば いい じゃ ない か。
        english: If you're going to complain, why don't you try doing it yourself? (direct conditional).
        hint: This uses a direct conditional 「〜なら」, which simply sets a condition. It lacks the challenging,
          almost defiant nuance of 「ものなら」, implying 'if you're even capable of it, try it'. We're looking
          for an expression that dares the listener to act.
    scene: A person frustrated with someone's constant complaints but lack of action.
    register: casual
    setting: sarcastic
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 「言える もの なら」 used here is highly rhetorical and carries a sarcastic, challenging
      tone, implying 'you can talk the talk, but can you walk the walk?'. It's a direct challenge for
      the critic to put their words into action. The 「〜じゃないか」 ending makes it more assertive and argumentative.
    etymology: 「やってみれば いい じゃないか」 is a common casual expression to challenge someone to 'try it yourself'
      or suggest 'why don't you just do it?', often used with a slightly exasperated or sarcastic tone
      when one is tired of someone's complaints or inaction.
  - english: Could I possibly understand quantum physics? I doubt it.
    japanese:
      - 量子 物理 学 が 理解 できる {もの だろう か}。無理 だ と 思う けど。
      - 量子 物理 学 が 理解 できる {もの で あろう か}。無理 だ と 思い ます けど。
    english_literally: Quantum physics, could it be understood? I think it's impossible, but...
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 量子 物理 学 が 理解 できる か な。無理 だ と 思う けど。
        english: I wonder if I can understand quantum physics (simple question).
        hint: Using 「かな」 makes it a simple, casual question. It doesn't convey the same level of profound
          doubt or the sense of 'is it even within the realm of possibility for me?' that 「ものだろうか」 implies.
          We're looking for an expression that questions the very possibility of understanding something
          difficult.
    scene: A student struggling with a complex subject, expressing self-doubt.
    register: casual
    setting: academic
    nuance: 「理解 できる ものだろうか」 is used here to express self-doubt and a sense of overwhelm when facing a
      highly challenging academic subject. It's a genuine internal question about one's capability, reinforced
      by the follow-up of 'I think it's impossible'.
    etymology: The scientific term 「量子物理学」 (ryōshi butsurigaku - quantum physics) immediately sets a context
      of high intellectual difficulty, making the self-doubt expressed by 「できる ものだろうか」 particularly apt.
  - english: If I could find a solution to this problem, I would do anything.
    japanese:
      - この 問題 の 解決 策 が 見つけ られる {もの なら}、何 で も する。
      - この 問題 の 解決 策 が 見つけ られる {もの でし たら}、何 で も いたし ます。
    english_literally: If a solution to this problem could be found, I would do anything.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 問題 の 解決 策 が 見つけ られ たら、何 で も する。
        english: If I could find a solution to this problem, I would do anything (neutral conditional).
        hint: This uses a simple conditional 「〜たら」. While it expresses a hypothetical, it doesn't convey
          the strong emphasis on the difficulty of finding the solution or the intense determination to
          overcome obstacles that 「ものなら」 implies. We're looking for an expression that highlights the
          challenge and the speaker's willingness to go to great lengths.
    scene: A researcher or team leader facing a critical, seemingly insurmountable problem.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: In a professional setting, 「見つけられる もの なら」 emphasizes the critical nature and high difficulty
      of finding a solution, suggesting that if such an unlikely event occurred, the speaker would be
      willing to make any sacrifice. This shows deep commitment and acknowledges the challenge.
    etymology: The phrase 「何でも する」 (do anything) is a common expression of extreme determination or willingness,
      which pairs well with the highly conditional and challenging nature of 「ものなら」 in a professional
      context, implying a 'no stone un-turned' attitude.
post_example_writeup: Note how 「ものなら」 is always preceded by a verb in the potential form, emphasizing
  that the situation is hypothetical and dependent on something being possible. The sentence-ending expressions
  like 「〜てみる」, 「〜てみたい」, and various politeness levels add nuance to the speaker's intention, wish, or
  regret. These examples illustrate how 「ものなら」 and 「ものだろうか」 are used to express hypotheticals or desires
  concerning actions that are perceived as difficult, improbable, or impossible. The choice between the
  two often depends on whether the speaker is considering a direct consequence or posing a rhetorical
  question about the possibility. Regardless, both forms add a significant emotional and nuanced layer
  to the statement, highlighting the challenging nature of the action.
