    "etymology": "The grammar point 「とあって」 combines the particle 「と」, indicating a situation or condition, with 「あって」, the て-form of 「ある」 (to be). Therefore, it literally means \"because it is in the state of...\", conveying the nuance that a certain result is natural given the preceding situation.",
    "writeup": "「とあって」 is a formal grammar expression used to indicate that a particular situation or reason naturally leads to a predictable result. It's similar to saying \"since (A), it is no wonder that (B)\" or \"because of (A), it's natural that (B)\". It emphasizes that the result is a logical consequence of the given circumstances.\n\nIt typically follows a noun, な-adjective (with 「だ」 omitted), い-adjective, or verb in its plain form. The key is that 「とあって」 is used **objectively** and does not refer to the speaker's own circumstances or feelings. This is typically found in news reports or other objective writing. You might see it being similar to 「として」 'as', but the focus is more on 'what (A) is or is viewed as', emphasized through 「ある」.",
