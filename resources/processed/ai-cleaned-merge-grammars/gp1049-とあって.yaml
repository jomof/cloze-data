    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the particle 「と」, indicating a condition or situation, with the te-form of the verb 「ある」, meaning \"to be\". It creates a structure where the existence of a condition naturally leads to a specific outcome.",
    "writeup": "「とあって」 (to atte) is a formal grammatical expression, combining the particle 「と」 (to) with the て-form of the verb 「ある」 (aru), meaning 'to be'. It is used to present a specific situation or reason from which a natural, obvious, or expected outcome follows. This expression indicates that the preceding situation is a clear and undeniable cause for the subsequent result. It is often translated as 'since (A), it is no wonder that (B)' or 'because of (A), it's natural that (B)'.\n\n「とあって」 typically attaches to nouns, i-adjectives (plain form), and plain forms of verbs. For な-adjectives, `だ` is usually required before 「とあって」, though it can sometimes be omitted. This construction emphasizes 'what (A) is or is viewed as' through the use of 「ある」, rather than 'how (A) conducts itself'. Critically, 「とあって」 is used objectively, referring to general situations or external facts, and is not typically used to express the speaker's own subjective feelings or states.",
