    "etymology": "This grammar point combines the particle 「と」, indicating a condition or situation, with the te-form of the verb 「ある」, meaning \"to be\". It creates a structure where the existence of a condition naturally leads to a specific outcome.",
    "writeup": "「とあって」 (to atte) is a formal grammatical expression, combining the particle 「と」 (to) with the て-form of the verb 「ある」 (aru), meaning 'to be'. It is used to present a specific situation or reason from which a natural, obvious, or expected outcome follows. This expression indicates that the preceding situation is a clear and undeniable cause for the subsequent result. It is often translated as 'since (A), it is no wonder that (B)' or 'because of (A), it's natural that (B)'.\n\n「とあって」 typically attaches to nouns, i-adjectives (plain form), and plain forms of verbs. For な-adjectives, `だ` is usually required before 「とあって」, though it can sometimes be omitted. This construction emphasizes 'what (A) is or is viewed as' through the use of 「ある」, rather than 'how (A) conducts itself'. Critically, 「とあって」 is used objectively, referring to general situations or external facts, and is not typically used to express the speaker's own subjective feelings or states.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "These expressions all share the commonality of indicating a reason or cause, but they differ significantly in nuance and context. 「とあって」 emphasizes that a specific situation is such a clear and undeniable reason that the subsequent outcome is extremely natural and predictable, carrying a strong implication of 'it is natural that ~ happens because of that situation.' In contrast, 「ので」 and 「から」 are more general conjunctions for indicating reasons; they state a cause-and-effect relationship without the strong connotation of natural inevitability that 「とあって」 conveys. 「ことだから」 is used to infer someone's actions or state based on their known character or reputation, focusing on the person, which distinguishes it from 「とあって」's focus on objective situations. Furthermore, 「だけあって」 also implies a natural consequence, often with a nuance of admiration or a sense that the outcome is 'as expected' given the preceding factor, while 「とあって」 remains more objective in its declaration of natural consequence.",
