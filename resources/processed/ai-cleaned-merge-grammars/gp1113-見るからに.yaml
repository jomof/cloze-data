    "etymology": "The phrase 「見るからに」 is derived from the verb 「見る」 (miru, to see) combined with 「から」 (kara, from) and 「に」 (ni, a particle indicating reason or cause). It literally translates to \"from seeing,\" indicating that the judgment is based on visual observation.",
    "writeup": "**見るからに** (miru kara ni) is a versatile phrase used to express that something is **visibly obvious** or **easily recognizable** simply by looking at it. It strongly emphasizes that the judgment or impression formed is based purely on **visual cues** or **outward appearance**, often leaving little room for doubt. It conveys the sense of \"you can tell just by looking,\" \"visibly,\" or \"obviously.\" This expression is commonly used in everyday conversation and is gender and age-neutral. The register can vary from casual to polite depending on the context and the accompanying sentence-final particles. \n\nThe phrase typically precedes:\n*   **い-adjectives in their `そうだ` form**: This indicates that something *looks* or *appears* to be a certain way, such as delicious (美味しそうだ) or interesting (面白そうだ). For instance, an old building might **見るからに** 古そうだ (look visibly old).\n*   **な-adjectives (often followed by `だ` or `に見える`/`に見える`)**: This implies that a person or thing *is* obviously of a certain quality or identity. For example, a person might **見るからに** 聡明だ (be obviously intelligent), or a situation might **見るからに** 困難そうに見える (visibly appear difficult).\n*   **Nouns (followed by `だ` or `に見える`)**: This signifies that a person or thing *is* obviously of a certain type or role, recognized immediately by their appearance.",
