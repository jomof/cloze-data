    "etymology": "The phrase 「見るからに」 is derived from the verb 「見る」 (miru, to see) combined with 「から」 (kara, from) and 「に」 (ni, a particle indicating reason or cause). It literally translates to \"from seeing,\" indicating that the judgment is based on visual observation.",
    "writeup": "**見るからに** (miru kara ni) is a versatile phrase used to express that something is **visibly obvious** or **easily recognizable** simply by looking at it. It strongly emphasizes that the judgment or impression formed is based purely on **visual cues** or **outward appearance**, often leaving little room for doubt. It conveys the sense of \"you can tell just by looking,\" \"visibly,\" or \"obviously.\" This expression is commonly used in everyday conversation and is gender and age-neutral. The register can vary from casual to polite depending on the context and the accompanying sentence-final particles. \n\nThe phrase typically precedes:\n*   **い-adjectives in their `そうだ` form**: This indicates that something *looks* or *appears* to be a certain way, such as delicious (おいしそうだ) or interesting (面白そうだ). For instance, an old building might **見るからに** 古そうだ (look visibly old).\n*   **な-adjectives (often followed by `だ` or `に見える`)**: This implies that a person or thing *is* obviously of a certain quality or identity. For example, a person might **見るからに** 聡明だ (be obviously intelligent), or a situation might **見るからに** 困難そうに見える (visibly appear difficult).\n*   **Nouns (followed by `だ` or `に見える`)**: This signifies that a person or thing *is* obviously of a certain type or role, recognized immediately by their appearance.\n*   **Verbs in their `ている` form**: This indicates that someone is visibly in the act of doing something or in a particular state, such as hiding something (隠している).",

In casual conversation between female and male friends, such direct observations are common. The phrasing doesn't use gender-specific particles, making it neutral in that regard, but the situation implies an informal setting between peers where such observations can be openly shared without offense, particularly when there's an existing level of trust or concern. The choice of 「隠しているようだった」 or 「隠しているように見えました」 adds a slight softening or less direct assertion, often typical in Japanese even in casual settings to avoid sounding overly accusatory, though the implication is clear. The nuance is in the directness of visual evidence being the sole basis of the conclusion, as reinforced by 「見るからに」 and the following explanation of body language and eye contact."
