    "etymology": "The phrase 「見るからに」 is derived from the verb 「見る」 (miru, to see) combined with 「から」 (kara, from) and 「に」 (ni, a particle indicating reason or cause). It literally translates to \"from seeing,\" indicating that the judgment is based on visual observation.",
    "writeup": "「見るからに」 (miru kara ni) is used to express that something is obvious or easily recognized just by looking at it. It emphasizes that the judgment is based purely on visual information. It often precedes adjectives or nouns that describe the apparent state or quality of something or someone. It can be used in a variety of situations, from describing the appearance of food to assessing someone's health or character. Consider it as similar to saying \"visibly\" or \"obviously\" in English. For example, 「見るからに美味しそうだ」 (miru kara ni oishisou da) means \"it looks obviously delicious.\"",
