        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "teineigo (polite)",
        "usage-context": "Indicates that something is easily recognized or understood simply by looking at it, applicable in both formal and informal settings.",

    "etymology": "The phrase 「見るからに」 is derived from the verb 「見る」 (miru, to see) combined with 「から」 (kara, from) and 「に」 (ni, a particle indicating reason or cause). It literally translates to \"from seeing,\" indicating that the judgment is based on visual observation.",
    "writeup": "**見るからに** (miru kara ni) is a versatile phrase used to express that something is **visibly obvious** or **easily recognizable** simply by looking at it. It strongly emphasizes that the judgment or impression formed is based purely on **visual cues** or **outward appearance**. The phrase often precedes:い-adjectives in their `そうだ` form: This indicates that something *looks* or *appears* to be a certain way, such as delicious (美味しそうだ) or interesting (面白そうだ).な-adjectives or nouns followed by `だ`: This implies that a person or thing *is* obviously of a certain quality or identity, like being intelligent (聡明だ) or Japanese (日本人だ).This grammar point highlights that the visual information is so potent that it leaves no room for doubt about the state or characteristic being described. It's akin to saying 'it looks obviously' or 'you can tell just by looking' in English.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene focuses on a judgment made *purely* from visual observation, distinguishing it from simply stating something 'looks very delicious' without implying the source of that judgment."

                    "mitigation": "The scene focuses on the *appearance* of tiredness based on observation, not a definitive statement about his actual state, guiding the user to use 「見るからに」 for impressions made on sight."

            "setting": "humorous",
            "nuance": "This applies 「見るからに」 to a noun (`いたずらっ子`), describing an obvious characteristic based on visual impression. The casual `だ` ending suits the humorous and observational context."
