        "usage-context": "Standard/General",
        "function": "Connects a situation or reason with a subsequent deliberate action or decision, emphasizing volitional action.",
        "nuance": "Highlights a controllable and often immediate response to a preceding situation, suggesting a logical and intentional next step taken by the agent. It implies a conscious decision-making process.",

    },
    "etymology": "「そこで」 is derived from 「そこ」 (there) and the particle 「で」, which indicates a place or situation where something happens. The 「で」 implies an action or decision arising from that particular place or situation, suggesting that the action is performed 'at' or 'by means of' that context.",
    "writeup": "「そこで」 (sokode) is a conjunction used to connect a situation or reason with a subsequent action, decision, or conclusion. While sometimes seen as 其処で, this kanji usage is rare. It conveys meanings such as \"therefore,\" \"accordingly,\" or \"as such.\" This expression indicates that the second clause is a direct, deliberate, and often volitional response to the situation described in the first clause. It's similar to saying \"given that situation, this is what happens next.\" A key characteristic of 「そこで」 is its focus on actions that are within one's control, distinguishing it from expressions that merely state a natural consequence. It often follows a sentence that establishes the initial situation, before 「そこで」 introduces the intentional action taken to resolve or address that situation.",
