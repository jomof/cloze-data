    "etymology": "「そこで」is derived from 「そこ」 (soko, \"there\") and the particle 「で」 (de), indicating a location or situation where something occurs. Literally, it means \"at that place/situation,\" implying a direct connection between the preceding context and the following action or decision.",
    "writeup": "「そこで」 (sokode) is a conjunction that links a situation or reason to a subsequent action or decision. Think of it as a more versatile \"therefore\" or \"accordingly.\" The nuance is that the action in the second clause is a direct response to the situation described in the first. It's similar to saying \"as such\" or \"to that end\" in English.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The first sentence sets the stage, highlighting the situation.\n*   「そこで」 introduces the resolution or action taken in response to that situation.\n*   It implies a controllable or logical reaction to the given circumstances.",
