    "etymology": "The grammar point 「上に」 literally means \"on top of\" or \"in addition to\" in a physical sense. This meaning has been extended to describe adding information or qualities, similar to piling one thing on top of another.",
    "writeup": "「上に」 is a grammar pattern used as a somewhat formal way of saying \"and\" in Japanese. It expresses that something is 'in addition to (A),' 'as well as (A),' or 'besides (A).' Literally, it means 'on top of (A), (B)'. It is used to highlight qualities that are equivalent to each other. For example, a good thing and another good thing, or a bad thing and another bad thing. It can follow verbs and い-adjectives in their plain form. な-adjectives are followed by 「な上に」, and nouns are followed by 「の上に」. Sometimes, the 「に」 can be dropped without changing the meaning.",
