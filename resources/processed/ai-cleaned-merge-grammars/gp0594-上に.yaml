        "source": "DOJG, Bunpro"
    },
    "etymology": "The etymology of 「上に」 can be understood by breaking it down. 「上」 (ue) means \"above\" or \"on top,\" and 「に」 (ni) is a particle indicating location or direction. Therefore, 「上に」 literally means \"on top of\" something. This conveys the sense of adding something more to what is already there, similar to adding another layer on top of an existing one, reinforcing the idea of accumulation or addition.",
    "writeup": "「上に」 (ue ni) is a grammar pattern used to express that something is \"in addition to\" or \"besides\" something else. It functions as a slightly formal way of connecting two pieces of information, presenting the second as an additional quality or action that compounds the first. Think of it as saying \"on top of (A), (B) also applies.\"\n\nThis pattern is versatile and can follow various parts of speech:\n*   **Verbs** (plain form) + 「上に」: For example, 「食べる上に」 (in addition to eating).\n*   **い-Adjectives** (plain form) + 「上に」: For example, 「美味しい上に」 (in addition to being delicious).\n*   **な-Adjectives** + 「な」 + 「上に」: For example, 「静かな上に」 (in addition to being quiet).\n*   **Nouns** + 「の」 + 「上に」: For example, 「医者の上に」 (in addition to being a doctor).\n*   **Nouns** + 「である」 + 「上に」: This is a more formal or objective way to connect nouns, for example, 「学生である上に」 (in addition to being a student).\n\nThe particle 「に」 can sometimes be omitted from this structure (e.g., 「上」), particularly in very casual speech or certain fixed expressions, but including it is more common and generally recommended for clarity.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n「上に」 is crucially used to highlight qualities or actions that are equivalent or similar in nature. This means you typically connect two positive attributes (e.g., \"good and also convenient\") or two negative attributes (e.g., \"expensive and also small\"). Using 「上に」 to connect contradictory attributes (e.g., \"handsome and also rude\") might sound unnatural or sarcastic. While not always strictly prohibited, it's generally best to maintain a consistent tone or logical relationship between the two clauses when using this pattern.",
