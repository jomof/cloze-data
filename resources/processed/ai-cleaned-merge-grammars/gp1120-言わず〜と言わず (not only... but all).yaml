jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: formal
  usage-context: Used to express that something applies to a wide range of things or situations, not just
    the ones mentioned.
  function: Emphasizes the comprehensiveness of the statement.
  nuance: Implies that the mentioned items are merely representative examples of a broader category, signifying
    that the statement holds true for all members of that category.
  counterpoint: Often contrasted with simple enumeration using particles like も (mo) or や (ya), as と言わず〜と言わず
    implies a more exhaustive or pervasive applicability.
  grammatical-role: This phrase functions as a comprehensive modifier, indicating the scope or extent
    of the preceding statement.
  logical-flow: The logical flow indicates that a specific characteristic or action is true across an
    entire spectrum, using two examples to represent the whole. It moves from specific examples to a generalized
    truth.
  temporal-flow: When used with time-related nouns, it implies continuous or pervasive action across an
    entire time span.
  spatial-flow: When used with location-related nouns, it implies pervasive coverage across an entire
    area or range of locations, encompassing every part.
etymology: The grammar point 「言わず~と言わず」 literally means "without saying A, without saying B." It implies
  that the mentioned items are just examples and there's no need to explicitly state everything covered.
  The '言わず' part is the imperfective form of the verb '言う' (iu, to say), implying 'without saying' or
  'without mentioning'. This phrasing evolved to suggest that the scope is so broad it's unnecessary to
  list every single item, as the examples provided are sufficient to convey the comprehensive nature.
writeup: |-
  The grammatical pattern 「言わず~と言わず」 is employed to convey that a statement or action applies not merely to the specific items mentioned, but broadly and comprehensively to all items within a given category. It highlights the universality or pervasive nature of the situation, often implying that the items listed are just a few prominent examples among many. This structure is particularly effective when you want to emphasize that something is true across an entire spectrum, leaving no exceptions.

  While the grammar point name may include 'Verb[imperfective]' in its broader classification (due to '言わず' being a verb form), this pattern is predominantly used by connecting two representative **nouns** to illustrate a broader range. However, it can also be used with two imperfective verb forms to imply a comprehensive range of actions or senses.
false_friends:
  - term: 言うまでもなく
    meaning: needless to say, it goes without saying
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「言わず~と言わず」, 「言うまでもなく」 introduces something obvious and doesn't necessarily imply a
      broader range or comprehensive applicability.
    grammar_point: は言うまでもない (goes without saying)
  - term: 〜はもちろん
    meaning: of course; needless to say; not to mention
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「〜はもちろん」 also introduces something obvious, it emphasizes that something else is also
      true, often something unexpected or surprising, unlike 「言わず~と言わず」 which stresses the comprehensive
      applicability across a range of items.
    grammar_point: はもちろん (not only... but also)
  - term: 〜から〜まで
    meaning: from ~ to ~
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「言わず~と言わず」, 「〜から〜まで」 specifies clear start and end points, whereas 「言わず~と言わず」 uses
      two examples to imply a broader, often exhaustive, set without explicit boundaries.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:から〜まで (from ~ to ~)
  - term: 〜にかかわらず
    meaning: regardless of; irrespective of
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「〜にかかわらず」 also suggests comprehensiveness, it implies that a situation holds true irrespective
      of differences between specified items. 「言わず~と言わず」 uses the items as representative examples of
      a broader set where the characteristic is universally true.
    grammar_point: にかかわらず (regardless of)
  - term: も~も
    meaning: both・neither ~ nor
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「〜も〜も」 simply lists two or more items or states, 「言わず~と言わず」 uses the mentioned items
      as representative examples to emphasize that a statement is comprehensively true for an entire category,
      without explicitly needing to list all possibilities.
    grammar_point: も~も (both neither ~ nor)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「言うまでもなく」 and 「〜はもちろん」 might appear similar, they carry distinct nuances.
  「言うまでもなく」 is used for stating facts that are considered self-evident. 「〜はもちろん」 serves to highlight an
  obvious inclusion while also pointing to something less obvious. In contrast, 「言わず~と言わず」 specifically
  emphasizes that a characteristic or action is universally true for a broad category, using specific
  examples to illustrate this all-encompassing nature. Similarly, while 「〜から〜まで」 indicates a clear range,
  「言わず~と言わず」 implies a pervasive presence without strict boundaries. Lastly, 「〜にかかわらず」 focuses on something
  being true irrespective of listed items, whereas 「言わず~と言わず」 uses them as representative of a complete
  set, and 「〜も〜も」 simply lists items without the same emphasis on comprehensive reach.

        english: He is absorbed in his research morning and night.
        hint: 「朝も夜も」 lists specific times. We're looking for an expression that implies a tireless, all-encompassing
          effort.

          - 彼 は 朝 {から} 夜 {まで}、ひたすら 研究 に 没頭 し て いる。
        english: He is absorbed in his research from morning to night.
        hint: 「〜から〜まで」 specifies definite start and end points. We're looking for an expression that implies

      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 朝夜 {に かかわら ず}、ひたすら 研究 に 没頭 し て いる。
        english: He is absorbed in his research regardless of morning or night.
        hint: 「〜にかかわらず」 means 'regardless of' and suggests indifference to the difference between two
          items. We're looking for an expression that indicates comprehensive inclusion of both mentioned
          items and beyond.
    scene: A dedicated scientist who works tirelessly, demonstrating extreme focus on his studies.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: This highlights the speaker's continuous and unwavering dedication to research, not limited
      by the distinction between 「朝」 (morning) and 「夜」 (night), implying round-the-clock commitment. It
      emphasizes the exhaustive nature of his focus.
    etymology: The usage of specific time nouns like 「朝」 and 「夜」 emphasizes the all-encompassing nature
      of the action, suggesting that no time is excluded from the activity, similar to the historical
      development of the phrase implying no need to list all possibilities due to pervasive applicability
      across all times.
  - english: In this company, from top executives to new employees, everyone puts their heart into their
      work.
    japanese:

        english: In this company, from top executives to new employees, everyone puts their heart into
          their work.
        hint: 「〜から〜まで」 suggests a clear hierarchy or range. We need a phrase emphasizing that the quality
          applies broadly to everyone, irrespective of their position.
    scene: A company meeting where the CEO is praising the collective dedication of all staff members.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The phrase 「経営者 と言わず 新入社員 と言わず」 highlights that the dedication is universal across all levels
      of the company, from the highest to the lowest, without making explicit distinctions.
    etymology: The use of contrasting roles like '経営者' (management) and '新入社員' (new employees) showcases
      the comprehensive scope, implying that the sentiment applies to everyone, regardless of specific
      status, mirroring the original broad implication of the grammar.
  - english: The child, from head to toe, was covered in mud from playing outside.

      in mud.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 子供 は 全身 が 泥 {だらけ} に なっ て い た。
        english: The child's whole body was covered in mud.
        hint: While 「だらけ」 means 'covered in', the original phrase emphasizes the extent of coverage by
          mentioning specific body parts, implying every part in between, rather than just stating a general
          'whole body'.
    scene: A mother sees her child after they've been playing vigorously outdoors.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: 「頭 と言わず 足 と言わず」 vividly describes the child's complete state of being covered in mud by mentioning
      the two extremes (head and feet), implying the entire body. The casual tone suits a personal observation.
    etymology: Using polar opposites like '頭' (head) and '足' (feet) effectively conveys a sense of total
      coverage, demonstrating the grammar's ability to imply 'everything in between' without listing it.
  - english: His talents extend to both singing and dancing, and everything in between.
    japanese:
      - 彼 の 才能 は 歌 {と 言わ ず} ダンス {と 言わ ず}、多岐 に わたっ て いる。

        english: His talent in both singing and dancing extends across various fields.
        hint: 「も〜も」 lists multiple items. We need an expression that implies a broader range of talents
          beyond just the two mentioned.
    scene: A music teacher describing a student's exceptional and broad artistic abilities.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: This emphasizes that his talents are not limited to just singing and dancing, but are wide-ranging,
      suggesting he excels in many artistic areas. The phrase effectively implies 'any artistic discipline'.
    etymology: The selection of '歌' (singing) and 'ダンス' (dancing) as examples from the arts demonstrates
      how the grammar point can be used to imply comprehensive skill within a domain without exhaustively
      listing all possible talents.
  - english: He's always busy no matter the day or time, working even on weekdays and holidays.
    japanese:

        english: He works busily on both weekdays and holidays.

          encompassing all days, not just those two types.
    scene: Two colleagues discussing a particularly diligent but overworked team member.
    register: casual
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: This highlights the relentless nature of his work, which doesn't distinguish between weekdays
      and holidays, indicating a constant state of being busy. The casual tone fits a conversation between
      colleagues.
    etymology: The use of '平日' (weekday) and '休日' (holiday) to encompass the entire week demonstrates
      the grammar's ability to signify a continuous state or action, regardless of specific temporal distinctions.
  - english: The detective interviewed everyone without distinguishing between old or young, leaving no
      stone unturned.
    japanese:

        english: The detective interviewed all involved parties regardless of age or gender.
        hint: 「〜にかかわらず」 emphasizes ignoring distinctions. We need a phrase that uses specific categories
          to imply comprehensive inclusion of everyone.
    scene: A grizzled detective meticulously gathering information during a complex investigation.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: This emphasizes the thoroughness of the investigation by indicating that no one, regardless
      of age (老若) or gender (男女), was overlooked, suggesting a complete and exhaustive process.
    etymology: The pairing of '老若' (old and young) and '男女' (male and female) creates an exhaustive demographic,
      demonstrating how this grammar point signifies comprehensive inclusion, meaning 'everyone' in this
      context.
  - english: During the inspection, we checked everything from inside to outside of the building.

      every corner was confirmed.
    competing_grammar:

        english: During the inspection, both the interior and exterior of the building were confirmed
          to every corner.
        hint: 「も〜も」 lists two parts. We need an expression that implies a full, comprehensive check that
          leaves no part unchecked.
    scene: A construction manager explaining the thoroughness of a recent building safety inspection.
    register: formal
    setting: technical
    nuance: This stresses the exhaustive nature of the inspection, covering every part of the building,
      inside and out. It implies that no area was left unchecked.
    etymology: The use of '内部' (interior) and '外部' (exterior) illustrates the grammar's application to
      spatial comprehensiveness, where mentioning these two extremes implies total coverage of a physical
      object or area.
  - english: In a true emergency, people act without thinking or reflecting, just moving instinctively.
    japanese:

        english: In a true emergency, people move instinctively without thinking or looking back.
        hint: This phrase explicitly negates two actions. We need an expression that implies the absence
          of *any* rational or reflective thought, encompassing all such mental processes.
    scene: A psychologist explaining human behavior during crisis situations.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: This particular example, using verbs, emphasizes that in a crisis, mental processes like thinking
      or reflecting cease; people act purely instinctively, covering all forms of conscious deliberation.
    etymology: Using abstract verbs like '考える' (to think) and '振り返る' (to look back/reflect) extends the
      concept of comprehensive coverage to mental states, suggesting a complete lack of certain cognitive
      functions in extreme situations.
  - english: To achieve a major project, you must put in effort both day and night, never resting.
    japanese:
      - 大 プロジェクト を 達成 する に は、寝る {と 言わ ず} 起きる {と 言わ ず}、絶え ず 努力 し なけれ ば なら ない。

      must make constant effort.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 大 プロジェクト を 達成 する に は、寝 {て も} 起き {て も}、絶え ず 努力 し なけれ ば なら ない。
        english: To achieve a major project, whether sleeping or waking, one must make constant effort.
        hint: 「〜ても〜ても」 implies that the effort is required under various conditions. We are looking for
          an expression that signifies *continuous* effort, not just during specific states.
    scene: A project manager motivating their team to push through the final stages of a demanding project.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: This implies continuous, non-stop effort, regardless of whether one is traditionally 'resting'
      or 'active.' It means the dedication must be constant, encompassing all states of being.
    etymology: The selection of '寝る' (to sleep) and '起きる' (to wake) illustrates the grammar point's capacity
      to express an uninterrupted state or activity, implying that effort is required around the clock.
  - english: The sudden news spread from the town center to the outskirts, reaching everyone.
    japanese:
      - その 突然 の ニュース は、街 の 中心 {と 言わ ず} 周辺 {と 言わ ず}、瞬く 間 に 広まっ た。
      - その 突然 の ニュース は、街 の 中心 {と 言わ ず} 周辺 {と 言わ ず}、瞬く 間 に 広まり まし た。
    english_literally: That sudden news, town's center without saying, outskirts without saying, spread
      in an instant.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 突然 の ニュース は、街 の 中心 {から} 周辺 {まで}、瞬く 間 に 広まっ た。
        english: That sudden news spread from the town center to the outskirts in an instant.
        hint: 「〜から〜まで」 specifies a clear range. We need a phrase that conveys widespread diffusion, implying
          every part of the area.
    scene: A journalist reporting on how quickly surprising news disseminated throughout a community.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: This emphasizes the rapid and complete dissemination of the news across the entire town, from
      its core to its periphery, indicating no part was untouched.
    etymology: Using '中心' (center) and '周辺' (outskirts) exemplifies how the grammar point can denote spatial
      comprehensiveness, meaning the news covered 'everywhere' within the defined area.
post_example_writeup: The pattern 「言わず~と言わず」 effectively conveys a sense of thoroughness and comprehensiveness.
  It indicates that the phenomenon or characteristic described is not confined to the specific items mentioned
  but extends across the entire category they represent. This negates the need to list every single instance,
  as the provided examples serve to illustrate this all-encompassing nature.
