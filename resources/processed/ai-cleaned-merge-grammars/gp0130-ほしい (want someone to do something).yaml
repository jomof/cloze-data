        "Status Consideration": "This grammar point is typically used when the person you want to do something is of equal or lower status. To use this with someone of higher status, use もらいたい instead.",
        "Particle Usage": "The person you want to do something is marked with the particle 「に」."
    },
    "writeup": "「ほしい」, meaning \"want,\" is used to express your desire for someone to do something. Specifically, you use the て-form of a verb followed by 「ほしい」or 「ほしいです」. The person you want to perform the action is marked with the particle 「に」. For example, 「あなたに英語を教えてほしいです」 means \"I want you to teach me English.\" It is **important** to note that 「ほしい」is typically used when the person you're asking is of equal or lower status than you. If you're asking someone of higher status, you would use 「もらいたい」instead. You can also use the negative form 「ほしくない」 to express that you *don't* want someone to do something.",
    "etymology": "「ほしい」 comes from the verb 「欲しがる (hoshigaru)」, which means \"to want\" or \"to desire.\" Over time, 「ほしい」evolved into an adjective used to express one's own desires, or the desire for someone else to do something.",
