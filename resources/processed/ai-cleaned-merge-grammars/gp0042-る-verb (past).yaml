        "function": "Indicates completion, past action, or resulting state.",

        "grammatical-role": "Modifies verbs to indicate past tense or perfective aspect."
    },
    "etymology": "The past tense form 「た」 originates from the auxiliary verb 「たり」 in classical Japanese. 「たり」 indicated completed action or perfective aspect. Over time, 「たり」 evolved into 「た」 and became the standard past tense marker for verbs.",
    "writeup": "To form the past tense of a **る-verb** in Japanese, you first remove the final 「る」 from its dictionary form. Then, you attach the auxiliary verb 「た」 for the casual past tense. For the polite past tense, you attach 「ました」. It's important to understand that 「ました」 is a compound form of the polite auxiliary 「ます」 and the past auxiliary 「た」. Thus, only 「た」 truly conveys the past tense meaning, while 「ます」 maintains its role of adding politeness. The auxiliary 「た」, when attached to verbs, can convey three primary nuances:\n*   **Past**: Indicates an action that occurred at some point in the past (e.g., 'did' or 'was').\n*   **Completion**: Signifies an action that has finished (e.g., 'done').\n*   **Continuation**: Describes a new state that has commenced and is ongoing (e.g., 'has been done').",
