jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: verb
  usage-context: general
  function: Indicates completion, past action, or resulting state.
  nuance: The auxiliary 'た' has nuanced meanings beyond simple past, including completion and a continuing
    state.
  grammatical-role: Modifies verbs to indicate past tense or perfective aspect.
  temporal-flow: Indicates an action completed in the past or a resulting state that continues into the
    present, distinguishing from ongoing or future actions.
  spatial-flow: Does not inherently denote spatial flow, but the action described may involve movement
    or location changes that are now complete, establishing a new spatial state.
etymology: The past tense form 「た」 originates from the auxiliary verb 「たり」 in classical Japanese. 「たり」
  indicated completed action or perfective aspect. Over time, 「たり」 evolved into 「た」 and became the standard
  past tense marker for verbs.
writeup: |-
  To form the past tense of a **る-verb** in Japanese, you first remove the final 「る」 from its dictionary form. Then, you attach the auxiliary verb 「た」 for the casual past tense. For the polite past tense, you attach 「ました」. It's important to understand that 「ました」 is a compound form of the polite auxiliary 「ます」 and the past auxiliary 「た」. Thus, only 「た」 truly conveys the past tense meaning, while 「ます」 maintains its role of adding politeness. The auxiliary 「た」, when attached to verbs, can convey three primary nuances:
  *   **Past**: Indicates an action that occurred at some point in the past (e.g., 'did' or 'was').
  *   **Completion**: Signifies an action that has finished (e.g., 'done').
  *   **Continuation**: Describes a new state that has commenced and is ongoing (e.g., 'has been done').

  - term: ている
    meaning: is ~ing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「る-verb (past)」, 「ている」 indicates an ongoing action or a state resulting from an action.
    grammar_point: ている (~ing)
  - term: ～てしまう
    meaning: to do something completely; to do something accidentally/regrettably
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「る-verb (past)」 simply states a past action, 「～てしまう」 adds nuance of completion, decisiveness,
      or regrettability.
    grammar_point: てしまう・ちゃう (completion・regret・accident)
  - term: ～たばかり
    meaning: just did (something)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「る-verb (past)」 refers to any past action, whereas 「～たばかり」 specifically indicates an action
      that was completed very recently.
    grammar_point: たばかり (just did)
  - term: い-adjective (past)
    meaning: was (i-adjective)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「る-verb (past)」 describes completed actions of verbs, 「い-adjective (past)」 describes
      past states or qualities of i-adjectives.
    grammar_point: い-adjective (past)
  - term: だった・でした (past copula)
    meaning: was (noun/na-adjective)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「る-verb (past)」 expresses a past action or state of a verb, whereas 「だった・でした」 indicates a
      past state or identity for nouns and na-adjectives.
    grammar_point: だった・でした (past copula)
post_false_friends_writeup: Be mindful to distinguish between the past tense 「た / ました」, which indicates
  a completed action, and the progressive form 「ている / ています」, which indicates an ongoing action or a state
  resulting from an action. The former describes what *did* happen, and the latter describes what *is*
  happening or the state that exists now. Also, be aware of expressions that add further nuance to completed
  actions, such as 「～てしまう」 for completion or regret, and 「～たばかり」 for actions that have just occurred.
  Furthermore, remember that the past forms of i-adjectives (e.g., 「暑かった」 for 'was hot') and nouns/na-adjectives
  (e.g., 「学生だった」 for 'was a student') follow different conjugation patterns than verbs.

    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 今日、ご飯 を {食べ て いる}。
        english: I am eating rice today.
        hint: 「～ている」 indicates an action currently in progress or a state resulting from a past action.

        english: I intend to eat rice today.

          action in the past.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 今日、ご飯 を {食べる}。
        english: I eat rice today.

          - 私 は 今日、ご飯 を {食べ た ばかり} だ。
        english: I just ate rice today.

    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The use of 「食べた」 in this domestic context highlights the directness typical among family members.
      While 「食べました」 is also valid, 「食べた」 is more common in this casual setting. The particle 「よ」 can add

post_example_writeup: As you can see from the examples, the choice between the plain form (～た) and the
  polite form (～ました) depends heavily on the social context and your relationship with the listener. The
  meaning of the past action remains the same, but the level of politeness changes. Always consider your
  audience when choosing which form to use. The nuance descriptions highlight how certain forms or sentence-ending
  particles, like 「よ」 or 「わ」, can subtly alter the feeling conveyed, even with the same core grammatical
  structure.
