    "writeup": "The particle で, in its temporal sense, functions to indicate a limit or boundary in time. It conveys the meaning of \"by\" a certain time or \"at\" a particular time, specifically marking the conclusion of a period or the arrival of a deadline. This usage of で often highlights when an action or state will be completed or when a duration has fully elapsed. It distinctively marks the point where something *ends* or *culminates*. For instance, 五時で終わり (ends at five o'clock) clearly indicates the termination of an activity at that precise moment. When combined with から, forming the pattern [Starting Point] から [Ending Point] で, it specifies a duration, meaning \"from [start time] to [end time], terminating at the latter.\" It is vital to distinguish this temporal application of で from its other common functions, such as indicating location (e.g., 駅で待つ - 'wait at the station') or means (e.g., 車で来た - 'came by car').",
