        "particle-pragmatic-function": "limiting",
        "function": "This particle specifies a time limit or boundary, marking the point at which an action or event terminates. It can also indicate duration when paired with 「から」.",
        "nuance": "「で」 indicates 'at' or 'by' a specific time, emphasizing the completion or culmination of something at that precise moment or by that deadline.",
        "counterpoint": "It is crucial to contrast this usage with 「に」, which generally pinpoints a specific moment in time (e.g., 'at 5 o'clock'), while 「で」 more often signifies the end point of a period or the termination of an activity.",
        "colocation": "Frequently used with time expressions, such as 「今日で」 (by today), 「今週で」 (by this week), or 「来月で」 (by next month)."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「で」 originally indicated location or means of action. Its temporal usage evolved from this, conceptually marking the 'location' where something ceases or culminates on a timeline. This is a grammaticalization, extending its original function of indicating an instrumental or locative boundary to a temporal one.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「で」, in its temporal sense, functions to indicate a limit or boundary in time. It conveys the meaning of \"by\" a certain time or \"at\" a particular time, specifically marking the conclusion of a period or the arrival of a deadline. This usage of 「で」 often highlights when an action or state will be completed or when a duration has fully elapsed. When combined with 「から」, forming the pattern 「[Starting Point] から [Ending Point] で」, it specifies a duration, meaning \"from [start time] to [end time].\" It is vital to distinguish this temporal application of 「で」 from its other common functions, such as indicating location (e.g., 「駅で待つ」 - 'wait at the station') or means (e.g., 「車で来た」 - 'came by car').",
