    "etymology": "The origin of 「好き (suki)」 can be traced back to the verb 「好く (suku)」, which meant \"to be fond of\" or \"to prefer.\" Over time, 「好く」 evolved into the noun-like adjective 「好き」, retaining its core meaning of affection or preference.",
    "writeup": "「好き (suki)」, meaning \"to like,\" is a common な-adjective used in various expressions. Like all な-adjectives, it behaves somewhat like a verb in that its form changes depending on what follows it. For instance, 「好き」 is followed by 「な」 when it functions as an adjective modifying a noun (e.g., 「好きな 本 (suki na hon)」 - \"a favorite book\"). When it acts as a predicate, directly stating a preference, it is typically followed by 「だ (da)」 in plain form or 「です (desu)」 in polite form. This distinction is crucial for correct usage.",
