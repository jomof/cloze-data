    "etymology": "The origin of 「好き (suki)」 can be traced back to the verb 「好く (suku)」, which meant \"to be fond of\" or \"to prefer.\" Over time, 「好く」 evolved into the noun-like adjective 「好き」, retaining its core meaning of affection or preference.",
    "writeup": "「好き (suki)」, meaning \"to like,\" is a common な-adjective used in various expressions. な-adjectives behave similarly to verbs, changing form depending on the following words. 「好き」 is followed by 「な」 when acting as an adjective modifying a noun or by 「だ」 (plain) or 「です」 (polite) when acting as a predicate.  When used with people, 「好き」 can imply romantic interest, especially with 「大好き (daisuki)」 meaning \"love.\"",
