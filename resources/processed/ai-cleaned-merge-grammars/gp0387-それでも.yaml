    "etymology": "「それでも」 is a combination of 「それ」 (that) and 「でも」 (even). Literally, it means \"even with that.\"",
    "writeup": "「それでも」 connects two phrases or sentences, A and B, to convey that despite the condition or information stated in A, B is still the case or will still happen. It inherently carries a nuance of surprise or unexpectedness, suggesting that the outcome in B occurs **even with** the preceding circumstance A. This makes it slightly different from a simple 'but' or 'however', as it emphasizes a situation where an action or state persists against expectations.\n\nWhile often translated as \"even so,\" \"nevertheless,\" or \"and yet,\" the literal sense, \"even with that,\" helps grasp its core meaning. It is used when a situation or feeling persists despite an opposing factor, or when a decision is made regardless of a difficulty.\n\nFor instance, if it is raining (A), but one decides to go fishing anyway (B), 「それでも」 captures that persistence. It highlights the speaker's resolve or the surprising reality of B in the face of A.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「しかしながら」 is more formal and primarily used in written or highly formal spoken contexts, serving as a general contrasting conjunction. 「それでも」 is more versatile, carrying a nuance of persistence despite a specific condition."

            "nuance": "「それなのに」 often expresses a stronger sense of disappointment, grievance, or contradiction, especially when an expected outcome does not occur. 「それでも」 is more neutral, focusing on continuation despite a fact, without necessarily implying dissatisfaction."

            "term": "のに",
            "meaning": "Despite, although, even though",

            "nuance": "「のに」 implies a sense of regret, dissatisfaction, or an unexpected result, often when something should have happened but didn't, or vice-versa. For example, 「頑張ったのに、失敗した」 (Even though I worked hard, I failed, implying regret). 「それでも」 focuses on persistence or a surprising continuation, not necessarily regret."

            "nuance": "「くせに」 often carries a strong negative or reproachful tone, implying a moral judgment or criticism of someone's behavior. For example, 「知らないくせに、知ったかぶりをする」 (Even though you don't know, you pretend to know, implying blame). 「それでも」 is neutral and does not carry such a negative connotation."

            "nuance": "「ところが」 is used when the second clause presents a development that is contrary to what one would expect from the first, often implying an unexpected turn of events or a surprising discovery. While similar, 「それでも」 more strongly emphasizes perseverance or an unchanging state despite a prior condition."

            "nuance": "「それにしても」 often expresses a judgment or comment about something, acknowledging a prior fact but then adding a new, sometimes surprising, perspective or conclusion. For example, 「高かったけど、それにしても美味しかった」 (It was expensive, but even so, it was delicious). 「それでも」 focuses more on the continuation of an action or state despite a condition."

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「だって」 is a very casual and versatile expression. It often introduces a reason or an excuse, or can be used to soften a statement, or even as a simple conjunction meaning 'but' or 'even'. It does not carry the specific nuance of 'persistence despite an obstacle' that 「それでも」 does."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "These expressions all convey some form of contrast or concession, but they differ significantly in nuance and register. When choosing among them, consider whether you want to express persistence or a surprising outcome despite a preceding condition (「それでも」); disappointment or grievance (「それなのに」, 「のに」); criticism (「くせに」); a general contrast (「しかしながら」, 「ですが」); an unexpected turn (「ところが」); an evaluative comment (「それにしても」); or a casual reason/concession (「だって」).
