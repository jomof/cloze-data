    "etymology": "「それでも」is derived from 「それ」 (sore, that) + the particle 「でも」 (demo, even). Thus, it literally means \"even with that\". This etymology helps understand its usage in conveying that despite a certain fact or situation, something else is still true or valid.",
    "writeup": "「それでも」 is a conjunction used to express that something is true or will happen despite a previous statement or situation. It's similar to \"even so,\" \"nevertheless,\" or \"but still\" in English. It combines 「それ」 (that) with the particle 「でも」 (even), literally meaning \"even with that.\" Use 「それでも」 to introduce a surprising or contrasting piece of information. It indicates that the second statement holds true regardless of what was mentioned before.",
