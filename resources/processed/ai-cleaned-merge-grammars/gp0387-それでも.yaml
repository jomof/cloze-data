    "etymology": "「それでも」 is a combination of 「それ」 (that) and 「でも」 (even). Literally, it means \"even with that.\"",
    "writeup": "「それでも」 connects two phrases or sentences, A and B, to convey that despite the condition or information stated in A, B is still the case or will still happen. It inherently carries a nuance of surprise or unexpectedness, suggesting that the outcome in B occurs *even with* the preceding circumstance A. This makes it slightly different from a simple 'but' or 'however', as it emphasizes a situation where an action or state persists against expectations.\n\nWhile often translated as \"even so,\" \"nevertheless,\" or \"and yet,\" the literal sense, \"even with that,\" helps grasp its core meaning. It is used when a situation or feeling persists despite an opposing factor, or when a decision is made regardless of a difficulty.\n\nFor instance, if it is raining (A), but one decides to go fishing anyway (B), 「それでも」 captures that persistence. It highlights the speaker's resolve or the surprising reality of B in the face of A.",
