jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  usage-context: Used in polite speech for general statements, habitual actions, and future intentions.
  function: Indicates politeness and expresses present, future, or habitual actions.
  nuance: The -ます form is a fundamental politeness marker, making sentences sound respectful and appropriate
    for most social situations, especially with those of equal or higher status, or strangers. It avoids
    the directness of plain forms.
  counterpoint: Contrasts with dictionary (plain) forms, which are more casual and used among close friends
    or in informal writing. It is less formal than sonkeigo or kenjōgo.
  colocation: Always attaches to the stem of a verb. Can be followed by particles like か (question), よ
    (emphasis), ね (agreement-seeking).
  grammatical-role: Acts as an auxiliary verb, attaching to verb stems to convey politeness and tense/aspect.
  logical-flow: Presents actions or states in a polite, straightforward manner, suitable for general communication.
  temporal-flow: Primarily indicates non-past tense (present or future) and habitual actions. Can also
    indicate immediate future intentions when context allows.
  spatial-flow: No direct spatial implication, but the action itself might involve spatial movement as
    described by the main verb.
etymology: The origin of -ます is debated among linguists, but it is thought to derive from older auxiliary
  verbs like まらう (marau) or まゐらす (mairasu), which conveyed concepts of respect and offering. Over time,
  it simplified and grammaticized into its current form, becoming the primary marker of polite speech
  in modern Japanese.
writeup: |-
  The -ます form is the basic polite form for Japanese verbs. It is used to make statements or ask questions in a polite and respectful manner. This form is suitable for most everyday conversations, especially when speaking to people you don't know well, those older than you, or those in a higher position. It contrasts with the plain (dictionary) form, which is used in casual settings among close friends or family.

  To form the -ます form:
  *   **る-verbs (Ichidan verbs)**: Remove the final 「る」 and add 「ます」. For example, 食べる (taberu - to eat) becomes 食べます (tabemasu).
  *   **う-verbs (Godan verbs)**: Change the final 「う」 sound to its 「い」 equivalent in the hiragana column and add 「ます」. For example, 読む (yomu - to read) becomes 読みます (yomimasu); 買う (kau - to buy) becomes 買います (kaimasu); 書く (kaku - to write) becomes 書きます (kakimasu).

  **Important Considerations:**
  *   The -ます form covers both present and future tense, as well as habitual actions. The specific meaning depends on the context and accompanying time adverbs.
  *   While generally polite, it is not the highest level of politeness. For more formal or deferential situations, you would use honorifics (sonkeigo) or humble language (kenjōgo).
  *   The use of -ます can sometimes sound slightly stiff if overused in very casual settings with close friends. However, it is always grammatically correct and safe to use in most situations if you are unsure of the appropriate level of politeness.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[dictionary] (dictionary form)
    meaning: Plain non-past form of a verb
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The dictionary form is the plain, casual form of a verb, used among close friends or in informal
      contexts, whereas the -ます form is polite and suitable for broader social situations. We are focusing
      on polite speech here.
    grammar_point: Verb[dictionary] (dictionary form)
  - term: Verb[て]いる (ongoing state・habitual action・resultant state)
    meaning: Indicates an action in progress, a continuous state, or a habitual action.
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While the -ます form can express habitual actions, the -て いる form specifically emphasizes an
      *ongoing* state or a continuous action. We are covering the general polite non-past.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[て]いる (ongoing state・habitual action・resultant state)
  - term: でしょう (probably・right?)
    meaning: Expresses probability or seeks agreement, usually in a polite manner.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: The -ます form states a fact or intention politely. 「でしょう」 adds a nuance of conjecture or seeks
      confirmation, implying a degree of uncertainty or shared understanding. They are not interchangeable
      in meaning.
    grammar_point: だろう・でしょう (probably・right?)
  - term: Verb[ます] (polite present) + とき
    meaning: When (something happens/is happening)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This structure specifies a time. The -ます form itself does not inherently specify a time; it
      is a tense/politeness marker for the verb.
    grammar_point: とき (when)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the core function of the -ます form as a politeness marker, rather
  than a specific tense or nuance marker, is key. It's often compared to the plain form, but it's important
  to remember that it's a separate grammatical conjugation, not just a more formal version of the plain
  form. While it implies non-past (present or future) actions, adding other grammatical structures like
  「～ている」 or 「～とき」 will introduce additional meanings that the basic -ます form does not inherently carry.
  Always consider the full grammatical pattern when determining the precise meaning.
examples:
  - english: I eat rice every day.
    japanese:
      - 毎日、ご飯 を {食べ ます}。
      - 毎日、ご飯 を {食べ ます} ね。
      - 毎日、ご飯 を {食べ ます} よ。
      - 毎日、ご飯 を {食べ ます} から。
      - 毎日、ご飯 を {食べ ます} わ。
      - 毎日、ご飯 を {食べ ます} もん。
    english_literally: Every day, rice, will eat.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 毎日、ご飯 を {食べる}。
        english: I eat rice every day (plain form).
        hint: The `ます` form indicates a polite register, which is hinted at by the general statement of
          habit without specific intimate context, steering away from the plain form.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 毎日、ご飯 を {食べ} て いる。
        english: I am eating/have been eating rice every day (habitual state).
        hint: While 「～ている」 can express habitual actions, the `ます` form here is a straightforward polite
          statement of a routine, without emphasizing the continuous nature.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 毎日、パン を {買い} ます。
        english: I buy bread every day.
        hint: 「買う」 (kau) is an う-verb, and its polite form is 「買います」. This conjugation pattern is different
          from る-verbs like 「食べる」, which becomes 「食べます」 by simply dropping 「る」 and adding 「ます」. We are
          looking for the polite form of a る-verb.
    scene: A woman describing her daily routine.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female

      informative context, maintaining a respectful tone.

    english_literally: As for the report, by tomorrow, I will write.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - レポート は 明日 まで に {書く}。
        english: I will write the report by tomorrow (plain).
        hint: The `ます` form indicates polite intent suitable for a slightly more formal or respectful
          setting, rather than a casual statement with a close friend.
      - competing_japanese:
          - レポート は 明日 まで に {書ける}。
        english: I can write the report by tomorrow.
        hint: This emphasizes ability, not a direct statement of future action. We're looking for a simple
          polite statement of intent to write.
    scene: A student politely tells their professor their plan to finish an assignment.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)

          - 彼 は 日本 語 を {覚え た}。
        english: He memorized Japanese (plain).
        hint: The polite past form is used when reporting information respectfully, even if the event
          itself is casual. The plain form would be used if speaking very casually to a close friend.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 日本 語 を {覚え} て いる。
        english: He has memorized Japanese (state of having memorized).
        hint: The polite past form emphasizes the completion of the action in the past. 「～ている」 describes
          the current state resulting from that action, which is different from simply reporting a past
          event.
    scene: A man formally reporting someone's recent accomplishment to a senior colleague.

    conjugation: past polite (～ました)

      - competing_japanese:
          - もう {忘れ た}？
        english: Did you already forget? (casual).
        hint: The polite 「ましたか」 indicates a polite inquiry, suitable for a more formal or less intimate
          conversation than the plain form.
    scene: A woman reminding a man about something they discussed, maintaining a polite distance.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: interrogative
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    speaker_gender: female

          - シャワー を {浴び} て さっぱり {し た}。
        english: I took a shower and feel refreshed (plain).
        hint: The use of 「しました」 at the end sets a polite tone for the entire sentence, even with the te-form,
          suggesting a slightly more formal reflection.
      - competing_japanese:
          - シャワー を {浴びる} と、さっぱり {し ます}。
        english: When I take a shower, I feel refreshed (general condition).

          or habitual outcome.

    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The use of the te-form 「浴びて」 connects the actions, and the polite ending 「さっぱりしました」 indicates
      a reflective statement in a polite register. This is suitable for a male speaker conveying his feeling
      in a general context or to someone he isn't intimately close with. The presence of both ます and ました
      forms in the example highlights the flexibility of the structure with different tenses, while maintaining

          - 彼女 の 笑顔 を {見 たい} な。
        english: I want to see her smile.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 早く {起きろ}。
        english: Wake up early tomorrow! (plain imperative).
        hint: The use of 「なさい」 provides a polite but firm command, suitable for a parent-child interaction
          where respect is maintained but the command is direct, unlike the harsh plain imperative.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 早く {起き} て ください。
        english: Please wake up early tomorrow (polite request).
        hint: While 「～てください」 is a polite request, 「～なさい」 conveys more authority and directness, which
          fits the scene of a parent giving a clear instruction.
    scene: A parent giving a direct instruction to a child.
    register: meirei-kei no teineigo (polite imperative)

          applied to any verb.

          - 先生 が {褒め} て くれ まし た。
        english: My teacher praised me (with favor verb, polite).
        hint: The original uses the passive voice to emphasize receiving the action. 「～て くれ まし た」 uses

      describing her actions as a parent in a respectful manner, typical for a conversation with another

post_example_writeup: The -ます form is crucial for polite communication in Japanese. Remember that it functions
  as both a present and future tense marker, and its use is fundamental to sounding natural and respectful
  in a wide range of social interactions. Pay attention to how it interacts with different verb types
  (る-verbs vs. う-verbs) for correct conjugation, and practice using it in various contexts.
