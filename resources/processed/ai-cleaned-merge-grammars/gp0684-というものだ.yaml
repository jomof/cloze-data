        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "semi-formal",
        "usage-context": "General usage",
        "function": "To provide a definitive statement or conclusion based on the speaker's observation or commonly held belief.",
        "nuance": "Conveys a sense of inherent truth, essential characteristic, or a strong, often judgmental, opinion about something's nature. Can imply criticism depending on context."
    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point is derived from と (to), a particle indicating content or quotation; いう (iu, to say); もの (mono, thing); and だ (da, a copula). The literal sense is akin to 'it is a thing that is said,' which has evolved to express the speaker's understanding or definition of something based on their experience or judgment. It emphasizes that the speaker perceives something as fundamentally true or inherently characteristic.",
    "writeup": "「というものだ」 is a powerful expression used to convey the speaker's strong impression, conviction, or definition of something. It often translates to phrases like \"that's the way things are,\" \"that's what it means to be...\", or \"that's simply X.\" The speaker presents their understanding as a general truth or a commonly accepted idea, often with a sense of authority or definitive judgment. It highlights the essential nature or a characteristic deemed fundamental.\n\nThis pattern can be used in various situations:\n*   **To state a general truth or principle:** Defining what something inherently is.\n*   **To express a definition or an essential characteristic:** Describing the core quality of a person, concept, or action.\n*   **To convey a critique or disappointment:** When used with negative connotations, it can imply that a situation or action falls short of what is expected or ideal, carrying a tone of mild criticism or disapproval.\n\nWhile 「というものだ」 is quite direct, its specific nuance (whether it's a neutral observation or criticism) depends heavily on the surrounding context. In casual conversation, 「という」 may be shortened to 「って」, as in 「ってものだ」, without any change in meaning, adding a more colloquial feel.",

            "meaning": "is (a noun)",
            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While both 『Noun + だ』 and 『Noun + というものだ』 can express a state of being or a definition, 『Noun + だ』 is a simple, direct copula. 『Noun + というものだ』, however, adds a stronger nuance of the speaker's definitive judgment, conviction, or a statement about the inherent nature or widely accepted truth of something. It often conveys a sense of 'that's just what X means' or 'that's how X truly is,' implying a deeper understanding or a firm conclusion about the noun's essence."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "When choosing between 『Noun + だ』 and 『Noun + というものだ』, consider the degree of conviction and the type of statement you wish to make. If you are simply stating a fact, 『だ』 is sufficient. If you want to convey a strong opinion, a definitive statement about an inherent quality, or a generally accepted truth, 『というものだ』 or its casual form 『ってものだ』 is more appropriate. The latter emphasizes the speaker's interpretive conclusion about the nature of the noun.",
