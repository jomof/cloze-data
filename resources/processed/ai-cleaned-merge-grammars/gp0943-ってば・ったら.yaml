    "etymology": "ってば and ったら are contractions of と言えば ('if it were said') and と言ったら ('if it were said') respectively, implying that something has already been stated or should be obvious.",
    "writeup": "「ってば」 and 「ったら」 are used in casual Japanese to strongly assert the speaker's viewpoint or opinion, often conveying frustration or insistence. They are frequently translated as \"I said (A)!\" or \"I told you (A)!\". These forms are contractions of 「と言えば」 ('if it were said') and 「と言ったら」 ('if it were said'). The implied nuance is similar to the English \"Didn't I say (A)?!\" when used in a sarcastic or aggressive manner.\n\nThese expressions can follow most words in their plain form. However, when following nouns or な-adjectives, they typically require 「だ」 to precede them. For instance, 「大人だってば」 (I said I'm an adult!).\n\nThere is a specific usage where 「ってば」 or 「ったら」 directly follow a noun without 「だ」. In such cases, the noun usually refers to a person, often someone the speaker is very familiar with. This construction expresses a certain level of annoyance, exasperation, or even playful frustration, similar to \"Oh, that darn (A)\" or \"(A), you always do that!\". For example, 「金太郎ってば」 (That darn Kintaro) implies a habitual or annoying characteristic of Kintaro.",
