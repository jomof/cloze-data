    "etymology": "These expressions originate from contractions of 「といえば」 ('if it were said') and 「といったら」 ('if you were to say').",
    "writeup": "「ってば」 and 「ったら」 are used in casual Japanese to strongly assert the speaker's viewpoint or opinion. They translate to \"I said (A)!\" or \"I told you (A)!\", similar to the sarcastic or aggressive English \"Didn't I say (A)?!\"\n\nEither 「ってば」 or 「ったら」 can follow almost any word, but nouns and *na*-adjectives require 「だ」 before them. \n\nHowever, 「ってば」 and 「ったら」 can also directly follow nouns, usually referring to a person, expressing playful or genuine frustration with someone familiar, translating to \"Oh, that (A)\" or \"That darn (A)\".",
