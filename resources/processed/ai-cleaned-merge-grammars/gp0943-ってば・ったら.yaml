    "etymology": "ってば and ったら are contractions of と言えば ('if it were said') and と言ったら ('if it were said') respectively. This construction adds emphasis or annoyance to a statement, implying that something has already been said or should be obvious.",
    "writeup": "ってば and ったら are used in casual Japanese to emphasize the speaker's viewpoint or express frustration. They translate to \"I said (A)!\" or \"I told you (A)!\". The literal meaning is similar to the English \"Didn't I say (A)?!\" used sarcastically or aggressively.\n\nEither ってば or ったら can follow most words, but nouns and な-adjectives require だ before them.  However, nouns referring to people (often the speaker) can directly precede ってば or ったら, expressing frustration or familiarity, like \"Oh, that darn (A)\".",
