        "function": "To emphasize the speaker's assertion or frustration; to express familiar annoyance towards a person.",

    "etymology": "ってば and ったら are contractions of と言えば ('if it were said') and と言ったら ('if it were said') respectively, implying that something has already been stated or should be obvious.",
    "writeup": "In casual Japanese, 「ってば」 and 「ったら」 are used to emphatically assert the speaker's viewpoint or opinion, often conveying a sense of frustration or insistence. They are frequently translated as \"I said (A)!\" or \"I told you (A)!\". These forms are contractions of 「と言えば」 and 「と言ったら」, which originally meant \"if it were said\". The implied nuance is similar to the English \"Didn't I say (A)?!\" when used in a slightly exasperated or insistent tone. These expressions are typically used when the speaker feels their previous statement or a commonly known fact is being ignored or challenged. 「ってば」 and 「ったら」 can follow most words in their plain form. However, when used after nouns or な-adjectives, they typically require 「だ」 to precede them, forming structures like 「大人だってば」 (I said I'm an adult!) or 「嫌いだってば」 (I said I dislike it!). There is a special use case where 「ってば」 or 「ったら」 directly follow a noun, usually referring to a person, without the preceding 「だ」. In this context, the grammar point conveys a specific nuance of familiar annoyance, exasperation, or even playful frustration directed towards that person. This usage is common among close family members or friends, especially from older speakers to younger ones, expressing sentiments akin to \"Oh, that darn (person)!\" or \"(Person), you always do that!\" It highlights a recurring habit or trait that the speaker finds mildly irritating or amusing.",

            "nuance": "While basic sentence-final particles can add nuance, they generally lack the strong, exasperated insistence or the 'I told you so' feeling that 「ってば」 or 「ったら」 convey. These expressions imply a pre-existing statement or ignored fact.",
