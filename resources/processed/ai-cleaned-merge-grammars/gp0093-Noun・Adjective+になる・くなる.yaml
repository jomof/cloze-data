    "etymology": "「に」 is a particle indicating a direction or target of change, and 「なる」 is the verb \"to become.\" 「くなる」 is the conjugation of the verb 「なる」 specifically used with い-adjectives to indicate a change in the degree of that adjective.",
    "writeup": "「になる」 (with nouns and な-adjectives) and 「くなる」 (with い-adjectives) express the idea of \"becoming.\" It describes a change in state, condition, or quality. The form of 「なる」 can be adjusted to indicate different tenses (past, present, future) or polarity (positive, negative). For example, you can say something *will become*, *is becoming*, or *has become* something else.\n\n*   For **い-adjectives**, drop the い and add 「くなる」. Example: 「大きい」 (big) becomes 「大きくなる」 (to become big).\n*   For **な-adjectives** and **nouns**, add 「になる」. Example: 「元気」 (healthy) becomes 「元気**に**なる」 (to become healthy).\n\nThere is an exception: the adjective 「いい」 (good) conjugates to 「よくなる」, not 「いくなる」.",
