        "function": "expresses a change of state or condition",
        "nuance": "implies a natural or resulting transformation, rather than a conscious effort or active becoming, though it can be used for both. It highlights the outcome of a process or a spontaneous shift in state or quality. The choice between になる and くなる depends on the part of speech being modified, reflecting the grammatical rules for nouns/na-adjectives and i-adjectives respectively. The irregular conjugation of 「いい」 to 「よくなる」 is a notable exception. While the base form is casual, it can be easily adapted to polite or formal speech by conjugating 'なる' (e.g., 'になります', 'になりました')."
    },
    "etymology": "「に」 is a particle indicating a direction or target of change, signifying the result or state something transforms into. 「なる」 is the foundational verb \"to become\" in Japanese. 「くなる」 is a specific grammatical conjugation used exclusively with い-adjectives to indicate a change in their degree or state. This conjugation pattern is derived from the adverbial form of い-adjectives (dropping い and adding く), which then precedes 「なる」 to denote the shift.",
    "writeup": "「になる」 (with nouns and な-adjectives) and 「くなる」 (with い-adjectives) both express the idea of \"becoming.\" This grammar point describes a change in state, condition, or quality. The verb 「なる」 can be conjugated to indicate different tenses (past, present, future) or polarity (positive, negative). While the dictionary form is casual, it can be easily adapted to polite or formal speech by conjugating 'なる' (e.g., 'になります', 'になりました').\n\n*   For **い-adjectives**, you drop the final 「い」 and add 「くなる」. For example, 「大きい」 (big) becomes 「大きくなる」 (to become big).\n*   For **な-adjectives** and **nouns**, you add 「になる」. For example, 「元気」 (healthy) becomes 「元気**に**なる」 (to become healthy).\n\nThere is a notable exception: the i-adjective 「いい」 (good) conjugates irregularly to 「よくなる」, not 「いくなる」.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "While both 「になる/くなる」 and 「てくる」 can express a change, 「てくる」 often emphasizes the process or gradual nature of the change over time, or a change that happened from somewhere else to here. 「になる/くなる」 simply indicates the end state or the result of a change."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「になる/くなる」 focuses on the resulting state of a transformation, 「てくる」 often highlights the progression toward that state or a change that has manifested itself.

            "nuance": "This example uses the casual form 「なる」 appropriate for a young male speaker talking to a friend about future plans. The use of 「になる」 emphasizes the definitive transition to a new status.",

            "nuance": "The combination of 「に なる」 with 「と」 indicates a natural consequence or recurring phenomenon. 「暑く なる」 specifically highlights the change in temperature as a result of summer's arrival, rather than the gradual feeling of it getting hotter.",
            "etymology": "The 「と」 particle, when connected with a verb, often implies a natural or inevitable result, which complements the sense of transformation conveyed by 「なる」. The adverbial form 「暑く」 stems from the i-adjective 「暑い」, maintaining the adjectival meaning while allowing it to modify the verb 「なる」."

The formal register suits the technical and professional setting.",
            "etymology": "「ほど」 is a particle derived from a noun meaning 'extent' or 'degree', and when used with a verb it indicates that an action or state progresses in proportion to another. 「便利に」 is the adverbial form of the na-adjective 「便利だ」, allowing it to modify the verb 「なる」 and convey the manner in which it becomes convenient."

            "nuance": "The phrase 「歌手 に なる こと」 literally means 'the act of becoming a singer', highlighting the process and transformation inherent in achieving her dream. This indicates a strong personal aspiration rather than a simple statement of current profession or desire. The use of 「です」 adds a slight formality and certainty to the statement, even in a casual conversation among friends.",
            "etymology": "「こと」 is a nominalizer here, turning the phrase 「歌手 に なる」 (to become a singer) into a noun phrase, making it possible to be the subject of 'her dream is...'. This grammatical structure allows for abstract concepts and actions to be treated as concrete nouns."

The past tense 「なった」 clearly indicates that this change has already occurred and is a result of the exam's completion. The casual register reflects the informal context of a student sharing personal feelings.",
            "etymology": "The te-form 「終わって」 connects the completion of the exam to the subsequent change in mood, creating a causal sequence. 「楽に」 is the adverbial form of the na-adjective 「楽だ」, allowing it to describe the manner of becoming."

This phrasing is direct and informative, suitable for a medical explanation, maintaining a semi-formal tone with the casual 「だ」 or polite 「です」 ending for 「はず」.",
            "etymology": "The 「と」 particle here functions similarly to an 'if-then' conditional, indicating that the action of taking the medicine leads to the non-occurrence of sleepiness. 「眠く」 is the adverbial form of the i-adjective 「眠い」, allowing it to modify the negative form of 「なる」."

The 「だろう」 or 「でしょう」 adds a strong sense of probability and warning, making the coach's statement impactful. This is a common way for an older male to express a negative outcome as a consequence of inaction, conveying seriousness and authority. The formal register is fitting for a coach's address.",
            "etymology": "「できなくなる」 is formed from the potential form 「できる」 (to be able to do) and the negative form 「ない」, which then conjugates with 「なる」 to show a change into a state of inability. This construction is very precise in conveying the meaning of 'to become unable to do something'."

The nuance is a direct observation of the resulting state.",
            "etymology": "The te-form 「なって」 indicates a sequence of events or a cause-and-effect relationship, allowing the first clause (night arriving) to lead into the second (temperature changing). 「涼しく」 is the adverbial form of the i-adjective 「涼しい」, which then modifies the verb 「なる」."
