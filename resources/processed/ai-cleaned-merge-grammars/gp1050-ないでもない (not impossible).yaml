    is 'a little (A)' or 'kinda (A)'.
jlpt: N1
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: general use
  function: expresses hesitant affirmation or possibility
  nuance: implies a subtle, often reluctant, agreement or partial truth; a double negative that softens
    direct affirmation or denial.
  colocation: Often used with words indicating a degree or possibility, such as 少し (a little), 一理 (some
    truth), 可能性 (possibility).
etymology: The grammar point 「ないでもない」 is formed by negating a negative, literally meaning "not not be."
  This double negative construction creates a nuance of hesitant affirmation or possibility, suggesting
  that while something might not be entirely true or false, there is a degree of truth or possibility.
  It's akin to saying 'it's not impossible' or 'it's not that I don't...'.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point 「ないでもない」, literally meaning "not not be," expresses a hesitant affirmation, possibility, or mild agreement. It indicates that something is "kind of," "might be," or "somewhat" true. Think of it as a way of saying you don't completely disagree, or that you see a possibility, however slight. This grammar point is often used in situations where the speaker can neither fully confirm nor deny something, or when they want to express a nuanced agreement without being overly direct. It is primarily used in casual settings.

  It is formed by attaching 「ないでもない」 to the negative form of a verb (e.g., 行かない + ないでもない → 行かないでもない) or an adjective (e.g., できない + ないでもない → できないでもない). While it creates a double negative, the overall meaning leans towards a cautious positive. For instance, 「分からないでもない」 doesn't mean 'I don't understand' but rather 'I kind of understand' or 'it's not that I don't understand'.

  「なくもない」 is an interchangeable variation, though it is less frequently used. Both structures are fundamentally similar in their nuanced expression of possibility or reluctant agreement.
false_friends:
  - term: といってもいい
    meaning: You could say, You might say
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「ないでもない」 which conveys a hesitant or reluctant possibility, 「といってもいい」 suggests a stronger
      degree of affirmation or justification. It proposes an alternative description that's reasonably
      accurate and more confidently stated.
    grammar_point: といってもいい (you could say)
  - term: ないことはない
    meaning: It's not that...doesn't happen; It's not impossible
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ないことはない」 is used to state that something is not 100% impossible or that an event does occur,
      perhaps infrequently. It implies a denial of complete absence or impossibility. In contrast, 「ないでもない」
      is more commonly used to express a hesitant opinion or partial agreement, suggesting 'it's not that
      I don't (agree/understand/etc.)' rather than just 'it's not impossible.'
    grammar_point: ないことはない (not impossible)
  - term: わけではない
    meaning: It's not that..., It doesn't mean that...
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「わけではない」 explicitly denies a particular interpretation or assumption, stating that something
      is not necessarily true or entirely the case. It is a direct negation of a presumed state. In contrast,
      「ないでもない」 is a double negative that implies a hesitant affirmation or a mild, often reluctant, agreement
      or possibility. It hints at a subtle presence or possibility rather than denying a broad assumption.
    grammar_point: わけではない (not necessarily)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「ないでもない」 implies a subtle agreement or possibility, often with a hint of reservation.
  「といってもいい」 is used to rephrase or suggest an alternative, reasonably accurate description. 「ないことはない」
  means that something is not entirely impossible or doesn't occur, denying a complete absence. 「わけではない」
  explicitly denies a complete interpretation or assumption, indicating something is not necessarily true
  in all aspects.
examples:
  - english: This new restaurant, the taste isn't bad, but it's a bit expensive.
    japanese:
      - この 新しい レストラン、味 は 悪く {ない で も ない} けど、ちょっと 高い な。
      - この 新しい レストラン、味 は 悪く {なく も ない} けど、ちょっと 高い な。
    english_literally: This new restaurant, as for the taste, it's not not bad, but it's a bit expensive.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 新しい レストラン、味 は 悪く ない けど、ちょっと 高い な。
        english: This new restaurant, the taste isn't bad, but it's a bit expensive.
        hint: Using a direct negative like 「悪くない」 simply means 'not bad'. 「ないでもない」 adds a layer of hesitation
          or reluctant agreement, implying 'it's not *not* bad', suggesting a more nuanced, understated
          compliment. We're looking for that subtle reservation.
    scene: Two friends are discussing a new restaurant they tried, balancing a positive comment with a
      drawback.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    nuance: Here, 「悪くないでもない」 implies 'it's not *not* bad', suggesting a reluctant or understated compliment
      rather than a direct statement of 'not bad'. The speaker acknowledges a good point, but with reservation,
      perhaps implying it's not *great* or that other factors (like cost) weigh on the overall impression.
  - english: That proposal, I'm not entirely unable to understand it, but I think it'll be difficult to
      implement.
    japanese:
      - その 提案、全く 理解 でき {ない で も ない} けど、実行 は 難しい と 思う。
      - その 提案、全く 理解 でき {ない で も ない} が、実行 は 難しい と 思う。
      - その 提案、全く 理解 でき {なく も ない} けど、実行 は 難しい と 思う。
      - その 提案、全く 理解 でき {なく も ない} が、実行 は 難しい と 思う。
    english_literally: That proposal, entirely to understand it, it's not not possible, but to implement
      it, I think it is difficult.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 提案、全く 理解 できる けど、実行 は 難しい と 思う。
        english: That proposal, I can completely understand it, but I think it'll be difficult to implement.
        hint: The core grammar here suggests a hesitant or partial understanding, not a full, direct one.
          We're looking for the phrase that conveys 'it's not that I *can't* understand,' implying a degree
          of reservation.
    scene: A project manager is giving feedback on a team member's new proposal, acknowledging its theoretical
      basis while highlighting practical challenges.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: The phrase 「理解できないでもない」 conveys a hesitant understanding, meaning 'it's not that I *can't*
      understand'. It's a polite way to acknowledge the idea's validity without fully endorsing it, which
      is typical in professional settings when giving nuanced feedback. It softens what might otherwise
      be perceived as a direct criticism of the proposal's feasibility.
  - english: His new haircut isn't exactly strange, but his previous one suited him better.
    japanese:
      - 彼 の 新しい 髪型、別 に 変 じゃ {ない で も ない} けど、前 の ほう が 似合っ て い た な。
      - 彼 の 新しい 髪型、別 に 変 じゃ {なく も ない} けど、前 の ほう が 似合っ て い た な。
    english_literally: His new haircut, it's not not strange, but the previous one suited him more.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 新しい 髪型、別 に 変 じゃ ない けど、前 の ほう が 似合っ て い た な。
        english: His new haircut isn't particularly strange, but his previous one suited him better.
        hint: While 「変じゃない」 directly states 'it's not strange,' the grammar point implies 'it's not *not*
          strange,' suggesting a subtle hint of strangeness or a 'backhanded compliment.' We're looking
          for that nuanced, indirect criticism.
    scene: Two friends are gossiping about a mutual acquaintance's new look, offering a backhanded compliment.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: The phrase 「変じゃないでもない」 implies 'it's not *not* strange', which is a roundabout way of saying
      'it's a little strange' or 'it's not entirely normal'. This is often used by female speakers in
      casual conversation, especially when offering a subtle critique or backhanded compliment, avoiding
      direct negative confrontation while still conveying a reserved opinion.
  - english: His method is a bit rough, but since he's getting results, there's some truth to it.
    japanese:
      - 彼 の やり 方 は 少し 乱暴 だ けど、結果 を 出し て いる から、一理 {ない で も ない}。
      - 彼 の やり 方 は 少し 乱暴 だ けど、結果 を 出し て いる から、一理 {ない で も ない} です。
      - 彼 の やり 方 は 少し 乱暴 だ けど、結果 を 出し て いる から、一理 {なく も ない}。
      - 彼 の やり 方 は 少し 乱暴 だ けど、結果 を 出し て いる から、一理 {なく も ない} です.
    english_literally: His method is a bit rough, but since he's yielding results, one truth isn't not
      present.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の やり 方 は 少し 乱暴 だ けど、結果 を 出し て いる から、一理 ある。
        english: His method is a bit rough, but since he's getting results, there's a point to it.
        hint: The grammar point expresses a hesitant or reluctant agreement ('there is *not not* a point'),
          implying some reservation despite acknowledging a point. A direct 「一理ある」 would be a straightforward
          agreement. We're looking for that nuanced, partial agreement.
    scene: Colleagues are discussing an unconventional but successful team member, acknowledging their
      effectiveness despite reservations about their style.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: For a male speaker in a professional setting, 「一理ないでもない」 is a sophisticated way to acknowledge
      validity while still expressing reservations. It implies 'there is *not not* a point/truth to it,'
      meaning 'there is some truth to it,' but the double negative hints at a reluctant or partial agreement.
      This allows the speaker to maintain a balanced perspective, recognizing success despite a flawed
      process.
  - english: This plan isn't perfect, but there's a possibility it could succeed.
    japanese:
      - この 計画 は 完璧 で は ない けれど、成功 する 可能 性 は {ない で も ない} です。
      - この 計画 は 完璧 で は ない けれど、成功 する 可能 性 は {なく も ない} です。
    english_literally: This plan isn't perfect, but to succeed, the possibility is not not present.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 計画 は 完璧 で は ない けれど、成功 する 可能 性 は ある。
        english: This plan isn't perfect, but there is a possibility it could succeed.
        hint: The grammar point conveys a cautious optimism ('it's not *not* possible'), a softer assertion
          of possibility than a direct 「可能性はある」. We're looking for the phrase that implies possibility
          while acknowledging limitations or challenges.
    scene: A team leader is trying to motivate their team despite challenges, offering a cautious but
      hopeful assessment of a new project.
    register: formal
    setting: persuasive
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: When a female team leader uses 「可能性はないでもない」, it implies 'it's not *not* possible,' conveying
      a cautious optimism. This phrasing is less direct than stating 'there is a possibility' and allows
      for a more nuanced expression of hope, acknowledging challenges while still providing motivation
      without overpromising. It's a persuasive technique that manages expectations.
  - english: There are some points in his new opinion that are worth listening to.
    japanese:
      - 彼 の 新しい 意見 に は、聞く べき ところ が {なく も ない}。
      - 彼 の 新しい 意見 に は、聞く べき ところ が {なく も ない} です。
      - 彼 の 新しい 意見 に は、聞く べき ところ が {ない で も ない}。
      - 彼 の 新しい 意見 に は、聞く べき ところ が {ない で も ない} です。
    english_literally: As for his new opinion, there isn't not a place that should be heard.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 新しい 意見 に は、聞く べき ところ が ある。
        english: There are some points in his new opinion that are worth listening to.
        hint: The grammar point 「なくもない」 offers a reluctant concession or subtle acknowledgement ('it's
          not *not* present'), implying merit despite overall reservations. A direct 「聞くべきところがある」 would
          be a straightforward assertion. We're looking for the phrase that allows for subtle agreement
          with reservation.
    scene: Two colleagues are discussing a recent, controversial presentation, acknowledging some merit
      despite overall skepticism.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The phrase 「なくもない」 (a variant of 「ないでもない」) indicates 'it's not *not* present' or 'there isn't
      *not* X'. Used by a male speaker, it conveys a subtle concession or reluctant acknowledgment of
      value, especially in a serious discussion where direct agreement might be perceived as too strong
      or uncritical. It suggests finding some merit despite overall reservations.
  - english: It's not that I can't go to the party, but I'm really tired tonight.
    japanese:
      - パーティー に 行か {ない で も ない} ん だ けど、今日 は 本当 に 疲れ て て。
      - パーティー に 行か {なく も ない} ん だ けど、今日 は 本当 に 疲れ て て。
    english_literally: As for the party, it's not not going, but today I'm really tired.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - パーティー に 行け ない けど、今日 は 本当 に 疲れ て て。
          - パーティー に 行く 気 は ない けど、今日 は 本当 に 疲れ て て。
        english: I can't go to the party, but I'm really tired tonight.
        hint: 「行けない」 is a direct statement of inability to go. 「行かないでもない」 implies a slight possibility
          or reluctance to say 'no' directly, conveying 'it's not that I *can't* go' or 'I wouldn't *not*
          go'. We're looking for that subtle reluctance or indirectness.
    scene: A friend asks you to a party, and you're contemplating whether to go, feeling torn between
      social obligation and tiredness.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: In casual conversation, especially among friends, 「行かないでもない」 softens a potential refusal.
      A female speaker might use this to express that while there's a reason not to go (tiredness), she's
      not entirely dismissing the idea, making the response less abrupt or firm. This shows consideration
      for the friend's invitation.
  - english: It's not that I don't understand your frustration, but we need to find a solution.
    japanese:
      - 君 の 苛立ち が 分 から {ない で も ない} が、解決 策 を 見つけ なけれ ば なら ない。
      - 君 の 苛立ち が 分 から {ない で も ない} です が、解決 策 を 見つけ なけれ ば なら ない。
      - 君 の 苛立ち が 分 から {なく も ない} が、解決 策 を 見つけ なけれ ば なら ない。
      - 君 の 苛立ち が 分 から {なく も ない} です が、解決 策 を 見つけ なけれ ば なら ない。
    english_literally: As for your frustration, it's not not understanding, but a solution must be found.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 君 の 苛立ち は よく 分かる が、解決 策 を 見つけ なけれ ば なら ない。
        english: I fully understand your frustration, but we need to find a solution.
        hint: 「よく分かる」 indicates full understanding. The grammar point implies a partial or hesitant understanding,
          meaning 'it's not that I *don't* understand' but with a nuance of 'I understand *somewhat*'
          or 'I can see why you feel that way'. We're looking for that empathetic but slightly reserved
          acknowledgement.
    scene: A manager speaks to an upset employee, attempting to de-escalate the situation by acknowledging
      their feelings while steering the conversation towards problem-solving.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: An older male speaker using 「分からないでもない」 towards a frustrated employee offers a delicate balance.
      It implies 'it's not that I *don't* understand', showing empathy without fully agreeing with or
      validating the frustration, which could be counterproductive. This nuanced phrasing allows for a
      professional and empathetic approach while maintaining authority and focusing on solutions.
  - english: It's not that he can't make mistakes, but he's usually very careful.
    japanese:
      - 彼 が 間違え {ない で も ない} が、普段 は とても 慎重 な ん です。
      - 彼 が 間違え {ない で も ない} です が、普段 は とても 慎重 な ん です。
      - 彼 が 間違え {なく も ない} が、普段 は とても 慎重 な ん です。
      - 彼 が 間違え {なく も ない} です が、普段 は とても 慎重 な ん です。
    english_literally: As for him, it's not not making mistakes, but usually he is very careful.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 も 間違える こと は ある が、普段 は とても 慎重 な ん です。
          - 彼 が 間違える はず は ない が、普段 は とても 慎重 な ん です。
        english: He can also make mistakes, but he's usually very careful.
        hint: 「間違えることもある」 directly states the possibility of making mistakes. The grammar point means
          'it's not that he *doesn't* make mistakes', acknowledging the universal human possibility of
          error while emphasizing a strong tendency towards carefulness. We're looking for the phrase
          that subtly concedes a possibility but highlights an opposing characteristic.
    scene: Two colleagues are discussing a highly competent, but not infallible, team member's work ethic.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: A female speaker might use 「間違えないでもない」 in a professional setting to provide a balanced assessment
      of a colleague. It acknowledges that even a careful person is not immune to error ('it's not that
      he *doesn't* make mistakes'), while immediately following up with their usual diligence. This careful
      phrasing avoids over-idealizing the colleague while still praising them.
  - english: It's not that we don't have enough budget, but it will be a tight squeeze for this project.
    japanese:
      - 予算 が 足り {ない で も ない} ん です が、この プロジェクト に は かなり 厳しい です ね。
      - 予算 が 足り {なく も ない} ん です が、この プロジェクト に は かなり 厳しい です ね。
    english_literally: As for budget, it's not not enough, but for this project, it's quite tight, isn't
      it?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 予算 は 足りる ん です が、この プロジェクト に は かなり 厳しい です ね。
          - 予算 が 足りる か どう か 分かり ませ ん が、この プロジェクト に は かなり 厳しい です ね。
        english: We have enough budget, but it will be quite tight for this project.
        hint: 「予算は足りる」 implies a clear sufficiency of budget. The grammar point implies that the budget
          *technically* exists, but with significant constraints, meaning 'it's not that there *isn't*
          enough budget, but...' We're looking for the expression that conveys this delicate balance of
          'just enough' with difficulty.
    scene: During a project meeting, a team member explains the financial reality of an ambitious project,
      confirming funds exist but with reservations.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: cautious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: A male speaker in a professional setting might use 「足りないでもない」 to convey a cautious assessment
      of resources. It implies 'it's not that we *don't* have enough budget', acknowledging the bare minimum
      is met, but immediately qualifies it with the difficulty. This phrase is useful for managing expectations
      and subtly suggesting potential challenges without directly stating a lack of resources.
post_example_writeup: As you can see, 「ないでもない」 and its variant 「なくもない」 are incredibly versatile. They
  allow speakers to convey subtle agreements, reluctant possibilities, or nuanced evaluations without
  committing to an absolute positive or negative. Mastering this double-negative construction will significantly
  enhance your ability to express complex thoughts and feelings in Japanese, particularly in situations
  requiring diplomacy or careful phrasing.
