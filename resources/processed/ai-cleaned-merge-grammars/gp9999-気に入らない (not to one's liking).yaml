jlpt: N3
etymology: 「気に入る」is a compound verb derived from「気 (ki)」meaning "spirit, mind, feeling" and「入る (iru)」meaning
  "to enter." Thus, literally, it means "to enter one's spirit or mind," implying that something fits
  well with one's feelings or preferences. The negative form「気に入らない」means it does not enter one's mind,
  or does not resonate well with one's feelings.
writeup: |-
  「気に入らない」is a common Japanese expression used to convey that something or someone does not meet one's personal preferences, standards, or expectations. It signifies a subjective sense of dislike, displeasure, or dissatisfaction. While often translated as "I don't like it," it carries a more nuanced meaning of something not "sitting right" with one's feelings or taste. It is commonly applied to objects, appearances, behaviors, or even situations.

  This expression is less about a strong, active aversion (like 嫌う) and more about a passive sense of something simply not being appealing or acceptable to one's personal sensibilities. It implies a mismatch between the subject's internal 「気 (ki)」(feelings or spirit) and the object. For instance, you might use 「気に入らない」 for a piece of clothing that doesn't quite suit your style, a design that looks off, or a proposal that just doesn't feel right. It can also refer to a person's attitude or behavior that you find displeasing, though it is softer than saying you "hate" the person.

  The base verb is 「気に入る」, meaning "to like" or "to be pleased with." 「気に入らない」is its negative form.

      taste, without necessarily causing offense.

  - term: 納得いかない
    meaning: cannot understand or accept, doesn't make sense
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「納得いかない」is used when something is illogical, unreasonable, or unjust, and therefore cannot

      logical disagreement.

post_false_friends_writeup: While 「気に入らない」and the expressions above convey some form of negative sentiment,
  their underlying reasons and nuances differ significantly. 「気に入らない」is about a subjective personal preference
  or aesthetic mismatch, whereas 「嫌い」implies a stronger emotional dislike, 「不満」suggests unmet expectations
  or general discontent, and 「気に障る」indicates offense or hurt feelings. 「納得いかない」is reserved for situations
  that are logically or morally unacceptable. Understanding these distinctions is key to choosing the
  most appropriate expression.
