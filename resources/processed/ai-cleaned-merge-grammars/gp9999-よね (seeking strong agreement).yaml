etymology: The particle 「よね」 is a combination of the sentence-final particles 「よ」 (yo), which asserts
  information or emphasizes a point, and 「ね」 (ne), which seeks agreement or softens a statement. Historically,
  both 「よ」 and 「ね」 have long histories in Japanese as sentence-final particles. Their combination emerged
  as a natural way to express this specific nuance of presenting information with a sense of shared understanding
  and inviting confirmation, merging assertion with agreement-seeking.
writeup: |-
  The particle 「よね」 is a widely used sentence-final particle in Japanese that serves to seek agreement, confirm information, or share common understanding with the listener. It is a fusion of two distinct particles, 「よ」 (yo), which asserts information or emphasizes a point, and 「ね」 (ne), which seeks agreement or softens a statement. When combined as 「よね」, it carries a nuanced meaning that implies the speaker assumes the listener shares the same understanding or knowledge and is inviting them to confirm it.

  This particle is highly versatile and can attach to various parts of speech in their plain forms. For verbs and い-adjectives, it directly follows the plain form (e.g., 食べる よね, おいしい よね). For な-adjectives and nouns, it typically attaches after 「だ」 (e.g., きれい だ よね, 学生 だ よね), though in more polite contexts, 「です」 or 「ます」 forms can precede it (e.g., きれい です よね, 食べます よね).

  「よね」 is often used when the speaker is fairly certain of something and is inviting the listener to affirm it. For instance, if you and a friend are looking at a beautiful sunset, saying 「きれい だ よね！」 (It's beautiful, isn't it!) doesn't just state that it's beautiful; it implicitly asks for your friend's concurrence. It can also be used to confirm something the speaker believes they already know, like 「明日、テストがある よね？」 (There's a test tomorrow, right?).

  While 「よね」 is commonly used in casual and semi-formal conversations, its politeness level largely depends on the preceding verb or adjective form. When used with plain forms, it's casual. When used with ます/です forms, it maintains a degree of politeness appropriate for many everyday interactions.
false_friends:
  - term: よ (emphasis・information sharing)
    meaning: Particle asserting information, emphasizing a point, or providing new information to the
      listener.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「よ」 emphatically states something or provides new information, implying the speaker knows
      something the listener might not. It does not primarily seek agreement. 「よね」, in contrast, implies
      shared understanding and seeks confirmation.
    grammar_point: よ (emphasis・information sharing)
  - term: ね (seeking agreement)
    meaning: Particle seeking gentle agreement or confirmation, softening a statement, or indicating shared
      sentiment.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「ね」 is a softer particle that invites agreement or confirms shared sentiment without strong
      assertion. 「よね」 is more direct in seeking confirmation of a shared assumption.
    grammar_point: ね (seeking agreement)
  - term: だろう・でしょう (probably・right?)
    meaning: Expresses probability, conjecture, or seeks confirmation in a more formal/rhetorical manner.
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「でしょう」 (or casual 「だろ」) is used for conjecture or to seek confirmation, often when the speaker
      is quite sure but still allows for disagreement. 「よね」 is more about confirming *shared* understanding
      or common knowledge. 「でしょう」 can sometimes sound more assertive or rhetorical than 「よね」.
    grammar_point: だろう・でしょう (probably・right?)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「よ」, 「ね」, and 「でしょう」 might appear similar to 「よね」, their nuances differ.
  「よ」 emphasizes the speaker's statement, indicating new information or assertion. 「ね」 gently seeks agreement
  or acknowledges shared sentiment. 「でしょう」 expresses conjecture or asks for confirmation, sometimes with
  a rhetorical tone. 「よね」 uniquely combines the assertion of 「よ」 with the agreement-seeking of 「ね」, creating
  a specific nuance of confirming a shared understanding or assumption. Remember, 「よね」 implies, "You know
  this, right? We're on the same page."

  - english: This movie is really interesting, isn't it?
    japanese:
      - この 映画、すごく 面白い {よ ね}。
      - この 映画、すごく 面白い です {よ ね}。
    english_literally: This movie, very interesting, isn't it?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 映画、すごく 面白い {ね}。
        english: This movie is really interesting, huh?
        hint: 「ね」 is a softer particle that gently seeks agreement. 「よね」 implies a stronger assumption
          of shared understanding and seeks clearer confirmation. We're looking for a particle that implies
          you're fairly sure the listener agrees.
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 映画、すごく 面白い {よ}。
        english: This movie is really interesting!
        hint: 「よ」 asserts information strongly, often conveying new information or emphasizing a point
          to the listener. We're looking for a particle that seeks agreement, not just asserts.

        hint: 「でしょう」 is used for conjecture or polite confirmation, but doesn't carry the same nuance
          of shared knowledge. We're looking for a phrase to confirm something you think you already know.

          of mutual thought.

      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日、すごく 寒い {ね}。
        english: It's really cold today, huh?
        hint: While 「ね」 can seek agreement, 「よね」 expresses a stronger shared feeling, assuming the listener
          also feels the cold. We're looking for a particle that implies a shared experience.
    scene: Two women meet outdoors on a chilly day, remarking on the weather.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: Although 「よね」 is largely gender-neutral, in a casual setting between female friends, it helps
      establish rapport and communal feeling, such as in 「寒い よね」. The speaker implicitly invites the listener
      to confirm their shared experience of the cold.
  - english: That was a tough game, wasn't it?

          - きつい 試合 だっ た {だろ}。
        english: That was probably a tough game, wasn't it?
        hint: 「だろ」 expresses conjecture but doesn't necessarily seek the same level of empathetic agreement
          on a shared experience as 「よね」 or 「よな」. We're looking for a particle that implies shared understanding
          of a recent event.
    scene: Two male friends are discussing a sports game they just finished or watched, acknowledging
      its difficulty.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: While 「よね」 is used by both genders, in very casual male speech, it can sometimes be pronounced
      or replaced with 「よな」 (as in 「きつい 試合 だった よな」). This variant conveys a similar sense of shared understanding
      and confirmation, often used among close male friends.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 「よね」 can be adapted to various politeness levels and contexts.
  It's a fundamental particle for engaging in conversations where you expect or seek a common ground with
  your listener. Pay attention to the form preceding 「よね」 (plain vs. polite) to match the appropriate
  level of formality for your interaction.
