    "etymology": "「下 (shita)」 literally means \"under\" or \"below\". When combined with 「で (de)」, it indicates a state or condition under which something occurs. The addition of 「の (no)」 allows it to modify a noun, specifying the context of being under that noun's influence or authority.",
    "writeup": "「の下で (no shita de)」 indicates that something is happening under the influence, guidance, supervision, or on the basis of something else. 「下 (shita)」 literally means \"under\" or \"below\", and in this context, it is used to express a metaphorical sense of being \"under\" someone or something's influence or control. This expression is generally considered formal.\n\nThis grammatical structure typically consists of a noun (A) followed by 「の」, then 「下 (shita)」, and finally either the particle 「で (de)」 or 「に (ni)」. The noun (A) can refer to a specific person or a general situation.\n\nOccasionally, 「で」 or 「に」 can be omitted, and a comma may be used directly after 「下」. This omission often enhances the formality of the expression.\n\nIt is important to note that 「下」 can also be directly attached to many nouns, forming compound words that convey a similar meaning. Examples include 「統治下 (tōchika, under the reign)」, 「指揮下 (shikika, under the direction)」, 「影響下 (eikyōka, under the influence)」, 「占領下 (senryōka, under the occupation)」, and 「支配下 (shihaika, under the control)」.",
