    "writeup": "「ことがある」 is a versatile grammatical phrase used to express that an action or state occurs occasionally, from time to time, or under certain circumstances. It conveys a sense of irregularity or sporadic occurrence, contrasting with habitual or continuous actions. It can be translated as \"there are times when...\" or \"sometimes...\" in English.\n\n### Formation:\n-   **Verbs and い-Adjectives:** Attach to their plain non-past form (e.g., 食べる + ことがある, 寒い + ことがある).\n-   **な-Adjectives:** The stem is followed by 「なことがある」 (e.g., 静か + なことがある).\n-   **Nouns:** Typically followed by 「のことがある」 (e.g., 友達 + のことがある). A more formal and definitive nuance can be conveyed with 「であることがある」 (e.g., 先生 + であることがある).\n\n### Nuance and Usage:\nThis grammar point highlights that the event or condition is not a regular routine or a constant state. Instead, it happens intermittently, possibly depending on specific situations or conditions. It implies a degree of unpredictability or an exception to a general rule. For example, if someone usually takes the train, but occasionally walks, they would use 「歩くことがある」. The polite form is 「ことがあります」.",

            "nuance": "While 「ことがある」 in this grammar point describes an event that happens occasionally or intermittently, 「〜したことがある」 specifically refers to having done something at least once in the past, marking it as a past experience.

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「ことがある」 can be broadly translated as 'sometimes' or 'occasionally,' it carries a deeper nuance than simple adverbs like 「時々」. 「時々」 merely denotes frequency, whereas 「ことがある」 often implies that the occurrence is conditional, irregular, or a deviation from the norm, indicating that 'there are times when' something happens rather than just a casual 'sometimes.' Furthermore, it is crucial not to confuse this usage of 「ことがある」 with the similar-sounding 「〜したことがある」. The latter specifically refers to having a past experience (e.g., 寿司 を 食べた ことが ある - 'I have had the experience of eating sushi'). The present grammar point, however, focuses on events that occur intermittently or under specific circumstances. Finally, 「ところがある」 describes inherent qualities or aspects of a person or thing, rather than actions or events.",
