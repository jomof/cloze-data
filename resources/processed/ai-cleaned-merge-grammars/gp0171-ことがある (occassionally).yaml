        "part-of-speech": "phrase",

        "usage-context": "Used to describe occasional events or actions, providing a sense of frequency or irregularity.",
        "function": "Indicates that something happens from time to time, but not regularly.",
        "nuance": "The nuance is that the event or action is not a routine or habit, but something that occurs sporadically."
    },
    "etymology": "「こと」 (koto) means 'thing' or 'event,' and 「ある」 (aru) means 'to exist' or 'to happen.' Together, 「ことがある」 literally translates to 'there is a thing that happens,' indicating an occasional occurrence.",
    "writeup": "「ことがある」 is a versatile grammatical phrase used to express that an action or state occurs occasionally, from time to time, or under certain circumstances. It conveys a sense of irregularity or sporadic occurrence, contrasting with habitual or continuous actions. It can be translated as \"there are times when...\" or \"sometimes...\" in English.\n\n### Formation:\n-   **Verbs and い-Adjectives:** Attach to their plain non-past form (e.g., 食べる + ことがある, 寒い + ことがある).\n-   **な-Adjectives:** The stem is followed by 「なことがある」 (e.g., 静か + なことがある).\n-   **Nouns:** Typically followed by 「のことがある」 (e.g., 友達 + のことがある). A more formal and definitive nuance can be conveyed with 「であることがある」 (e.g., 先生 + であることがある).\n\n### Nuance and Usage:\nThis grammar point highlights that the event or condition is not a regular routine or a constant state. Instead, it happens intermittently, possibly depending on specific situations or conditions. It implies a degree of unpredictability or an exception to a general rule. For example, if someone usually takes the train, but occasionally walks, they would use 「歩くことがある」. The polite form is 「ことがあります」.",
