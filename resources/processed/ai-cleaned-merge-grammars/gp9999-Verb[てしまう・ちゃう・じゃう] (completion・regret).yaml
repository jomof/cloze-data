jlpt: N4
details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: casual
  function: expresses completion, accidental action, or regret
  nuance: adds a sense of finality, often implying an action was done completely or irrevocably. Can also
    convey regret over an action, or that an action was done unintentionally/accedintally. The contracted
    forms (ちゃう・じゃう) are more casual and frequently used in everyday speech.
etymology: The verb 「しまう」 originally meant 'to put away' or 'to finish.' When affixed to the te-form of
  another verb, it carries this nuance of 'putting something away' or 'finishing something completely.'
  This evolved into expressing the completion of an action, and from there, the nuances of regret (as
  in, 'I've finished it, and now I can't undo it') or accidental completion (as in, 'it just happened
  and finished on its own') naturally developed. The contractions 「ちゃう」 and 「じゃう」 are phonetic shortenings
  that emerged from rapid speech.
writeup: "The auxiliary verb 「しまう」 attaches to the te-form of a verb and conveys a sense of completion,\
  \ often with additional nuances of regret, unexpectedness, or doing something thoroughly. It signifies\
  \ that an action has been carried out to its end, leaving no room for further action or undoing. This\
  \ completion can be a straightforward statement of fact, but it frequently carries an emotional overtone\
  \ depending on the context.\n\nWhen used to express regret, 「〜てしまう」 implies that the action was something\
  \ one wishes had not happened, or that it led to an undesirable outcome. It's often translated as 'ended\
  \ up doing' or 'did completely (to my regret)'. For example, if you say 「ケーキを全部食べてしまった」 (I ate all the\
  \ cake), it might mean you finished it all, and now regret it because you feel sick, or it was for someone\
  \ else. \n\nIt can also convey that an action happened accidentally or unintentionally, where the speaker\
  \ might not have had full control. For instance, 「財布を忘れてしまった」 (I forgot my wallet) implies it was an\
  \ accidental, completed action. \n\nThe contracted forms 「ちゃう」 (from verbs ending in consonant + て or\
  \ い-ending verbs) and 「じゃう」 (from verbs ending in んで) are highly common in casual spoken Japanese. These\
  \ contractions maintain the same core meanings of completion, regret, or unexpectedness but are less\
  \ formal than 「〜てしまう」. They are ubiquitous in daily conversation, making them essential for natural\
  \ Japanese communication.\n\nUnderstanding 「しまう」 is key to grasping the full emotional and circumstantial\
  \ context of a completed action in Japanese. It's not just about what was done, but how the speaker\
  \ feels about it, or how it came to pass."

  - term: Verb[て] + おく (preparation・advance action)
    meaning: to do something in advance for a future purpose
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「〜てしまう」 emphasizes completion or consequence, 「〜ておく」 emphasizes performing an action
      in preparation for something else, or leaving something in a certain state. It implies foresight
      and purpose. For instance, 「本を読んでおいた」 (I read the book in advance) vs. 「本を読んでしまった」 (I finished reading
      the book / I accidentally read the book).
    grammar_point: Verb[ておく・とく] (preparation・advance action)
  - term: Verb[て] + いく (change toward future・movement away from speaker)
    meaning: to go on doing; to continue; to become (change moving away)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜ていく」 indicates an action that progresses into the future or moves away from the speaker,
      focusing on continuity or change over time. It doesn't carry the sense of finality or regret found
      in 「〜てしまう」. For example, 「日本語を勉強していく」 (I will continue studying Japanese) vs. 「日本語を勉強してしまった」 (I
      finished studying Japanese / I regretted studying Japanese).
    grammar_point: 〜ていく (change toward future・movement away from speaker)
  - term: Verb[て] + くる (change toward present・movement toward speaker)
    meaning: to come doing; to have done (change moving toward)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜てくる」 indicates an action that has continued up to the present, or a change that has progressed
      up to the present. It implies a sense of action or change moving towards the speaker or the present
      moment, lacking the definitive completion or regret of 「〜てしまう」. For example, 「日本語を勉強してきた」 (I have
      been studying Japanese up till now) vs. 「日本語を勉強してしまった」 (I finished studying Japanese / I regretted
      studying Japanese).
    grammar_point: 〜てくる (change toward present・movement toward speaker)
post_false_friends_writeup: 「〜てしまう」 is distinct from 「〜ておく」, 「〜ていく」, and 「〜てくる」 primarily in its nuance
  of completion, often with a sense of finality, regret, or accidental occurrence. Whereas 「〜ておく」 implies
  preparatory action, and 「〜ていく」/「〜てくる」 describe actions or changes over time and space, 「〜てしまう」 marks
  an action as done and dusted, sometimes to the speaker's chagrin or surprise.

      - competing_japanese:
          - レポート を 書き まし た。
        english: I wrote the report.
        hint: Using just the plain past tense 「書きました」 states the action simply occurred, without the nuance
          of full completion or any associated feeling like satisfaction or relief. We're looking for
          an expression that emphasizes the finality of the action.
      - competing_japanese:
          - レポート を 書い て おき まし た。
        english: I wrote the report in advance (for a future purpose).
        hint: 「〜ておく」 implies doing something as a preparation for later. Here, the emphasis is on the
          action being fully done, perhaps with a sense of relief, not as a preparation. We're looking
          for an expression of completion.

          - あー、ジュース を 全部 飲ん だ！

          at having consumed all the juice, which 「〜ちゃった」 conveys. We're looking for a nuance of accidental
          or regrettable completion.
    scene: You were thirsty and drank a whole carton of juice without realizing how much was left.

        hint: 「買った」 simply states that the purchase occurred. The speaker expresses regret or the sense
          that it was an unintended consequence, which 「〜てしまった」 emphasizes. We're looking for a completed
          action with a sense of negative consequence.
    scene: You went shopping and made an impulse purchase you now regret.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one

      item. It implies that the action is completed and cannot be undone, leading to a negative feeling.

        english: The cake was so delicious, so I ate it all!
        hint: The plain past 「食べた」 lacks the enthusiastic nuance of complete consumption often associated
          with 「〜ちゃった」 in positive contexts. We're looking for an expression that conveys a thorough,
          possibly enthusiastic, completion of the action.
    scene: You finished a delicious cake.
    register: casual
    setting: excited
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: In this context, 「〜食べちゃった」 doesn't imply regret but rather a thorough, complete, and perhaps
      even enthusiastic consumption of the cake due to its deliciousness. The casual contraction and the
      exclamation mark contribute to the excited tone. This is common when expressing something good that
      happened completely.

post_example_writeup: The examples illustrate how 「〜てしまう」 and its contracted forms 「〜ちゃう」/「〜じゃう」 can convey
  various nuances, from simple completion to accidental occurrence or regret. Pay close attention to the
  context and the speaker's emotion to discern the precise meaning. While sometimes expressing sheer completion,
  it is often imbued with a sense of finality that might be positive (like finishing a task) or negative
  (like breaking something or missing a deadline).
