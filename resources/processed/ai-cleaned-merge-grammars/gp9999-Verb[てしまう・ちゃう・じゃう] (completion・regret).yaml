formation:
  Verb[て形] + しまう: Attaches to the te-form of a verb. The 'te' can contract with 'しまう' to 'ちゃう' if the
    preceding sound is voiceless (e.g., -て + しまう → -っちゃう) or to 'じゃう' if voiced (e.g., -で + しまう → -じゃう).
  Verb[て形] + しまう (completed action): The action is fully finished, and nothing more can be done about
    it. This can be neutral, positive, or negative.
  Verb[て形] + しまう (accidental action or regrettable result): The action occurred unintentionally or led
    to an unfortunate situation. Often expresses a feeling of 'oh no' or 'it happened.'
  Verb[て形] + しまう (getting something over with): Implies doing something quickly to get it out of the way
    or finishing it completely to move on.

details:
  part-of-speech: auxiliary verb
  register: teineigo (polite)
  temporal-flow: completion
  spatial-flow: completion by moving into a finished state
etymology: The auxiliary verb しまう originates from the verb 仕舞う (しまう), meaning 'to put away' or 'to finish.'
  When attached to the te-form of another verb, it originally conveyed the sense of 'putting away' or
  'completing' that action. Over time, this evolved to include the nuances of finality, accidental completion,
  and regret. The idea is that an action is 'put away' or 'done and gone,' often implying it's irreversible
  or happened despite one's intentions. The contractions ちゃう and じゃう are phonetic shifts common in casual
  Japanese speech, reflecting a natural tendency to shorten frequently used constructions.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point Verb[てしまう・ちゃう・じゃう] is a crucial auxiliary verb construction used to express various nuances related to the completion of an action. Its core meanings revolve around **completion**, **accidental action**, and **regret**. While the core meaning is 'to complete,' the surrounding context and speaker's intonation determine whether it carries a neutral, accidental, or regrettable tone.

  **1. Completion (Neutral or Emphatic):**
  When used to simply indicate completion, it implies that an action has been carried out thoroughly or completely. It can convey a sense of finality or that something is 'done and over with.'

  **2. Accidental Action:**
  This is a very common usage. It indicates that an action occurred unintentionally or by mistake. The speaker often feels a sense of surprise or mild dismay that the action happened, regardless of its outcome.

  **3. Regret or Trouble:**
  Perhaps the most emotionally charged nuance, this expresses the speaker's regret, disappointment, or sense of trouble caused by the completed action. It implies that something undesirable has happened, and there's often nothing that can be done to undo it.

  **Contracted Forms: ちゃう and じゃう**
  The forms 〜ちゃう and 〜じゃう are casual contractions of 〜てしまう. They are widely used in spoken Japanese and informal writing. The contraction depends on the preceding sound:
  * If the te-form ends in 「て」 (e.g., 食べる → 食べて), it contracts to 「ちゃう」 (e.g., 食べちゃう).
  * If the te-form ends in 「で」 (e.g., 読む → 読んで), it contracts to 「じゃう」 (e.g., 読んじゃう).

  These contractions carry the same range of meanings as 〜てしまう but are reserved for casual conversations. Using 〜ちゃう or 〜じゃう in formal settings would sound inappropriate.

  Understanding the context and the speaker's feelings is key to correctly interpreting 〜てしまう. It is a versatile expression that adds significant emotional and aspectual depth to verbs.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[ておく]
    meaning: to do something in advance; to leave something as is
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Unlike Verb[てしまう] which implies completion, accident, or regret, Verb[ておく] expresses an action
      done in preparation for a future event, or leaving something in a certain state intentionally. It's
      about planning or leaving, not finality or an undesired outcome.
    grammar_point: ておく (to do in advance)
  - term: Verb[てある]
    meaning: something has been done (and the result remains)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While Verb[てしまう] emphasizes the completion of an action itself (often by the subject), Verb[てある]
      focuses on the resulting state of an object as a result of a prior, intentional action (often by
      someone else). It describes a completed action whose *result* is still present.
    grammar_point: てある (resultant state)
  - term: Verb[てみる]
    meaning: to try doing something
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Verb[てしまう] is about an action being completed, accidentally done, or regretted. Verb[てみる]
      implies trying out an action to see what happens or to gain experience. It's experimental, not about
      the finality or consequence of an action.
    grammar_point: てみる (try and see)
  - term: Verb[おわる]
    meaning: to finish
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Verb[おわる] simply means 'to finish' an action or task, often objectively. Verb[てしまう] also means
      'to finish,' but it adds nuances of completion (e.g., getting it over with), accidental occurrence,
      or regret. While similar in indicating completion, てしまう carries more emotional or circumstantial
      weight.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[stem]おわる (to finish doing)
post_false_friends_writeup: When differentiating between 〜てしまう and similar expressions, remember that
  〜てしまう often carries a sense of finality, something being 'done and gone,' or an emotional overlay of
  regret or unintentionality. For instance, while 〜ておく is about preparing for the future or leaving things
  as they are, and 〜てある focuses on the existing result of a prior action, 〜てしまう emphasizes the completion
  or the unintended outcome of the action itself. Similarly, 〜てみる is about experimentation, and 〜おわる is
  a neutral 'finish,' whereas 〜てしまう can infuse that 'finish' with additional meaning like 'got it over
  with' or 'oops, it's done.'
