        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "semi-formal",
        "usage-context": "Applicable in various situations, from casual to polite, when offering something conditionally.",
        "function": "Offers a conditional suggestion or permission, often with humility.",
        "nuance": "Implies the speaker is checking acceptability or suitability, often with a subtle hint that the offering might not be perfect or ideal, but is available.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a conditional clause modifying the main clause."
    },
    "etymology": "The expression 「でよければ」 combines the particle 「で」 (indicating means or condition) with 「よければ」, the conditional form of the adjective 「いい」 (good). The literal sense is \"if it is good with/by (this condition)\", suggesting acceptance or suitability under a particular circumstance.",
    "writeup": "「でよければ」 is used to politely offer something, implying that it might not be the best option, but it's acceptable. It's constructed from the particle 「で」 and the conditional form 「よければ」 of the い-adjective 「いい」 (good). It literally means \"if it's okay with/by (this),\" and is similar to \"if (A) is ok\". It always follows nouns or noun phrases. It often relates to oneself, in order to politely offer some sort of help, advice, or service. It implies the speaker is checking if the quality or ability of (A) is good enough to achieve some specific result.",
