    "etymology": "The expression 「でよければ」 combines the particle 「で」 (indicating means or condition) with 「よければ」, the conditional form of the adjective 「いい」 (good). The literal sense is \"if it is good with/by (this condition)\", suggesting acceptance or suitability under a particular circumstance.",
    "writeup": "「でよければ」 is used to politely offer something, implying that it might not be the best option, but it's acceptable. It's constructed from the particle 「で」 and the conditional form 「よければ」 of the い-adjective 「いい」 (good). It literally means \"if it's okay with/by (this),\" and is similar to \"if (A) is ok\". It always follows nouns or noun phrases. It often relates to oneself, offering help, advice, or service. It implies the speaker is checking if the quality/ability is good enough to achieve a specific result.",
