        "part-of-speech": "phrase",
        "register": "semi-formal",
        "usage-context": "Applicable in various situations, from casual to polite, when offering something conditionally.",
        "function": "Offers a conditional suggestion or permission, often with humility.",
        "nuance": "Implies the speaker is checking acceptability or suitability, often with a subtle hint that the offering might not be perfect or ideal, but is available.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions as a conditional clause modifying the main clause."
    },
    "etymology": "The expression 「でよければ」 combines the particle 「で」 (indicating means or condition) with 「よければ」, the conditional form of the adjective 「いい」 (good). The literal sense is \"if it is good with/by (this condition)\", suggesting acceptance or suitability under a particular circumstance.",
    "writeup": "「でよければ」 is used to politely offer something, implying that it might not be the best option, but it's acceptable. It's constructed from the particle 「で」 and the conditional form 「よければ」 of the い-adjective 「いい」 (good). It literally means \"if it's okay with/by (this),\" and is similar to \"if (A) is ok\". It always follows nouns or noun phrases. It often relates to oneself, in order to politely offer some sort of help, advice, or service. It implies the speaker is checking if the quality or ability of (A) is good enough to achieve some specific result.",

                    "competing_grammar": "私 が いいなら お手伝いしますよ",
                    "mitigation": "Using 「でよければ」 rather than 「がいいなら」 conveys a humble willingness to help, subtly acknowledging that the speaker might not be the most experienced or the primary choice, but is available and willing to assist. The scene is set for a deferential offer."

                    "mitigation": "While a direct offer, 「手伝いましょうか」 lacks the conditional humility of 「でよければ」. The scene emphasizes offering help in a non-imposing manner to someone struggling, where a gentle, conditional offer is more appropriate."

            "nuance": "The use of 「お手伝いしますよ」 is a polite and helpful expression. When combined with 「私でよければ」, from a younger female speaker to an older male colleague, it conveys a strong sense of deference and humble readiness to assist, without overstepping boundaries."
