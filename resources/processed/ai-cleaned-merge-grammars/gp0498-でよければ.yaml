        "[Noun] + でよければ": "Indicates that something is 'good enough' or 'acceptable' if the listener doesn't mind."

    "etymology": "The expression 「でよければ」 combines the particle 「で」 (indicating means or condition) with 「よければ」, the conditional form of the adjective 「いい」 (good). The literal sense is \"if it is good with/by (this condition)\", suggesting acceptance or suitability under a particular circumstance.",
    "writeup": "「でよければ」 is used to politely offer something, implying that it might not be the best option, but it's acceptable. It's constructed from the particle `「で」` and the conditional form `「よければ」` of the い-adjective `「いい」` (good). It literally means \"if it's okay with/by (this),\" and is similar to \"if (A) is ok\". It always follows nouns or noun phrases. It often relates to oneself, in order to politely offer some sort of help, advice, or service. It implies the speaker is checking if the quality/ability of (A) is good enough to achieve some specific result.",

                    "competing_grammar": "焼き肉がいいなら",
                    "mitigation": "Using 「でよければ」 rather than a direct 「いいなら」 softens the suggestion, implying that yakiniku might not be the listener's absolute preference, but it's a convenient and agreeable option for the speaker to offer. The scene encourages this nuanced offering."
