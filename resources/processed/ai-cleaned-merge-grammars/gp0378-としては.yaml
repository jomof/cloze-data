    "etymology": "The grammar point 「としては」 is derived from 「として」 (as), which itself comes from the te-form of the verb 「する」 (to do). The particle 「は」 is added to emphasize the subject and set it as a point of comparison. Literally, it could be interpreted as \"doing as, regarding...\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「としては」 is used to set a standard for comparison or evaluation. It combines 「として」, meaning \"as,\" with the particle 「は」, emphasizing the noun that precedes it. 「としては」 can be translated as \"as a,\" \"for a,\" or \"as for,\" depending on the context.\n\nIt's used to make general judgments based on what is usually expected of something. It often highlights a person or organization's standpoint when making an assumption. When not referring to people or organizations, it indicates the broad topic before offering thoughts about it.\n\n*   **Emphasis:** Highlights the subject for comparison.\n*   **Context:** Used for broad judgments, considering all aspects of the subject.",
