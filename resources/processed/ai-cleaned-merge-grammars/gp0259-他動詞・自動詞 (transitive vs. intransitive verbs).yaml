etymology: 他動詞 (tadoushi) consists of 他 (ta, "other"), 動 (dou, "move"), and 詞 (shi, "word"), indicating
  a verb that affects something else. 自動詞 (jidoushi) consists of 自 (ji, "self"), 動 (dou, "move"), and
  詞 (shi, "word"), signifying a verb describing self-initiated action.
writeup: |-
  Japanese verbs are fundamentally categorized into two types: **他動詞** (tadoushi), or transitive verbs, and **自動詞** (jidoushi), or intransitive verbs.

  **他動詞** describe actions performed by a subject *upon* an object. The subject actively causes something to happen to another entity. These verbs typically take a direct object marked with the particle **を**.

  **自動詞** describe actions or states where the subject itself is undergoing a change or performing an action without directly affecting an external object. The action or change occurs *within* or *of* the subject. These verbs typically feature the subject marked with the particle **が**.

  A simplified way to consider this distinction is to think of transitive verbs as "other-moving" verbs (acting upon something else) and intransitive verbs as "self-moving" verbs (the subject moves or acts on its own). Many Japanese verbs exist in transitive/intransitive pairs, and recognizing these pairs is crucial for accurate expression.

  Consider the concepts of **動作** (dousa, action/motion initiated by the an agent) and **作用** (sayou, an effect or occurrence). While not traditional grammar terms for this distinction, **他動詞** often represent **動作** directed outward, and **自動詞** represent **作用** that manifests inherently.

  Though not conventionally grouped this way, **する** (suru, to do) and **なる** (naru, to become) can also be seen as a conceptual transitive/intransitive pair. **する** implies conscious control and agency, where the subject *does* something. Conversely, **なる** implies that something *becomes* or *occurs* on its own, often due to external factors or natural progression, lacking the subject's direct, controlling intent.

  - term: 開ける (akeru)・開く (aku)
    meaning: To open (transitive)・To open (intransitive)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While both relate to 「opening」, 「開ける」 requires an agent to perform the action, emphasizing
      who is doing the opening (e.g., "I open the door"). 「開く」 describes the state of something opening
      on its own or having opened, without specifying an agent (e.g., "The door opens").

  - term: 閉める (shimeru)・閉まる (shimaru)
    meaning: To close (transitive)・To close (intransitive)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Similar to 「開ける」・「開く」, 「閉める」 indicates an agent closing something (e.g., "Please close the
      window"), while 「閉まる」 describes something closing by itself or being in a closed state, without

      movie begins").

  - term: する (suru)・なる (naru)
    meaning: To do (transitive)・To become (intransitive)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: Though not a morphological pair, 「する」 implies an agent's direct action or intention (e.g.,
      「宿題をする」, 'to do homework'), while 「なる」 describes a state change or an event occurring without direct
      external agency (e.g., 「大人になる」, 'to become an adult').

  - term: 壊す (kowasu)・壊れる (kowareru)
    meaning: To break (transitive)・To break (intransitive)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「壊す」 means an agent intentionally or accidentally breaks something (e.g., 「おもちゃを壊す」, 'to break
      a toy'). 「壊れる」 describes something breaking on its own or being in a broken state, without emphasizing
      the agent (e.g., 「おもちゃが壊れる」, 'the toy breaks').

post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the agentive nature of transitive verbs versus the non-agentive
  nature of intransitive verbs is key to distinguishing these pairs. Transitive verbs use particles like
  を to mark the object of an action, while intransitive verbs typically use がを mark the subject that undergoes
  a change or action inherently.
