        "part-of-speech": "noun",
        "register": "semi-formal",
        "function": "Expresses a state or condition that continues without change. Often implies a lack of action to alter the situation.",

    },
    "etymology": "The word 「まま」 originally meant \"as it is\" or \"in its natural state.\" Over time, it evolved to describe situations where things remain unchanged or are left in a particular state. It carries a sense of continuity or inaction.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point **まま** indicates that a certain state or action continues without alteration. It is used to express that something remains \"as is\" or that an action is performed while maintaining a previous condition. This can convey a sense of **acceptance**, **neglect**, or simply the **continuation** of a state. For instance, in `ドアを開けたまま`, it implies the door remains open. This construction connects two actions or states, where the second occurs while the first is maintained. While **まま** can be used neutrally, it often carries a nuance, particularly when describing situations that *should* have been changed but were not, implying **carelessness** or **negligence**. It is widely used across various registers, from casual conversation to more formal writing, depending on the context and the preceding word.",
