    "writeup": "The grammar point 「まま」 indicates that a certain state or action is maintained without any change. It implies that something is left as it is, either intentionally or unintentionally.  It's often used to describe a situation where something remains in its original condition or where an action continues without interruption.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n*   **Verb (past informal) + まま**: This indicates that an action happened and its result is maintained.  For example, 「電気をつけた**まま**寝てしまった」 means \"I fell asleep with the light on.\"\n*   **い-adjective + まま**:  This indicates that something remains in its original adjectival state.  For example, 「大きい**まま**」 means \"as something is big\", leaving something as it is.\n*   **な-adjective stem/ Noun + の + まま**:  This indicates that something remains in its original state as defined by the noun or adjective. For example, 「不便な**まま**」 means \"Leaving something is inconvenient\". 「昔の**まま**」means \"Leaving something as it was\".",
    "etymology": "The word 「まま」 originally meant \"as it is\" or \"in its original state.\" Over time, it evolved to express the idea of maintaining a condition or state without change. The etymology reinforces the core meaning of something being left untouched or unaltered.",
