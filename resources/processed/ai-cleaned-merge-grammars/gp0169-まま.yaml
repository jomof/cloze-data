    "writeup": "The grammar point 「まま」 indicates that a certain state or action continues without alteration. It's used to express that something remains \"as is\" or that an action is performed while maintaining a previous condition. It can convey a sense of neglect, acceptance, or simply the continuation of a state. For example, leaving the door open 「ドアを開けたまま」 implies the door remains open. It connects two actions or states, where the second occurs while the first is maintained. You can use this grammar point to describe negligence.",
