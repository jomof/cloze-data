    "writeup": "「に比べて」is a set expression used to compare one thing to another. It's often translated as \"(A) compared to (B)\" or \"when comparing (A) to (B).\" 「比べる」 is a *ru*-verb that means \"to compare\" or \"to contrast.\"\n\n「に比べて」 is attached directly after a noun, and the rest of the sentence explains the comparison. The case-marking particle 「と」can sometimes be used instead of 「に」. They are largely interchangeable, but 「に」 focuses slightly more on the changes/differences between similar features of (A) and (B). 「と」 often mutually contrasts (A) and (B), discussing their unique characteristics.\n\nIt is also possible to say 「に比べたら」, 「に比べれば」, and 「に比べると」.",
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に比べて」 comes from the verb 「比べる (kuraberu)」, meaning \"to compare.\" The 「に」 particle indicates the object of comparison, and the 「て」-form connects it to the rest of the sentence.",
