    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に比べて」 comes from the verb 「比べる」(くらべる), which means \"to compare.\" The 「に」 indicates the target of the comparison, and 「比べて」 is the te-form of the verb, acting as an adverbial phrase.",
    "writeup": "「に比べて」 is used to compare two or more things, highlighting differences or similarities. It is equivalent to saying \"compared to\" or \"in comparison with\" in English. This expression directly follows a noun.\n\nWhile 「に比べて」 is the most common form, other conjugations of 「比べる」 such as 「に比べたら」, 「に比べれば」, and 「に比べると」 are also possible. These forms offer slight nuances, but they all convey the core meaning of making a comparison.\n\nOccasionally, the particle 「と」 will be used instead of 「に」 (e.g., 「と比べて」). While 「に」 and 「と」 are largely interchangeable in this expression, 「に」 tends to focus more on the changes or differences between similar features of the compared items. In contrast, 「と」 often emphasizes the mutual contrast of items, discussing their individual or unique characteristics.",
