        "source": "Bunpro, DOJG"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に比べて」 (ni kurabete) originates from the verb 「比べる」 (kuraberu), meaning \"to compare\" or \"to contrast.\" The particle 「に」 (ni) indicates the object or target of the comparison, while 「比べて」 (kurabete) is the te-form of the verb. This te-form functions adverbially, creating a phrase that means \"comparing to\" or \"in comparison with.\" This structure is a direct evolution of the verb's usage to express a comparative action.",
    "writeup": "「に比べて」 is a versatile expression used to compare two or more things, emphasizing either their differences or similarities. It translates most commonly as \"compared to\" or \"in comparison with.\" This grammatical structure typically follows a noun, directly linking the comparison to that noun.\n\nWhile 「に比べて」 is the most frequently encountered form, other conjugations of the verb 「比べる」 (kuraberu) can also be used, such as 「に比べたら」 (ni kurabetara), 「に比べれば」 (ni kurabereba), and 「に比べると」 (ni kuraberu to). These alternative forms introduce subtle nuances:\n*   **に比べると (ni kuraberu to)**: Often implies a general observation or statement of fact based on a comparison.\n*   **に比べたら (ni kurabetara)**: Suggests a hypothetical or conditional comparison, as in \"if one were to compare...\"\n*   **に比べれば (ni kurabereba)**: Similar to 「に比べたら」, often implies a conditional comparison leading to a logical conclusion.\n\nOccasionally, the particle 「と」 (to) may be used instead of 「に」 (ni) to form 「と比べて」 (to kurabete). While both are largely interchangeable in this context, 「に」 tends to focus more on the changes or distinctions within similar features of the compared items. In contrast, 「と」 often highlights a mutual contrast, discussing the individual and unique characteristics of each item.",
