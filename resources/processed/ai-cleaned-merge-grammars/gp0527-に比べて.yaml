    "etymology": "The grammar point 「に比べて」 comes from the verb 「比べる」(くらべる), which means \"to compare.\" The 「に」 indicates the target of the comparison, and 「比べて」 is the te-form of the verb, acting as an adverbial phrase.",
    "writeup": "「に比べて」 is used to compare two or more things, highlighting differences or similarities. It's equivalent to saying \"compared to\" or \"in comparison with\" in English. It directly follows a noun.\n\nOther forms of 「比べる」 such as 「に比べたら」, 「に比べれば」, and 「に比べると」 are also possible, offering slightly different nuances, but with essentially the same core meaning. They all convey the idea of making a comparison.",
