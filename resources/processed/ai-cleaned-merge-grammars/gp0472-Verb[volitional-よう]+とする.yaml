        "nuance": "This grammar point carries the nuance of intentional effort, but doesn't guarantee completion of the action. It can also describe an action that was on the immediate verge of happening but was then interrupted. The past form, 「ようとした」, suggests the attempt was unsuccessful or interrupted. It emphasizes the decision to act, highlighting that the action was 100% decided upon."
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「ようとする」 combines the volitional form of a verb (indicating intent) with 「とする」 (to try/attempt). Thus, it literally means \"to intend to try\" or \"to try intending to do something.\"",
    "writeup": "The 「ようとする」 grammar point is used to express the idea of **attempting** to do something or being **about to** do something. It is formed by combining the volitional form of a verb (う or よう) with 「とする」.\n\nThis construction conveys a strong sense of intention and effort regarding the action. While it signifies a clear decision to perform the action, it does not guarantee its completion. Often, the action may be unsuccessful or interrupted.\n\n*   **Expressing an Attempt:** When used to mean \"try to,\" 「ようとする」 highlights the subject's active effort to perform an action. If the attempt fails, it suggests that the subject made a conscious effort but was unable to complete it for some reason.\n*   **Expressing Imminence/Interruption:** It can also describe an action that was on the verge of happening when something else occurred to prevent or interrupt it. In such cases, the phrase emphasizes that the action was fully decided upon, but an unexpected change prevented its execution.\n\nFor example, if you say 「家を出ようとしたら、雨が降り始めた。」 (When I was about to leave the house, it started raining.), it means you had firmly decided to leave, but the rain intervened at the very last moment.",
