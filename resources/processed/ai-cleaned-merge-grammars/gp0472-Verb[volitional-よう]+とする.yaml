    "etymology": "The grammar point is constructed from the volitional form of a verb (意向形, *ikōkei*), the particle と (*to*), and the verb する (*suru*, to do). The volitional form expresses intent, while と marks a result or content, and する adds the nuance of action or trying.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「Verb[volitional-よう]+とする」 expresses the idea of trying to do something, attempting something, or being about to do something. The 「よう」 form indicates volition, and 「とする」 adds the nuance of initiating that volition into action. It often implies that the action either didn't fully happen or was interrupted. It's similar to saying \"to endeavor to do\" something. For example, 「食べようとする」 means \"to try to eat.\" Be careful, as 「ようとする」 can also indicate one action interrupting another.",
