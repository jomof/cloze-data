    "etymology": "This grammar point combines 「と言う (to iu)」, meaning 'to say', with 「風に (fuu ni)」, meaning 'in the manner of' or 'like'. The literal sense is 'in a way that says', indicating the speaker's perception or interpretation of a situation rather than a definitive statement.",
    "writeup": "「という風に」 functions similarly to 「ふうに」, indicating something is done 'in the way of' or 'as if'. It expresses a speaker's interpretation or uncertainty about a situation. It's like saying something is done 'as if to say (A)', 'as if to suggest (A)', or 'in such a way that (A)'. Because 「という」 often quotes the statement before it, pay attention to what 「という風に」 emphasizes. This grammar point can follow verbs or nouns. This expression highlights the speaker's **uncertainty** about the actual situation. It's used to comment on appearances or perceived intentions.",
