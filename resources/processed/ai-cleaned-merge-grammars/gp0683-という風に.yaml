    "etymology": "This grammar point combines 「と言う (to iu)」, meaning 'to say', with 「風に (fuu ni)」, meaning 'in the manner of' or 'like'. The literal sense is 'in a way that says', indicating the speaker's perception or interpretation of a situation rather than a definitive statement.",
    "writeup": "「という風に」 functions similarly to 「ふうに」, indicating something is done 'in the way of' or 'as if'. It expresses a speaker's interpretation or uncertainty about a situation. It's like saying something is done 'as if to say (A)', 'as if to suggest (A)', or 'in such a way that (A)'. Because 「という」 often quotes the statement before it, pay attention to what 「という風に」 emphasizes. This grammar point can follow verbs or nouns. This expression highlights the speaker's **uncertainty** about the actual situation. It's used to comment on appearances or perceived intentions.",

            "listener_age": "younger",
            "nuance": "The use of 「聞いています」 in this context, when spoken by an older female to a younger female, can imply a subtle imparting of workplace gossip or information, characteristic of an older mentor figure sharing insights, albeit informally.",
            "etymology": "「休憩 (kyuukei)」 means 'break', indicating a pause in activity. 「聞く (kiku)」 means 'to hear' or 'to listen'."
