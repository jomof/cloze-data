        "[Sentence] + という風に": "Expresses a manner or way of doing something, suggesting a specific meaning or intention.",
        "[Noun Phrase 1] + は + [Description 1], [Noun Phrase 2] + は + [Description 2], という風に": "Lists examples or elements in a series, indicating 'and so on' or 'in this manner'."

    "etymology": "This grammar point combines 「と言う (to iu)」, meaning 'to say', with 「風に (fuu ni)」, meaning 'in the manner of' or 'like'. The literal sense is 'in a way that says', indicating the speaker's perception or interpretation of a situation rather than a definitive statement.",
    "writeup": "「という風に」 functions similarly to 「ふうに」, indicating something is done 'in the way of' or 'as if'. It expresses a speaker's interpretation or uncertainty about a situation. It's like saying something is done 'as if to say (A)', 'as if to suggest (A)', or 'in such a way that (A)'. Because 「という」 often quotes the statement before it, pay attention to what 「という風に」 emphasizes. This grammar point can follow verbs or nouns. This expression highlights the speaker's **uncertainty** about the actual situation; it is used to comment on appearances or perceived intentions.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene implies that the manager's message was not explicitly stated but rather interpreted from their actions or indirect words, which fits the nuanced interpretation of 「という風に」 better than a direct quote marker 「と」."
