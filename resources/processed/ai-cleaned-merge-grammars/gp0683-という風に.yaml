    "etymology": "This grammar point is formed from 「と言う (to iu)」, meaning 'to say,' and 「風に (fuu ni)」, meaning 'in the manner of' or 'like.' The combination literally translates to 'in a way that would say that...'",
    "writeup": "Similar to 「ふうに」, which expresses something being done 'in the way of (A),' 「という風に」 uses the same suffix 「風」 (wind, air) to express something being done 'as if to say (A),' 'as if to suggest (A),' or 'in such a way that (A).' Because this construction combines 「と言う」 (to say) and 「風に」 (in a manner), its literal meaning is close to 'in a way that would say that (A).' This emphasizes the speaker's uncertainty about the actual situation, commenting primarily on appearances.\n\n「という風に」 can follow verbs or nouns describing how something is done. The (B) portion of the phrase clarifies what's being done 'in a way as if to say (A).' It's **important** to remember that 「という」 often quotes the preceding statement, so consider this when interpreting what 「という風に」 emphasizes.",
