    "etymology": "The term 「第一」 is composed of 「第」, indicating order or position, and 「一」, meaning one. Together, they signify the foremost or the first in order, highlighting its primary or most important nature.",
    "writeup": "第一 (daiichi) serves as both an adverb and a noun. As an adverb, typically followed by **に**, it conveys \"first,\" \"to begin with,\" or \"above all else.\" As a noun, it means \"foremost\" or \"most important.\" In this capacity, it is commonly followed by **の** when modifying another noun, or by the auxiliary verb **だ** at the end of a sentence. The combination **まず第一に (mazu daiichi ni)** is used to emphasize \"the very first\" or \"first and foremost,\" adding a stronger sense of priority or initial action. The kanji **第 (dai)** denotes \"order\" or \"position,\" while **一 (ichi)** means \"one.\" Thus, **第一** literally signifies \"first position.\" This indicates its primary or leading role, whether in sequence, importance, or as a starting point.",
