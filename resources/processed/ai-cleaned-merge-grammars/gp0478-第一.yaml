    "etymology": "The term 「第一」 is composed of 「第」, indicating order or position, and 「一」, meaning one. Together, they signify the foremost or the first in order, highlighting its primary or most important nature.",
    "writeup": "第一 (daiichi) functions as both an adverb and a noun. As an adverb, typically followed by **に**, it conveys \"first,\" \"to begin with,\" or \"above all else.\" As a noun, it means \"foremost\" or \"most important.\" In this capacity, it is commonly followed by **の** when modifying another noun, or by the auxiliary verb **だ** at the end of a sentence. The combination **まず第一に (mazu daiichi ni)** is used to emphasize \"the very first\" or \"first and foremost,\" adding a stronger sense of priority or initial action. The kanji **第 (dai)** denotes \"order\" or \"position,\" while **一 (ichi)** means \"one.\" Thus, **第一** literally signifies \"first position.\" This indicates its primary or leading role, whether in sequence, importance, or as a starting point.",

            "nuance": "最初 refers to the temporal beginning of something, the first point in a sequence of events. 第一 can also indicate 'first' but often implies 'first in importance,' 'foremost,' or 'number one' in a structured list, not just the earliest in time."

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While expressions like 一番 (ichiban), 最初 (saisho), 優先 (yūsen), and まず (mazu) can sometimes be used similarly, 第一 (daiichi) carries a distinct nuance. 一番 broadly means 'most' or 'best,' while 最初 focuses on the temporal 'beginning.' 優先 specifically indicates 'prioritizing' something, and まず denotes a 'first step.' In contrast, 第一 emphasizes something being the foremost or absolute primary consideration, often serving as a fundamental principle or the leading item in a formal classification or ranking. It's less about a general 'best' or 'first in time' and more about 'first in significance' or 'primary importance.'",
