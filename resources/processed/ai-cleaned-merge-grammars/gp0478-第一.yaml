    "etymology": "第一 (dai-ichi) literally means \"number one\" or \"first\". It combines the kanji 第 (dai), which indicates a number in a sequence, and 一 (ichi), meaning \"one\". Thus, it directly translates to \"first position\" or \"number one\".",
    "writeup": "**第一 (daiichi)** can function as both a noun and an adverb. As a noun, it signifies \"foremost\" or \"most important.\" As an adverb, it means \"first\" or \"above all else.\" When used adverbially, it's often paired with **に (ni)**, becoming **第一に (daiichi ni)**. As a noun, it's followed by **の (no)** to connect nouns or by **だ (da)** at the end of a sentence. Pairing **まず (mazu) \"first of all\"** with **第一 (daiichi)** emphasizes the very first point. Remember that 第 literally means 'position' in a sequence.",
