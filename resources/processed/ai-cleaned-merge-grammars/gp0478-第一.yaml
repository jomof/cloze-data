    "etymology": "The term 「第一」 is composed of 「第」, indicating order or position, and 「一」, meaning one. Together, they signify the foremost or the first in order, highlighting its primary or most important nature.",
    "writeup": "**第一 (daiichi)** can function as both an adverb and a noun. As a noun, it means \"foremost\" or \"most important.\" As an adverb, it means \"first\" or \"above all else.\" To use 第一 adverbially, it's often paired with **に (ni)**. As a noun, it's usually followed by **の (no)** when connecting nouns, or by the auxiliary verb **だ (da)** at the end of a sentence.\n\nSometimes, **まず (mazu)**, meaning \"first of all,\" is used together with 第一. This might seem redundant, but it's similar to saying \"the very first\" in English.\n\nThe kanji **第 (dai)** is often translated as \"number,\" but its literal meaning is closer to \"position,\" referring to a place within a sequence. Therefore, 第一 simply means \"first position.\"",
