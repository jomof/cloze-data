    "etymology": "The etymological root of 「わざわざ」 lies in 「わざ」 (waza), meaning 'deed,' 'act,' or 'performance.' The reduplication 「わざわざ」 emphasizes the deliberate nature or special effort involved in an action. Historically, the kanji 「態態」 (waza-waza) was sometimes used, where 「態」 specifically denotes 'manner,' 'form,' or 'attitude,' and by extension, 'purpose' or 'intent.' This kanji usage underscores that the action described by 「わざわざ」 is undertaken with a clear will or intention, often requiring one to go out of their way.",
    "writeup": "「わざわざ」 (wazawaza) is an adverb that indicates someone has gone out of their way to do something. It can be translated as \"expressly,\" \"especially,\" or \"to go out of one's way.\" Typically, 「わざわざ」 appears at the beginning of a sentence, preceding a statement about an intentionally performed action.\n\n「わざわざ」 tends to be used positively, but it can also carry negative connotations, depending on the context. While almost never used, 「態態」 may be seen in kanji form. 「態」 expresses purpose or intent, suggesting a strong goal or willingness to do something. The translation of 「わざわざ」 depends on whether the actual result is positive, negative, or undecided:\n\n*   **Positive result:** To purposefully do (A), resulting in (A).\n*   **Negative result:** To have every intention of (A), but the actual result is (B).\n*   **Undecided result:** To be intent on (A), with (A) hopefully happening.",
