jlpt: N2
details:
  part-of-speech: conjunction
  register: formal
  usage-context: These expressions are used to add further information or an additional point to a preceding
    statement. While 'それに' is generally more casual and used for consistent tones, '加えて', 'その上', and 'しかも'
    tend to be more formal, often emphasizing that new information builds upon, intensifies, or is a significant
    addition to what has already been mentioned. They can highlight an unexpectedly good or bad consequence,
    an added advantage, or a compounding factor.
  function: To introduce additional information that supplements, intensifies, or amplifies what has already
    been stated, emphasizing a cumulative or reinforcing effect. They connect ideas by signifying an additional
    element or circumstance.
  nuance: While all convey addition, 'それに' requires tone consistency (all positive or all negative). '加えて'
    implies accumulation or augmentation, often formal. 'その上' often implies the added point is significant,
    creating a cumulative impact. 'しかも' emphasizes the added information as substantial, surprising, or
    strengthening the initial point, especially for objective facts or unexpected situations.
  grammatical-role: additive conjunction
  logical-flow: adds information or reinforces a previous statement
etymology: The etymology varies for each component. 「それに」 combines the pronoun 「それ」 (that) and the particle
  「に」 (to/in), literally meaning "to that" or "in addition to that," referring to the preceding clause.
  「加えて」 is the te-form of the verb 「加える」 (くわえる), meaning "to add" or "to include," functioning as an adverbial
  or conjunctive link. 「その上」 combines 「その」 (that) and 「上」 (ue, top), literally meaning "on top of that."
  「しかも」 originated from the archaic interjection 「然(しか)」 (as such) and the particle 「も」 (also), reflecting
  its function of adding more to what is already known. These etymologies highlight their common function
  of adding information to an existing context.
writeup: |-
  The grammar points 「それに」, 「加えて」, 「その上」, and 「しかも」 all function to add information to a preceding statement, yet each carries distinct nuances and typical usage contexts. Understanding these differences is key to using them accurately.

  **「それに」** is the most general and often casual of the group. It translates to "and," "besides," "moreover," or "in addition." A critical characteristic of 「それに」 is its **tone consistency**: the information introduced by 「それに」 must logically follow and share the same positive or negative emotional or factual valence as the preceding information. It cannot connect a positive statement to a negative one, or vice versa, as this would violate the sense of logical addition.

  **「加えて」** (te-form of 「加える」 'to add') is more formal and emphasizes literally "adding" something (an item, a fact, a reason) to a previous statement. It often appears in formal writing, reports, or academic discourse. It implies accumulation or augmentation, where the added information often magnifies or builds upon the preceding statement, highlighting a more complete picture or an increased degree of a situation. This augmentation can be positive or negative.

  **「その上」** (literally "on top of that") is also formal, but can be used in daily speech. It is used to add further information or an additional point, often emphasizing that the new information builds upon or adds to what has already been mentioned, implying a sense of cumulative impact or a "what's more" feeling. The added point is often significant.

  **「しかも」** translates to "moreover" or "furthermore." It is used to indicate that both the preceding statement (A) and the following statement (B) exist simultaneously or are in unison. It emphasizes that (B) is an important or significant addition to (A), often strengthening the initial point or providing an unexpected piece of information. 「しかも」 is typically used for objective statements or observable facts and can highlight an unexpectedly good or bad consequence, or a compounding factor.
false_friends:
  - term: おまけに
    meaning: In addition, On top of that, What is more, To make matters worse
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike these terms, 「おまけに」 often carries a sense of something extra, an 'added bonus' or 'added
      burden', and can sometimes imply an unexpected or even slightly negative turn, especially if the
      overall tone is already negative. It has a more casual feel.
    grammar_point: おまけに (in addition・on top of that)
  - term: なお
    meaning: In addition, Incidentally, Furthermore, Moreover
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「なお」 is primarily used in written communication or formal speech to introduce supplementary
      or additional information that is related but not necessarily a direct logical progression of the
      preceding statement. It often feels like an aside or a follow-up point. It lacks the strong emphasis
      on the cumulative or reinforcing nature.
    grammar_point: なお (supplementary information)
  - term: また
    meaning: Also, As well, Moreover, Again, Additionally
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「また」 can also mean "again" and is generally used for simple enumeration or listing additional
      items or facts without necessarily implying a strong logical connection or reinforcing tone consistency.
      It's a more neutral additive, lacking the emphatic nature of 'その上' or 'しかも'.
    grammar_point: また (again; also; or)
  - term: すると
    meaning: Having done..., If...is done..., (And/just) then, Thereupon, If so
    kind: synonym
    nuance: Unlike these terms, 「すると」 indicates a sequence of events or a result directly following from
      a previous action or condition, implying causality or a temporal relationship, rather than simply
      adding information.
    grammar_point: すると (and then・as a result)
  - term: 更に
    meaning: Even more, furthermore, in addition
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While these terms add information, 「更に」 implies a quantitative or qualitative increase, meaning
      "even more" or "further" in degree or extent. It can also introduce an additional point, but with
      a nuance of pushing the idea further, suggesting a progression or escalation.
    grammar_point: 更に (even more)
  - term: ははもちろん
    meaning: Not only...but also, let alone, not to mention, of course
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「はもちろん」 often implies that the first item is a given, obvious, or universally acknowledged
      fact, and then adds something surprising or extra. It means 'of course' or 'needless to say'.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:ははもちろん (not only... but also)
  - term: ばかりでなく
    meaning: Not only...but also, as well as
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「ばかりでなく」 is slightly less formal than 「加えて」 and frequently implies that the second item is
      unexpected or noteworthy, often highlighting a broader scope than initially perceived. It emphasizes
      that it's 'not just' the first thing, but also the second.
    grammar_point: 〜だけでなく・〜ばかりでなく・〜ばかりか (not only... but also)
  - term: をはじめ
    meaning: Not only...but also, starting with
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「をはじめ」 is used when the first item mentioned is a representative example from a larger group
      or category. It sets the primary example and then implies that other similar items also exist. It
      literally means 'starting with X' or 'X and others'.
    grammar_point: をはじめ (starting with)
  - term: 上に
    meaning: In addition to, As well, Besides
    kind: synonym
    nuance: While sharing a similar meaning of adding information, 「上に」 typically connects nouns or verb/adjective
      forms (e.g., Verb-plain form + 上に), indicating 'not only X but also Y', distinct from the fixed
      phrase 「その上」 acting as a conjunction between sentences. It highlights a combination of characteristics.
    grammar_point: 上に (in addition to)
  - term: 又〜も
    meaning: Moreover, additionally, and also, in addition, furthermore, or
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「又〜も」 is a more formal and literary expression primarily meaning 'and also' or 'again,' focusing
      on simple enumeration. It lacks the emphatic or reinforcing nuance of 「しかも」, which specifically
      highlights the importance or strong impact of the additional information on the preceding statement.
    grammar_point: 又〜も (additionally)
  - term: 且つ
    meaning: And; moreover; furthermore
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「且つ」 is a highly formal and literary conjunction that means 'and' or 'at the same time,' often
      used to list multiple attributes. While it shares 'moreover' in its meaning, 「しかも」 often implies
      a stronger logical connection or reinforcement of the preceding statement, whereas 「且つ」 is more
      about simultaneously existing qualities or actions.
    grammar_point: 且つ (and・moreover)
  - term: 並びに
    meaning: And; both ~ and ~; as well as
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「並びに」 is a highly formal connective used for simple enumeration, meaning 'and' or 'as well
      as.' Unlike 「しかも」, it does not carry a nuance of emphasizing the added information as significant,
      surprising, or reinforcing the preceding statement.
    grammar_point: 並びに (and・as well as・formal)
  - term: 及び
    meaning: And (formal)
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「及び」 is a formal conjunction meaning 'and,' used to connect items of equal importance, often
      in lists or formal documents. It lacks the strong emphasis or reinforcing nature of 「しかも」, which
      implies the added information significantly builds upon or impacts the preceding statement.
    grammar_point: 及び (and・formal)
post_false_friends_writeup: To discern the correct usage among these similar expressions, consider the
  specific nuance you wish to convey. 「それに」 is best used for simple, tone-consistent additions. 「加えて」
  is more formal and emphasizes accumulation or intensification. 「その上」 places more emphasis on the added
  information as significant or having a cumulative impact. 「しかも」 is used when the added information significantly
  strengthens or reinforces the preceding statement, often with an objective or surprising feel. Each
  of these can connect sentences or clauses, but their subtle differences in emphasis, formality, and
  implication of tone or impact are crucial.

    japanese:
      - 運動 は 楽しい です。それ に 体 に いい です。

      - competing_japanese:
          - 運動 は 楽しい です。また、体 に いい です。
        english: Exercise is enjoyable. Also, it is good for the body.
        hint: 「また」 simply lists an additional item or fact. We're looking for a grammar point that adds
          information with a reinforcing or compounding effect.
    scene: A person is encouraging a friend to start exercising.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    nuance: The use of 「～です」 throughout maintains a polite register. The sentence combines two positive
      attributes of exercise, fitting the tone consistency required by 「それに」. The casual version, 「運動
      は 楽しい。それに 体 に いい。」 would be used among close friends or family.
  - english: I work late into the night. On top of that, I have to get up early in the morning, so it's
      tough.

      - 夜 遅く まで 働い てる。それ に 朝 も 早い から、大変 だ。

        english: I am working late into the night. On top of that, I also have to get up early in the
          morning, so it's tough.
        hint: 「おまけに」 often implies an 'added burden' or an unexpected, often negative, additional fact.
          We're looking for a more neutral way to compound negative factors.
    scene: A tired employee is complaining about their grueling work schedule.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: melancholic
    speaker_gender: male
    nuance: The repeated use of 「～ます」 and 「～です」 indicates a polite tone. The combination of two negative
      aspects of the work schedule reinforces the difficult situation, making 「それに」 appropriate for connecting
      compounding negative factors. The casual version, 「夜 遅く まで 働い てる。それに 朝 も 早い から、大変 だ。」 uses 「～てる」
      (a contraction of 「～ている」) and 「～だ」 to express the same sentiment informally.
  - english: This morning, in addition to the cold rain, strong winds are also blowing.

          - 今朝 は 冷たい 雨、さらに 強い 風 も 吹い て おり ます。
        english: This morning, cold rain, furthermore, strong winds are also blowing.
        hint: 「さらに」 simply adds another piece of information. We're looking for an expression that emphasizes
          an accumulated effect where one thing adds to another, rather than just sequential addition.
    scene: A weather report broadcast on a morning news program.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The formal politeness marker 「〜おります」 at the end of the sentence indicates a professional and
      informative tone suitable for a weather forecast. The use of 「に加えて」 here highlights the combination
      of two adverse weather conditions, rain and strong wind, intensifying the overall negative weather
      picture for the listener/viewer.
  - english: I want to be able to speak French in addition to English.

        english: Not just English, but also French, I want to be able to speak.
        hint: 「だけでなく」 emphasizes that it's 'not just' the first item, but also the second. We're looking
          for a more direct additive relationship, emphasizing the cumulative growth of skills.
    scene: A university student discusses their aspirations with their academic advisor.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: The use of 「〜たいです」 expresses a desire in a polite yet direct manner, common in academic or
      career counseling settings. 「に加えて」 signifies a deliberate expansion of skills, indicating the speaker's
      ambition to add French proficiency to their existing English ability, showing an additive growth
      in their language repertoire.

        english: Professor Yamada is good at teaching, and then, he earnestly helps with students' consultations.
        hint: 「そして」 connects sequential actions or ideas. We're looking for an expression that adds an
          additional, notable point. This is an addition of a noteworthy quality rather than a sequence
          of events, making 「その上」 more suitable for emphasizing the layered attributes of the professor's
          character.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 山田 先生 は 教え 方 が 上手 で、それ に、生徒 の 相談 に も 熱心 に 乗っ て くれ ます。
        english: Professor Yamada is good at teaching, and in addition, he earnestly helps with students'
          consultations.
        hint: 「それに」 adds information, but 「その上」 places more emphasis on the additional point as a significant
          positive aspect. While 「それに」 simply adds another piece of information, 「その上」 is used here to
          present a second, equally significant positive aspect, highlighting a cumulative positive impression
          of the professor.
    scene: A university student praising their professor to a friend.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: The use of 「先生」 and polite forms like 「乗ってくれます」 maintains a respectful and informative tone,
      appropriate for discussing a professor's qualities. 「その上」 is used to add a significant, positive
      attribute, building on the initial positive statement about teaching ability by adding another valuable
      characteristic. This reinforces the professor's overall positive image by layering admirable qualities.
  - english: The used car I bought recently has bad fuel economy, and moreover, repair costs are high,

          also high, so I want to get rid of it already.
        hint: 「それに」 adds information, but 「その上」 emphasizes the cumulative nature of the problems, making
          the situation worse. Here, 「その上」 clearly presents the second problem as an additional, equally
          weighty reason for dissatisfaction, emphasizing the accumulating difficulties with the car.
      - competing_japanese:

        english: The used car I recently bought has bad fuel economy, and to make matters worse, repair
          costs are also high, so I want to get rid of it already.
        hint: 「おまけに」 implies a negative addition that exacerbates the situation. While similar, 「その上」
          is more neutral for simply stacking issues. 「おまけに」 has a stronger implication of an 'extra'
          negative, almost like 'to top it off'. 「その上」 functions more as a straightforward listing of
          another significant problem.
    scene: Someone complaining to a friend about a recent purchase.
    register: casual
    setting: melancholic
    nuance: The plain forms like 「悪くて」 and 「手放したい」 contribute to the casual, complaining tone. 「その上」 is
      used to add a second, equally frustrating problem to the first, justifying the desire to get rid
      of the car. It effectively emphasizes the combination of issues, making the speaker's plight more
      understandable.

        english: This laptop is light and easy to carry. In addition, the battery life is also good.
        hint: 「それに」 is a general additive particle. 「しかも」 provides a stronger sense of reinforcing the
          preceding statement with something significant or unexpected. We're looking for a grammar point
          that strongly emphasizes the importance of the added information.
    scene: A person is enthusiastically describing their new laptop to a friend, highlighting its desirable

          housework.
        hint: 「おまけに」 often suggests an unexpected bonus or downside, like 'to top it all off.' 「しかも」 implies
          the added information significantly reinforces the initial point. We're looking for a phrase
          that adds significant, reinforcing information.
    scene: A mother proudly talking to her close friend about her son's commendable qualities.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The sentence ends with 「～くれるんだよ」, which is a soft, explanatory, and slightly emphatic ending
      often used by female speakers to share positive news or observations in casual conversation. 「手伝って
      くれる」 also highlights the son doing something *for* the speaker, which is a common expression of
      gratitude, reinforcing the positive sentiment.

          point. We're looking for a way to emphasize a compounding negative factor.
    scene: Two coworkers are complaining about a recent dining experience during a lunch break.
    register: casual

        english: The new product's performance has improved, and on top of that, the price has also been
          kept down.
        hint: 「その上」 is a neutral way to add information, meaning 'on top of that.' 「しかも」 adds a stronger
          emphasis on the importance or surprising nature of the additional point. We're looking for a
          phrase that highlights a significant additional achievement.
    scene: A manager is presenting a new product to potential investors, highlighting its competitive
      advantages.
    register: formal
    setting: professional
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The use of formal language like 「向上 し」 and 「抑えられました」 alongside 「しかも」 in a professional presentation
      underscores the significant dual achievements of improved performance and cost-effectiveness.

        english: Climbing Mt. Fuji is difficult, and further, there's a possibility of sudden weather
          changes.
        hint: 「さらに」 indicates 'even more' or 'further' in terms of progression or intensity. 「しかも」 introduces
          an additional, reinforcing piece of information that adds weight to the initial point. We're
          looking for a way to state an additional, impactful risk.
    scene: A mountaineering club leader is explaining the potential risks of an upcoming climb to new,
      inexperienced members.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: instructional
    listener_gender: group
    speaker_age: older

      an additional, serious factor on top of the inherent difficulty of the climb. This is appropriate
      for warning new members.

        english: His room is small, and to make matters worse, things are scattered everywhere.
        hint: 「おまけに」 suggests an unexpected negative addition, often 'to make matters worse.' 「しかも」 emphasizes
          that the added messiness is a significant reinforcement of the room's negative qualities. We're
          looking for a phrase to highlight a compounding negative factor.
    scene: A parent is describing their son's persistently messy room to another family member with a
      sigh of resignation.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: The speaker uses 「狭く、しかも」 to list two negative attributes of the room, with 「しかも」 emphasizing
      that the messiness is an additional, exacerbating problem on top of its small size. The casual register
      fits a personal complaint.
post_example_writeup: These examples illustrate the varied applications of 「それに」, 「加えて」, 「その上」, and 「しかも」.
  Remember that 「それに」 often implies tone consistency and a straightforward addition, while 「加えて」 is more
  formal and emphasizes augmentation. 「その上」 suggests a significant or cumulative addition, and 「しかも」 signals
  a strong, sometimes surprising, reinforcement or additional factor. Choosing the right expression depends
  on the specific context, desired nuance, and level of formality.
