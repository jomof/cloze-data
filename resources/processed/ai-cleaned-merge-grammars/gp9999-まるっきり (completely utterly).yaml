meaning: completely, utterly, entirely
pronunciation:
  katakana: マルッキリ
  romaji: marukkiri
formation:
  まるっきり + Negative form (動詞ない・形容詞ない・名詞ではないなど): Emphasizes complete absence or non-occurrence.
  まるっきり + Affirmative form (動詞ます・です・形容詞ですなど): Less common usage, for strong emphasis or surprise.
jlpt: N2
etymology: The word 「まるっきり」 originates from 「丸切り」 (marukiri). 「丸」 (maru) means 'whole' or 'entire,' and
  「切り」 (kiri) implies 'cutting' or 'division.' This combination suggests a complete and thorough separation
  or demarcation, leading to its meaning of 'completely' or 'entirely,' especially emphasizing a complete
  absence or distinct difference.
writeup: 「まるっきり」 is an adverb meaning "completely," "utterly," or "entirely." Its most frequent and natural
  usage is with negative verb or adjective forms to strongly emphasize a total lack or absence of something,
  akin to "not at all" or "not in the least." For example, 「まるっきり分からない」 conveys "I completely don't understand."
  While it shares semantic space with adverbs like 「全然」 and 「全く」, 「まるっきり」 often imparts a stronger, more
  absolute sense of negation or complete difference, sometimes with a nuance of surprise or unexpectedness
  at the totality. Although less common, 「まるっきり」 can occasionally precede affirmative statements for heightened
  emphasis, signifying "completely" or "absolutely." This affirmative usage is typically more nuanced
  and might suggest an an unexpected or striking completeness.

  - term: 全然 (zenzen)
    meaning: not at all, completely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「全然」 is a widely used adverb of degree, commonly paired with negatives but also appearing
      with affirmatives in casual speech. 「まるっきり」 is generally stronger and more absolute, especially
      in negative contexts, and its affirmative use is significantly rarer and more specific in tone.
    grammar_point: 全然 (not at all; totally)
  - term: 全く (mattaku)
    meaning: completely, truly, indeed
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「全く」 is quite similar to 「全然」 when used with negatives, meaning "not at all." It also functions
      with affirmatives to mean "truly" or "indeed." 「まるっきり」, while conveying a similar sense of totality,
      tends to emphasize absolute completeness or difference with a slightly more informal or expressive
      feel than 「全く」.
    grammar_point: 全く〜ない (not at all)
  - term: 全く〜ない (mattaku ~ nai)
    meaning: not at all
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is a common negative construction. 「まるっきり〜ない」 often feels even more absolute or definitive
      than 「全く〜ない」, suggesting zero possibility or a complete and utter lack of something.
    grammar_point: 全く〜ない (not at all)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「まるっきり」, 「全然」, and 「全く」 all express totality, 「まるっきり」 often carries
  a stronger, more emphatic tone, particularly in negative constructions. Think of it as a definitive
  'absolutely not' or 'completely different.' 「全然」 is very common and can be more versatile in casual
  speech, while 「全く」 can also express 'truly' in positive contexts. When you want to convey a strong,
  undeniable absence or difference, 「まるっきり」 is a powerful choice.

        hint: While 「全然」 also means 'not at all', 「まるっきり」 conveys an even stronger sense of absolute lack

          degree.

      is 'utterly' not showing up or making an appearance. 「見せません」 is the polite form.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 「まるっきり」 is most powerfully employed with negative expressions
  to convey a complete absence or absolute difference. While its use with affirmative statements is less
  common, it still serves to heighten emphasis, often with a surprising or decisive nuance, as demonstrated
  in the example about being 'completely exhausted.' Understanding this primary function with negation
  will be key to using 「まるっきり」 effectively in your Japanese.
