        "[Verb/い-Adjective in dictionary form] + のも当然だ": "Expresses that something is a natural or expected outcome.",

    "meaning": "It is only natural that; It is no wonder",
    "details": {
        "usage-context": "General"
    },
    "etymology": "The grammar point 「のも当然だ」 combines the explanatory 「の」, the particle 「も」 indicating \"also\" or \"even,\" 「当然 (とうぜん)」 meaning \"natural\" or \"obvious,\" and the copula 「だ」. Therefore, the phrase literally translates to \"it is natural, also.\"",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「のも当然だ」 expresses that a certain event is an extremely natural result or an obvious consequence. While similar to 「て当然だ」, 「のも当然だ」 is more emphatic, conveying the firm sense that 'it is no wonder' (不思議ではない) or 'it is only natural' (当然のことだ). By using 「も」 instead of 「は」, the speaker can further emphasize the obviousness of the remark from their perspective. This construction follows verbs and い-adjectives in their dictionary form, or な-adjectives and nouns followed by な. While 「て当然だ」 is a relatively milder expression, such as 「幸せなのは当然だ」 (\"being happy is natural\"), 「のも当然だ」 carries a stronger, more assertive nuance, like 「幸せであるのも当然だ」 (\"it's natural that one would be happy\"). It more clearly separates and emphasizes the inevitability of the matter.",
