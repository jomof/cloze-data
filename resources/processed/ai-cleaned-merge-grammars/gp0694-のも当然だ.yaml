    "etymology": "The grammar point 「のも当然だ」 combines the explanatory 「の」, the particle 「も」 indicating \"also\" or \"even,\" 「当然 (とうぜん)」 meaning \"natural\" or \"obvious,\" and the copula 「だ」. Therefore, the phrase literally translates to \"it is natural, also.\"",
    "writeup": "「のも当然だ」 is used to express that something is a natural or expected outcome. It's similar to 「て当然だ」, but 「のも当然だ」 is often perceived as slightly stronger, emphasizing that something is \"no wonder\" or \"only natural\". 「も」 can replace 「は」 to add extra emphasis. This grammar point follows verbs and い-adjectives in their dictionary form, or な-adjectives and nouns followed by 「な」. It's a versatile expression for conveying the obviousness of a situation.",
