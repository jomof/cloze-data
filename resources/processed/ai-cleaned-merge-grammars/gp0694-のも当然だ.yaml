    "etymology": "「の」 is a nominalizer, turning a clause into a noun phrase. 「も」 adds emphasis, in this case, emphasizing the naturalness of the situation. 「当然」 means \"natural\" or \"of course.\" 「だ」 is the plain copula.",
    "writeup": "「のも当然だ」 is used to express that something is natural, obvious, or no wonder. It's similar to 「て当然だ」, but slightly stronger, creating a greater separation between the prior statement and the speaker's sense of what's natural. \n\n*   It follows verbs and い-adjectives in their plain forms.\n*   For な-adjectives and nouns, attach 「な」 before 「のも当然だ」.\n*   Replacing 「は」 with 「も」 adds extra emphasis on the obviousness of the statement.",
