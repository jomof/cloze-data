    "etymology": "The phrase 「いつの間にか」 is composed of 「いつ」 (when), 「の」 (possessive particle), 「間」 (interval), 「に」 (particle), and 「か」 (question particle). Literally, it highlights an unknown interval within which something occurred, as if questioning when it happened.",
    "writeup": "「いつの間にか」 is a set expression that functions as a standalone adverb. It conveys the meaning of \"suddenly,\" \"unnoticed,\" or \"without realizing.\" It highlights an unknown interval within which something occurred. The inclusion of 「か」 often adds a nuance of surprise. A similar expression without the surprise nuance is 「あっという間に」, which means \"in the blink of an eye.\"",
