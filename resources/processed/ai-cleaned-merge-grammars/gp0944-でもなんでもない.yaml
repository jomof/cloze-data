    "etymology": "This grammar point is a combination of 「でも」 (even), 「何でも」 (anything at all), and 「ない」 (not). The literal translation, 'not even (A) or anything of the sort,' captures the intended nuance.",
    "writeup": "「でもなんでもない」 is used after nouns or *na*-adjectives to emphasize that something is \"definitely not (A)\" or \"not (A) at all.\" It combines 「でも」 (even), 「何でも」 (anything at all), and 「ない」 (not). The literal translation, \"not even (A) or anything of the sort,\" reflects this nuance.\n\n「でもなんでもない」 can be used positively or negatively. When used positively, it often translates to \"(A) is no big deal.\"\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\nSome sources list the conjunctive form of *i*-adjectives partnered with 「もなんでもない」 as another possibility, but this is less common.",

            "register": "semi-formal",
            "setting": "informative",
            "nuance": "The sentence employs polite speech (「です」, 「ます」), making it suitable for interacting with someone you're not particularly close to or someone older than you. 「なんか」 is used casually.",
