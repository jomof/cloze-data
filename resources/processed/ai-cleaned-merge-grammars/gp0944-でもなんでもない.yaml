    "etymology": "The grammar point 「でもなんでもない」 is formed by combining 「でも」 (even), 「何でも」 (anything), and 「ない」 (not). The 「でも」 adds emphasis, indicating that something is 'not even' or 'not in the slightest'. 「何でも」 broadens the scope to include 'anything of the kind'. Together, they create a strong negation.",
    "writeup": "「でもなんでもない」 is used after nouns or *na*-adjectives to strongly deny or negate something. It conveys the meaning of \"not at all,\" \"by no means,\" or \"definitely not.\" The literal translation of \"not even (A) or anything of the sort\" accurately reflects the nuance. While primarily used for negation, it can also express that something is \"no big deal\" in certain contexts. It's versatile and commonly used in everyday speech to emphasize the absence of a particular quality or characteristic.",
