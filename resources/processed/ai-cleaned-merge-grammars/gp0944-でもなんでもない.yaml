    "etymology": "The grammar point 「でもなんでもない」 is formed by combining 「でも」 (even), 「何でも」 (anything), and 「ない」 (not). The 「でも」 adds emphasis, indicating that something is 'not even' or 'not in the slightest'. 「何でも」 broadens the scope to include 'anything of the kind'. Together, they create a strong negation.",
    "writeup": "「でもなんでもない」 is used after nouns or な-adjectives to strongly deny or negate something. It conveys the meaning of \"not at all,\" \"by no means,\" or \"definitely not.\" The literal translation of \"not even (A) or anything of the sort\" accurately reflects the nuance. Although 「でもなんでもない」 is a negative construction, the overall statement can convey a positive or reassuring nuance, as seen in expressions like \"It's not bothersome at all.\" It's versatile and commonly used in everyday speech to emphasize the absence of a particular quality or characteristic. Although not as common, some sources list the conjunctive form of い-Adjectives partnered with もなんでもない as another possibility.",

            "english_literally": "He is doctor not at all. Just pharmacist.",
            "scene": "Ken is casually correcting his friend Hiroshi, who mistakenly thought their mutual acquaintance was a medical doctor.",

                    "mitigation": "The scene implies a strong correction of a persistent misconception. The phrase \"not a doctor at all\" emphasizes the absolute absence of that quality, which \"医者じゃない\" might not fully convey, making 「でもなんでもない」 more suitable for a definitive clarification."
