meaning: if (it is a na-adjective), then; as for (a na-adjective), then
pronunciation:
  katakana: ナラ
  romaji: nara
formation:
  な-Adjective (stem) + なら: Used when the condition is based on a na-adjective, often implying 'if that's
    the case'.
jlpt: N4
etymology: The conditional particle 「なら」 is derived from the classical Japanese auxiliary verb 「なり」, which
  functioned as a copula and could also indicate a conjecture or a condition. The form なら itself comes
  from the conjunctive form of 「なり」. When attached to a な-adjective, it functions similarly to how it
  does with nouns or noun phrases, implying "if it is [na-adjective]" or "if [na-adjective] is the case."
  This connection to the copula 「なり」 highlights its role in stating a condition or an assumed fact before
  proceeding with a statement, advice, or observation.
writeup: |-
  The grammar point な-Adjective + なら is used to form a conditional statement where the condition is based on a な-adjective. It essentially means "if it is [na-adjective]" or "if [na-adjective] is the case." This conditional form is frequently used to provide advice, suggestions, or to express a reaction to a situation that is presumed or has just been mentioned.

  Unlike other conditional forms like 「ば」 or 「たら」 that can indicate a general cause-and-effect or a hypothetical situation, 「なら」 often operates by taking the preceding statement or situation as a given. It implies "if what you said is true," or "if that's the situation." For example, if someone states, 「静かです」(It's quiet), you might respond, 「静かなら、ゆっくり本が読めますね」(If it's quiet, you can read a book slowly, can't you?). Here, the quietness is taken as an established fact.

  The structure is simple: just attach なら to the stem of a な-adjective. For example, 「きれい」 (clean/beautiful) becomes 「きれいなら」 (if it's clean/beautiful). This form is quite versatile and can be used in both casual and polite contexts, depending on the politeness level of the subsequent clause.

  Key characteristics of な-Adjective + なら:
  *   **Implied Assumption**: It often implies that the condition is already known or has just been stated by the other party.
  *   **Contextual**: It's highly dependent on the preceding context or conversation.
  *   **Recommendations/Reactions**: Frequently used to give advice, suggest alternatives, or express a logical consequence based on the established condition.

  - term: Verb[えば] (conditional)
    meaning: if (verb)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Verb[えば] (conditional) indicates a general, often natural, condition-consequence relationship.
      It doesn't carry the "if that's the case" nuance of な-Adjective[なら], which often responds to an
      assumed or stated condition.
    grammar_point: Verb[えば] (conditional)
  - term: たら (conditional, when・if A then B)
    meaning: if, when
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: たら is a general conditional that can imply sequence ("when A, then B") or a hypothetical situation.
      While flexible, it lacks the specific "if that's the case/as for X" responsive nuance often found
      with な-Adjective[なら]. It can also connect to a wider range of predicates.
    grammar_point: たら (conditional, when・if A then B)
  - term: と (conditional, inevitable result)
    meaning: if, when (inevitable result)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: と implies an inevitable or natural consequence. If A happens, B *always* happens. This is
      much stronger and less flexible than な-Adjective[なら], which simply states a condition for a particular
      situation or advice.
    grammar_point: と (conditional, inevitable result)
  - term: なら (conditional, if it's the case that A)
    meaning: if (it is the case that A)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This is the general なら conditional particle, which can attach to nouns, plain verbs, and verb-phrases.
      Our current grammar point specifically focuses on its usage with な-adjectives. While functionally
      similar, this broader なら can set a topic or context beyond simply stating "if it is X adjective."
    grammar_point: なら (conditional, if it's the case that A)
post_false_friends_writeup: While Japanese has several ways to express conditional statements, な-Adjective[なら]
  specifically focuses on conditions derived from な-adjectives. It's crucial to understand that な-Adjective[なら]
  often implies a response to a situation already known or stated. For instance, if someone says the room
  is 「静か」(shizuka - quiet), you might use 「静かなら」(shizuka nara - if it's quiet...) to suggest an action
  or comment. Other conditional forms like 「〜ば」, 「〜たら」, and 「〜と」 have their own distinct nuances regarding
  the relationship between the condition and the result, or the timing of events. The general 「なら」 particle
  (without specifying な-adjectives) can be used more broadly with nouns and verbs to imply "as for X"
  or "if it's X," setting a topic or context, which is a related but distinct function from its role directly
  with な-adjective stems.

    japanese:
      - 便利 {なな ら}、駅 で 会い ましょう。

        english: If it's convenient, let's meet at the station.
        hint: 「〜たら」is a common conditional for stating a hypothetical or sequential condition. While similar,
          「〜なら」often implies a response to an existing situation or context. We're looking for a conditional
          that sets a context.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 便利 {で あれ ば}、駅 で 会い ましょう。
        english: If it is convenient, let's meet at the station.

        english: If it were safe, I would want to go to that park.
        hint: 「〜たら」can imply a hypothetical or a more general "if." 「〜なら」often takes the condition as

          to a situation.

        hint: 「〜と」often implies an inevitable or natural consequence. While sometimes interchangeable,
          「〜なら」is more suited for giving advice or suggestions based on an observation. We're looking
          for a conditional expressing advice based on a current state.

        hint: 「〜たら」is a versatile conditional, but 「〜なら」often directly follows a stated or assumed condition,
          providing a more direct response. We're looking for a conditional that reacts to a perceived
          situation.

        hint: 「〜であれば」is a more formal and stiff way to state a condition. While correct, 「〜ななら」is more

          for advice.

post_example_writeup: Understanding な-Adjective + なら requires attention to the existing context. It is
  often a direct response to a stated or implied situation involving a な-adjective, allowing for practical
  advice, suggestions, or logical conclusions to follow. Pay attention to how the speaker uses it to build
  upon shared understanding.
