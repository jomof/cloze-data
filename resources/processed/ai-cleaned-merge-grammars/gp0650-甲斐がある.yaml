    "etymology": "「甲斐」 originally referred to a region in present-day Yamanashi Prefecture, known for its skilled warriors. Over time, it came to mean \"effectiveness\" or \"worth,\" reflecting the region's reputation for producing capable individuals.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「甲斐がある」 expresses that something is \"worth doing\" or \"pays off.\" 「甲斐」 itself means \"worth\" or \"effect.\" It is often used after verbs or nouns to indicate that an action or effort was worthwhile. You will often see it in hiragana as 「かい」 or 「がい」. When following verbs, 「がい」 is used after the ます-stem, indicating a general sense of worth. 「かい」 can follow any standard verb form, emphasizing the tense of the verb. 「甲斐がない」 means something is \"not worth doing.\" This expression is primarily used when the speaker wants to convey that a positive result will come from something that is either difficult or unpleasant, validating the effort or hardship.",
