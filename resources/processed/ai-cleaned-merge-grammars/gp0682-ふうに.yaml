        "usage-context": "Used to describe actions or states as resembling something else, or being performed in a particular manner. Often used with verbs of perception (e.g., 見える - to seem, to appear) or verbs of action (e.g., 振る舞う - to behave).",
        "function": "It modifies verbs or entire clauses, indicating the manner, style, or perceived appearance of an action or state.",
        "nuance": "「ふうに」 conveys a sense of superficial appearance or how something is perceived to be, often implying a resemblance or imitation rather than a direct, objective fact. It focuses on the 'way' something is done or appears, which may or may not reflect the underlying reality.",
        "grammatical-role": "Functions adverbially within a sentence."
    },
    "etymology": "The word 「ふう」 (fuu) is derived from the kanji 「風」 (kaze), meaning \"wind\" or \"air.\" In this grammatical context, it evolved to encompass the meaning of \"appearance,\" \"style,\" or \"manner.\" This connection can be intuitively understood as having \"an air of\" something, or perceiving something in a certain \"fashion\" or \"style.\" While the direct translation of \"wind\" is not present, the metaphorical sense of outward presentation or character remains.",
    "writeup": "「ふうに」 is a valuable Japanese phrase used to describe the **manner**, **style**, or **perceived appearance** of an action or state. It indicates that something is done *in the style of*, *in the manner of*, or *as if* something else.\n\nIt primarily appears in two common formations:\n\n*   **Verb Plain Form + ふうに**: When attached to the plain form of a verb, it describes how an action is performed or how a state appears. For instance, 「話すふうに」 would mean \"in a way that suggests speaking\" or \"as if speaking.\"\n\n*   **Pre-noun Adjective (こんな, そんな, あんな, どんな) + ふうに**: When used with these demonstrative pre-noun adjectives, 「ふうに」 directly refers to a specific manner or way that is being indicated. For example, 「こんなふうに」 means \"in this way\" or \"like this.\"\n\nCrucially, 「ふうに」 is always followed by the particle 「に」, which solidifies its adverbial function. This allows it to modify subsequent verbs, explaining *how* something is done or *how* it appears.\n\nA key nuance of 「ふうに」 is its emphasis on **perception or impression**. It often suggests that something *looks* or *seems* a certain way, even if the underlying reality might be different. It can be used to describe both genuine resemblances and superficial or even deceptive appearances.",

            "nuance": "Unlike 「ふうに」, 「のように」 and 「のような」 are used to compare nouns directly, stating that something is similar to another thing. 「ふうに」 describes *how* something is done or appears, emphasizing the manner or style."

            "nuance": "「ように」 and 「ような」 are more direct comparisons or indicate a purpose. While they can describe resemblance, 「ふうに」 often implies a more nuanced or sometimes superficial imitation or semblance of something, focusing on the *perceived* way."
