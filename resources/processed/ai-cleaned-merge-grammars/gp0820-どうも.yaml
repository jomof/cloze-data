    "etymology": "The etymology of 「どうも」 is complex, tracing back to older Japanese where 「どう」 meant \"how\" or \"in what way,\" and 「も」 added emphasis. Over time, it evolved to express various nuanced meanings, including uncertainty, difficulty, or general acknowledgement.",
    "writeup": "「どうも」 is a highly versatile Japanese adverb with multiple meanings and usages, often implying a sense of ambiguity, difficulty, or a general acknowledgment. Its precise meaning is heavily dependent on context and the surrounding words. It can be used to express:\n\n*   **Difficulty or inability:** When paired with a negative verb or adjective, 「どうも」 indicates that something is not going well, is difficult to achieve, or cannot be done easily, often implying a subtle, almost unexplainable, resistance. For example, 「{どうも}分からない」 implies \"I just can't quite understand it, for some reason.\" or \"I'm having trouble understanding it.\"\n*   **Conjecture or impression:** When followed by expressions like 「らしい」 or 「ようだ」, 「どうも」 suggests a strong impression, hunch, or conjecture based on indirect evidence. For example, 「{どうも}疲れているようだ」 means \"It seems like they're tired, for some reason\" or \"I get the impression they're tired.\"\n*   **General acknowledgment/versatile expression:** Used alone, 「どうも」 can serve as a casual, condensed expression of gratitude, apology, or even a greeting. Its specific meaning in such cases is entirely derived from the immediate situation, tone of voice, and body language. For instance, a quick 「{どうも}」 can mean \"Thanks,\" \"Sorry,\" or \"Hello\" depending on the context. While versatile, it is often followed by a more specific phrase like 「ありがとう」 or 「すみません」 for clarity and politeness, especially in formal settings.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   The strength of the ",
