    "writeup": "「どうも」 is a versatile Japanese word with multiple meanings and usages. It can express:\n\n*   Difficulty or inability: Used with a negative verb or adjective to indicate that something is not going well or cannot be done easily. For example, 「どうも分からない」 means \"I can't quite understand.\"\n*   Conjecture or impression: Used with 「らしい」 or 「ようだ」 to express a guess or feeling based on limited information. For example, 「どうも疲れているようだ」 means \"It seems like I'm tired.\"\n*   Gratitude, apology, or greeting: Used alone as a shortened, versatile expression of thanks, apology, or a casual greeting. The specific meaning depends on the context and tone.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   Context is crucial for understanding the meaning of 「どうも」. Pay attention to the surrounding words and the situation.\n*   「どうも」 can soften the impact of a statement, making it less direct or assertive.\n*   As a greeting or expression of gratitude/apology, 「どうも」 is often followed by 「ありがとう」, 「すみません」, etc., for added politeness.",
