    "etymology": "The kanji 分 originally meant \"to divide\" or \"to separate.\" Its use as a suffix to indicate an amount or portion stems from this concept of dividing something into parts or shares.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「分 (ぶん)」 indicates an amount, portion, or share of something. It attaches to a preceding noun, or a number and counter.\n\nWhen used with a **number and counter**, it means \"worth that amount\" or \"equivalent to that amount.\" For example, 「十ドル分 (じゅうドルぶん)」 means \"ten dollars worth.\" When used with a **noun**, it indicates the amount or portion of something represented by that noun. For example, 「不足分 (ふそくぶん)」 means \"the remaining amount.\" The kanji for 分 is N5.",
