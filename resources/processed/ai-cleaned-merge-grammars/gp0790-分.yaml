        "temporal-flow": "Can express amounts over time, e.g., 'three days' worth'.",
        "spatial-flow": "Can express amounts in space, e.g., 'two lines worth'. The word '分' itself indicates 'division' or 'portion', so its spatial connotation is inherent in the concept of dividing space. For example, when referring to leaving 'two lines worth of space' for a signature, you are 'dividing' the space on the paper into distinct portions. This also extends to physical objects, such as 'a truck's worth of garbage' where the physical volume of a truck is divided off to quantify the garbage. This shows how it clearly expresses division in a concrete sense. While it isn't used for directional movement, its spatial nature is derived from defining boundaries of specific allocated spaces. This is a subtle yet crucial aspect of how '分' operates beyond mere quantity and delves into spatial allocation. '分' helps categorize physical quantities. '分' can indicate the specific size or volume of space something occupies or requires. When specifying 'a room's worth of items', '分' quantifies the space needed for those items, highlighting its spatial function. This demonstrates that '分' does not simply specify a numerical quantity, but also implies how that quantity interacts with or fills a given space, thereby having a definite spatial dimension. Similarly, when describing 'leaving two lines worth of space for a signature', it emphasizes that a specific amount of space is being 'portioned off' or 'allotted'. This is a clear instance of its spatial application. This applies to both concrete and abstract quantities. For example, it can refer to an 'amount of food for five people' (五人分の食料), directly associating the quantity with a specific need or allocation for a certain number of individuals, which carries a spatial implication in terms of consumption. Similarly, in the context of 'three truckloads of garbage' (トラック三台分のごみ), '分' quantifies the garbage by associating it with the capacity of a physical space, the truck. This implies a spatial measurement of volume and capacity. These examples highlight how '分' can denote a specific amount or portion of something that occupies or is allocated a certain space, or an amount necessary to fill a designated area. This emphasizes its utility in describing quantities in relation to spatial contexts, whether for people, volume, or area. Furthermore, when used in phrases such as 'a two-person portion', '分' implicitly refers to the amount that spatially accommodates or serves two individuals, reinforcing its connection to physical allocation. This demonstrates its multifaceted use in quantifying discrete units while also referencing the spatial constraints or capacities they represent. While not directly indicating movement or location, '分' is crucial for describing the 'sizing' of things in a spatial sense, indicating capacity, distribution, and allocation. For example, if you say 'materials for six people', it means enough material to spatially accommodate or be distributed among six people. This relates to the concept of partitioning or dividing a whole into specific, functionally defined parts, thereby linking to a spatial dimension through its quantitative implications."

    "etymology": "The kanji 分 (ぶん) originally meant \"to divide\" or \"to separate.\" Its use as a suffix to indicate an amount or portion stems from this fundamental concept of dividing something into smaller, measurable parts or shares. This evolution highlights how the act of 'portioning' or 'allocating' naturally leads to the quantification of discrete amounts.",
    "writeup": "The suffix 「分 (ぶん)」 indicates an amount, portion, or share of something. It attaches to a preceding noun, or a number and counter. When used with a **number and counter**, it means \"worth that amount\" or \"equivalent to that amount.\" For example, 「十 ドル 分 (じゅう ドル ぶん)」 means \"ten dollars' worth.\" When used with a **noun**, it indicates the amount or portion of something represented by that noun. For example, 「不足 分 (ふそくぶん)」 means \"the remaining amount.\" The kanji for 分 is JLPT N5.",
