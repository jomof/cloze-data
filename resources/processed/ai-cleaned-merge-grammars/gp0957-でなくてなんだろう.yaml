        "function": "To assert undeniable truth; to express strong conviction through a rhetorical question.",
        "nuance": "Carries a tone of strong, undeniable conviction, often with a rhetorical flourish that implies the answer is obvious. It demands agreement or challenges the listener to propose an alternative that is clearly impossible. It is more emphatic and rhetorical than simple statements of certainty.",

    },
    "etymology": "This grammar point is constructed from で (the conjunctive form of the copula だ), なくて (the conjunctive form of the negative ない), なん (what), and だろう (the volitional form of だ, expressing conjecture or rhetorical question). It literally asks, \"If it is not this, then what could it be?\" This construction highlights the lack of any plausible alternative, thus reinforcing the initial assertion.",
    "writeup": "「でなくてなんだろう」 is a formal and emphatic pattern used to express a strong conviction that something is undoubtedly a certain way. It often takes the form of a rhetorical question, asserting the speaker's opinion so strongly that no other possibility seems conceivable. The expression can be translated as \"If it isn't (A), then what is it?\" or \"What else could it be if not (A)?\"\n\nThis pattern is typically used to emphasize a point or express a powerful, undeniable opinion. It is a highly assertive rhetorical device. While it functions as a question, it implicitly conveys a definitive statement.\n\nIt is commonly used in formal or semi-formal contexts, particularly when the speaker wishes to convey a sense of profound truth or an unavoidable conclusion. It can sometimes be followed by the sentence-ending particle 「か」 for added rhetorical emphasis, which does not change its core meaning.",
