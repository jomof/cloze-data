        "usage-context": "Used when the nominalized sentence expresses a directly perceptible event or a fact already known or obvious to both the speaker and listener.",
        "function": "Nominalizer (turns a clause into a noun phrase).",
        "nuance": "This usage of 「の」 is generally more concrete and relates to sensory information or shared knowledge, in contrast to 「こと」 which often handles more abstract concepts."
    },
    "etymology": "The particle 「の」 originally derives from the possessive particle 「の」, indicating a connection or belonging. In its function as a nominalizer, it retains a sense of specifying or highlighting a particular aspect or action within the context, making the preceding clause function as a 'thing' or 'event'.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「の」 functions as a **nominalizer**, transforming a clause (a phrase that contains a verb, adjective, or noun) into a noun phrase. It's used when the content of the clause is something directly perceived, or a fact already understood by both the speaker and listener. Unlike 「こと」, which is generally used for abstract ideas, 「の」 is typically more concrete, relating to sensory information or shared knowledge. \n\nWhen nominalizing verbs and い-adjectives, the plain form is directly followed by 「の」. For な-adjectives and nouns, 「な」 is inserted between the word and 「の」. The resulting noun phrase can then function as the subject, object, or other noun-like element in a sentence.\n\n「の」 can also soften a statement or question, often implying a shared understanding or a personal observation. This often occurs when 「の」 is used sentence-finally, sometimes followed by other particles like 「だ」 or 「です」, creating forms like 「のです」 or 「のだ」, which can convey explanation or assertion with a softer tone.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "To differentiate between 「の」 and 「こと」, remember that 「の」 typically relates to direct experiences, sensory perceptions, or facts already known or obvious to both parties. If you can directly see, hear, or feel the action or state being nominalized, 「の」 is often the more appropriate choice. 「こと」, on the other hand, refers to more abstract ideas, general truths, or habitual actions. 「もの」 is distinct as it exclusively refers to a concrete, physical object.",

            "nuance": "「の」 is used here because the action of singing is a directly perceived event through hearing. It implies a sensory experience, which is why it's distinct from 「こと」, which would be ungrammatical for direct perception. The casual register fits the conversation between friends."
