formation:
  Verb (plain form) + の: Used to nominalize a verb clause, transforming the action or state into a noun.
  い-adjective (plain form) + の: Used to nominalize an i-adjective clause, referring to the quality or
    state as a noun.
  な-adjective (plain form) + な + の: Used to nominalize a na-adjective clause, referring to the characteristic
    or state as a noun.
  Noun + な + の: Used to nominalize a noun clause, referring to the identity or status as a noun.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The particle の originally derives from the possessive particle の, indicating a connection or
  belonging. In its function as a nominalizer, it retains a sense of specifying or highlighting a particular
  aspect or action within the context, making the preceding clause function as a 'thing' or 'event'.
writeup: "The particle の functions as a **nominalizer**, transforming a clause (a phrase that contains\
  \ a verb, adjective, or noun) into a noun phrase. It's used when the content of the clause is something\
  \ directly perceived, or a fact already understood by both the speaker and listener. Unlike こと, which\
  \ is generally used for abstract ideas, の is typically more concrete, relating to sensory information\
  \ or shared knowledge. \n\nWhen nominalizing verbs and い-adjectives, the plain form is directly followed\
  \ by の. For な-adjectives and nouns, な is inserted between the word and の. The resulting noun phrase\
  \ can then function as the subject, object, or other noun-like element in a sentence.\n\nの can also\
  \ soften a statement or question, often implying a shared understanding or a personal observation. This\
  \ often occurs when の is used sentence-finally, sometimes followed by other particles like だ or です,\
  \ creating forms like のです or のだ, which can convey explanation or assertion with a softer tone."
false_friends:
  - term: こと
    meaning: Thing, matter, fact, abstract concept
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike の, こと is generally used for abstract concepts, general truths, and habitual actions.
      It cannot be used for directly perceived events.
    grammar_point: '[Clause]こと (the act of・the fact that)'
  - term: もの
    meaning: Thing, object (tangible)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: もの refers to a concrete, tangible object, whereas の nominalizes a clause or idea into a conceptual
      'thing' or 'event'.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:もの (tangible object)
post_false_friends_writeup: To differentiate between の and こと, remember that の typically relates to direct
  experiences, sensory perceptions, or facts already known or obvious to both parties. If you can directly
  see, hear, or feel the action or state being nominalized, の is often the more appropriate choice. こと,
  on the other hand, refers to more abstract ideas, general truths, or habitual actions. もの is distinct
  as it exclusively refers to a concrete, physical object.
examples:
  - english: Studying kanji every day is fun.
    japanese:
      - 毎日 漢字 を 勉強 する {の} は 楽しい。
      - 毎日 漢字 を 勉強 する {の} は 楽しい です。
    english_literally: The daily kanji studying thing is fun.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 毎日 漢字 を 勉強 する {こと} は 楽しい。
        english: It is fun to study kanji every day.
        hint: While こと can also nominalize, の here emphasizes the speaker's direct experience and personal
          feeling about the action, making it more immediate. We're looking for an emphasis on the personal
          experience.
    scene: A student expressing their enjoyment of a task to a classmate.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of の here emphasizes the speaker's direct experience and feeling about the act of
      studying kanji, making the statement more personal and immediate than if こと were used. This aligns
      with a casual conversation among peers.
  - english: I heard him singing.
    japanese:
      - 彼 が 歌っ て いる {の} を 聞い た。
      - 彼 が 歌っ て いる {の} を 聞き まし た。
    english_literally: I heard the him singing thing.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が 歌っ て いる {こと} を 聞い た。
        english: I heard about him singing.
        hint: こと cannot be used for directly perceived events like hearing or seeing; it implies hearing
          about something abstractly. We're looking for direct sensory perception.
    scene: Two friends chatting about a recent concert they attended.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    nuance: の is used here because the action of singing is a directly perceived event through hearing.
      It implies a sensory experience, which is why it's distinct from こと, which would be ungrammatical
      for direct perception. The casual register fits the conversation between friends.
  - english: I'm not good with cold weather.
    japanese:
      - 寒い {の} は 苦手 だ。
      - 寒い {の} は 苦手 です。
    english_literally: The cold thing is my weakness.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 寒い {こと} は 苦手 だ。
        english: Being cold is something I'm not good at.
        hint: こと would make the statement more about the abstract concept of 'being cold', whereas の focuses
          on the concrete, personal feeling of discomfort. We're looking for a personal, experienced reality.
    scene: A person muttering to themselves as they shiver in a chilly room.
    register: casual
    setting: reflective
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: Here, の nominalizes the state of 'being cold,' conveying a concrete, personal feeling of discomfort.
      This usage highlights the immediate, experienced reality, which is why it's more appropriate than
      こと when talking about a physically felt condition. The informal 苦手 だ fits a self-reflection.
  - english: Seeing her well, I felt relieved.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 が 元気 な {の} を 見 て 安心 し た。
      - 彼女 が 元気 な {の} を 見 て 安心 し まし た。
    english_literally: Seeing her being well, I felt relieved.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 が 元気 な {こと} を 見 て 安心 し た。
        english: I felt relieved upon learning she was well.
        hint: Using こと here would imply 'learning that she was well' rather than 'seeing' it directly,
          as こと cannot be used for direct sensory observation. We're looking for direct observation.
    scene: A worried mother observing her daughter after a long illness.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: sympathetic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: This sentence employs の to nominalize the directly observed state of 'being well'. It implies
      a direct visual perception, making it distinct from the more abstract こと. The phrase 安心 し た (felt
      relieved) emphasizes the personal reaction to this observation. The semi-formal register is suitable
      for discussing such a topic.
  - english: I had forgotten that tomorrow was a holiday.
    japanese:
      - 明日 が 休み な {の} を 忘れ て い た。
      - 明日 が 休み な {の} を 忘れ て い まし た。
    english_literally: I had forgotten the thing that tomorrow is a holiday.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 明日 が 休み だ と いう {こと} を 忘れ て い た。
        english: I had forgotten the fact that tomorrow is a holiday.
        hint: While both can express forgotten facts, の emphasizes the specific event as a concrete 'thing'
          that was forgotten. こと focuses more on the general concept or fact.
    scene: A student suddenly remembering a holiday while planning their week.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: の here nominalizes a known fact, which was temporarily forgotten. This use focuses on the
      specific event of 'tomorrow being a holiday' rather than the general concept of holidays. The casual
      nature of forgetting something everyday is reflected in the informal language.
  - english: It's okay because I can go alone.
    japanese:
      - 一人 で 行ける {の} で 大丈夫 だ よ。
      - 一人 で 行ける {の} で 大丈夫 です よ。
      - 一人 で 行ける {の} で 大丈夫 だ。
    english_literally: Because it's the thing that I can go alone, it's okay.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 一人 で 行ける {から} 大丈夫 だ よ。
        english: It's okay because I can go alone.
        hint: While から states a reason, の で provides a softer, more explanatory reason, often implying
          a shared understanding or a more direct connection to the consequence. We're looking for a softer,
          more explanatory tone.
    scene: A young woman reassuring her concerned father that she doesn't need an escort.
    register: casual
    setting: persuasive
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The combination of の as a nominalizer and the sentence-final だ よ creates a soft, explanatory,
      and slightly persuasive tone, often used by younger female speakers when giving reasons or reassurance.
      一人 で 行ける の で focuses on the immediate, concrete possibility of going alone, making the argument
      feel more personal.
  - english: Sorry I'm late, the road was congested.
    japanese:
      - 遅れ て ごめん ね、道 が 混ん で い た {の}。
      - 遅れ て すみ ませ ん、道 が 混ん で い た {の} です。
    english_literally: Sorry for being late, it's that the road was congested.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 遅れ て ごめん ね、道 が 混ん で い た {から}。
        english: Sorry I'm late, because the road was congested.
        hint: The sentence-final の provides a softer, more explanatory tone than から, often implying shared
          context or empathy, making the apology feel less like an excuse. We're looking for a softer,
          more personal explanation.
    scene: A woman apologizing to her friend for being late to a casual meetup.
    register: casual
    setting: apologetic
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The sentence-final の in this context adds a soft, explanatory nuance, particularly common
      in female speech. It suggests the speaker is providing a reason and expects the listener to understand
      or empathize, making the apology feel less like an excuse and more like a shared observation of
      circumstances.
  - english: The reason I'm here is to pick up a package.
    japanese:
      - 荷物 を 受け取り に 来 た {の} です。
      - 荷物 を 受け取り に 来 た {ん} です。
      - 荷物 を 受け取り に 参り まし た {の} です。
    english_literally: It is that I came to receive a package.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 荷物 を 受け取り に {来 まし た}。
        english: I came to receive a package.
        hint: の です is used to provide an explanation or reason, softening the statement and implying a
          background context. We're looking for an explanation for why you're there.
    scene: At a post office, explaining the purpose of your visit to the staff.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: group
    nuance: The use of の です (often contracted to ん です in speech) explicitly states a reason or explanation
      for the current situation. It implies that the speaker is providing context or background information
      that the listener is expected to understand, softening the statement compared to a direct declaration.
      This is suitable for polite interactions.
  - english: Have you seen my car keys? I can't find them anywhere.
    japanese:
      - 私 の 車 の 鍵 を 見 た {の}？どこ に も 見つから ない ん だ けど。
      - 私 の 車 の 鍵 を 見 まし た {の}？どこ に も 見つから ない ん です けど。
      - 私 の 車 の 鍵 を 見 た {ん}？どこ に も 見つから ない ん だ けど。
    english_literally: Did you see my car's keys? It is that I can't find them anywhere.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の 車 の 鍵 を {見 まし た か}？どこ に も {見つかり ませ ん}。
        english: Did you see my car keys? I can't find them anywhere.
        hint: The sentence-final の？ is used for softer, more casual questions, often implying shared context
          or seeking confirmation with a gentle tone. We're looking for a casual inquiry in a familiar
          setting.
    scene: A person frantically searching for their car keys, asking a family member.
    register: casual
    setting: interrogative
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: male
    nuance: The sentence-final の？ is a very common way to form casual questions, particularly among female
      speakers, adding a softer, often inquisitive or explanatory tone, expecting a shared understanding.
      The following ん だ けど further softens the request, making it sound less demanding and more like a
      shared problem.
  - english: What he said was a complete lie!
    japanese:
      - 彼 が 言っ た {の} は 嘘 だ！
      - 彼 が 言っ た {の} は 嘘 です！
    english_literally: That which he said is a lie!
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が 言っ た {こと} は 嘘 だ！
        english: The fact that he said is a lie!
        hint: While こと can also nominalize facts, の can be used when the focus is on the specific action
          or event itself as a concrete 'thing' being discussed, often in a more direct or emphatic manner.
          We're looking to emphasize the statement itself as a falsehood.
    scene: Someone angrily refuting a statement made by another person.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: Here, の nominalizes the entire clause 彼 が 言っ た (what he said), making it the subject of the
      sentence. This direct nominalization allows the speaker to emphasize the falsity of that specific
      statement. The combination with the declarative だ！ makes the assertion strong and direct, common
      in casual, emotional speech.
post_example_writeup: As demonstrated, の as a nominalizer is remarkably versatile, allowing for the transformation
  of various clauses into noun phrases. Its strength lies in its ability to refer to events, states, or
  facts in a concrete, perceived manner, often conveying a sense of shared understanding or providing
  explanation. Pay close attention to context and the speaker's intent, as these often dictate the choice
  between の and other nominalizers like こと.
