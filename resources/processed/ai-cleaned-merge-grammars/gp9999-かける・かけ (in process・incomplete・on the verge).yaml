pronunciation:
  katakana: カケル・カケ
  romaji: kakeru・kake
formation:
  Verb[stem]かける: Indicates an action is in the middle of being performed or is about to start.
  Verb[stem]かけのNoun: Describes a noun that is in an incomplete state or an action applied to it is unfinished.
  Verb[stem]かけだ: States that an action is incomplete or half-done.
jlpt: N3
etymology: The verb かける (kakeru) has many meanings, including "to hang," "to begin to do," "to apply,"
  "to cover," etc. In this grammatical usage, its origin traces back to the meaning of "beginning to do"
  or "being halfway through." The idea of "hanging" something or "being suspended" can also contribute
  to the nuance of an action being "in progress" or "incomplete" and not yet "finished" or "brought down."
  The noun form かけ (kake) further emphasizes this state, implying a partial or unfinished condition.
writeup: 「かける」 and 「かけ」 are suffixes attached to the stem of a verb to indicate that an action is either
  **in progress**, **incomplete**, or **on the verge** of happening. When used as 「Verb[stem]かける」, it
  signifies that an action has begun and is still ongoing, or that it is about to begin. It often implies
  a sense of being "half-done" or "about to do." For example, 食べかける (tabe-kakeru) means "to start eating"
  or "to be in the middle of eating." This form can also suggest that the action was interrupted or left
  unfinished. The noun form 「Verb[stem]かけ」 is typically used to modify a noun, as in 「Verb[stem]かけのNoun」,
  or as a predicate 「Verb[stem]かけだ」. This form strongly emphasizes the **incompleteness** or **partial
  state** of the action. For instance, 読みかけの本 (yomi-kake no hon) refers to "a book that has been started
  but not finished." The nuance conveyed is often that of an action that has been initiated but not brought
  to completion, or one that is on the brink of completion. It highlights the unfinished nature of something.

  - term: Verb[stem]はじめる
    meaning: to start doing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「はじめる」 indicates a simple beginning of an action, without the implication of incompleteness
      or being on the verge that 「かける・かけ」 carries.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[stem]はじめる (to start doing)
  - term: Verb[stem]だす
    meaning: to suddenly start doing
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「だす」 emphasizes a sudden, often outward, beginning of an action, while 「かける・かけ」 focuses on
      the action being in progress or incomplete.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:Verb[stem]だす (to suddenly start doing)
  - term: ずじまい
    meaning: ended up not doing
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「ずじまい」 implies an action was ultimately not completed at all, whereas 「かける・かけ」 signifies an
      action was initiated or on the verge of completion.
    grammar_point: ずじまい (ended up not doing)
  - term: たて
    meaning: freshly done
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「たて」 describes something that has just been completed, which is the opposite of the incomplete
      state expressed by 「かける・かけ」.
    grammar_point: たて (freshly done)
  - term: Verb[て]いる
    meaning: ongoing state, habitual action, resultant state
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While 「Verb[て]いる」 indicates an ongoing action, it doesn't specifically convey the nuance of
      incompleteness or being on the verge, unlike 「かける・かけ」.
    grammar_point: '[Verb-て]いる (ongoing state・habitual action・resultant state)'
  - term: たばかり
    meaning: just did
    kind: antonym
    nuance: 「たばかり」 means an action was completed very recently, directly contrasting with 「かける・かけ」 which
      denotes an action that is unfinished or about to be.
    grammar_point: たばかり (just did)
post_false_friends_writeup: It's important to distinguish 「かける・かけ」 from other expressions of beginning
  or completion. While 「 Verb[stem]はじめる 」 and 「 Verb[stem]だす 」 both indicate the start of an action, they
  do not inherently suggest the action is unfinished or on the verge, as 「かける・かけ」 does. 「はじめる」 is a neutral
  start, and 「だす」 implies a sudden, outward initiation. Conversely, 「 ずじまい 」 denotes an action that was
  never completed, and 「 たて 」 signifies something freshly finished, both standing in direct contrast to
  the incomplete or nascent state implied by 「かける・かけ」. 「 Verb[て]いる 」 indicates an ongoing action or a
  resultant state but lacks the specific nuance of incompleteness or being on the verge that 「かける・かけ」
  carries.

  begun but is either interrupted, incomplete, or on the brink of completion. When used as 「かけ」, typically
  modifying a noun or as a predicate, it emphasizes the unfinished state of the action or object. This
  grammar point is highly versatile for expressing actions that are not fully realized, conveying a sense
  of being in progress or half-done.
