  Verb[dictionary form] + こと: Transforms a verb into a noun, indicating the action itself.
jlpt: N5
etymology: The Japanese word こと (事) originally referred to 'things,' 'affairs,' or 'matters.' Its use
  as a nominalizer allows verbs to be treated as such abstract concepts or facts. This evolution enables
  actions and situations to be conceptualized and discussed as discrete 'things' or 'events' within a
  sentence.
writeup: "The grammatical construct Verb[dictionary form]こと is a crucial nominalizer in Japanese, transforming\
  \ a verb or an entire verb clause into a noun phrase. This allows the action or state described by the\
  \ verb to be treated as a grammatical entity—a subject, object, or the topic of a sentence.\n\nWhen\
  \ a verb is followed by こと, it becomes a noun phrase representing the action or event itself. For example,\
  \ 読む (yomu - to read) becomes 読むこと (yomu koto - the act of reading / reading). This newly formed noun\
  \ phrase can then be used in various grammatical structures, much like any other noun.\n\nこと nominalization\
  \ is often used when discussing: \n- **General truths or concepts**: For instance, 水を飲むことは大切だ (Mizu\
  \ o nomu koto wa taisetsu da - Drinking water is important).\n- **Rules or instructions**: 走ることは禁止されている\
  \ (Hashiru koto wa kinshi sareteiru - Running is forbidden).\n- **Abilities or possibilities**: ピアノを弾くことができます\
  \ (Piano o hiku koto ga dekimasu - I can play the piano).\n- **Personal experiences or observations**:\
  \ 富士山に登ったことがある (Fujisan ni nobotta koto ga aru - I have climbed Mt. Fuji before).\n\nWhile こと and の\
  \ can both serve as nominalizers, こと generally carries a more objective, conceptual, or formal nuance.\
  \ It refers to the 'fact' or 'affair' of the action. の on the other hand, often nominalizes a specific\
  \ event that one perceives with the senses (seeing, hearing, feeling) or a more personal, subjective\
  \ experience. This distinction is subtle but important for natural Japanese expression."

  - term: Verb[dictionary form]の (nominalization)
    meaning: the act of doing; to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While both こと and の can nominalize verbs, の often implies a more specific, sensory, or personal
      observation of an action or state. こと objectifies the action as a general concept or fact.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:の (nominalization)
  - term: '[Clause]ことだ (should/ought to)'
    meaning: should do; ought to do; it is important to do
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This grammatical pattern expresses advice, recommendation, or a moral obligation. It uses
      ことだ as a fixed phrase with a prescriptive meaning, distinct from こと purely functioning as a nominalizer.
    grammar_point: ことだ (should・ought to)
  - term: '[Clause]ということ (the fact that)'
    meaning: the fact that; it means that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: This form typically introduces a statement as a reported fact or explains the meaning of a
      preceding statement. It emphasizes the content of the clause as a 'fact' or 'meaning,' whereas こと
      alone is a general nominalizer for the action.
    grammar_point: ということだ (it means that)
post_false_friends_writeup: When こと acts as a nominalizer, it transforms a verb into a noun phrase referring
  to the action or state itself as a concept. It's often used for general statements, rules, or when discussing
  'the matter of X.' In contrast, の nominalizes an action for a more subjective or sensory focus, often
  implying direct observation. For example, 彼の走ることを知っている (I know the fact of his running - perhaps his
  running technique) versus 彼が走るのを見た (I saw him running - a specific event). Patterns like ことだ or ということ
  are distinct grammatical structures that utilize こと but add specific meanings beyond simple nominalization.
  Remember to identify the core function of こと in context.
