etymology: The particle ばかり is thought to derive from the classical Japanese noun はかり (hakari), meaning
  'scale' or 'measurement,' and the verb はかる (hakaru), 'to measure' or 'to estimate.' This origin explains
  its core meaning of 'only' or 'just'—indicating a precise measurement or limit. Over time, its usage
  expanded to denote recent completion ('just finished'), exclusive action ('always doing nothing but'),
  and even 'full of' or 'almost,' all stemming from the fundamental idea of delimiting or quantifying.
writeup: |-
  ばかり is a versatile particle that functions primarily as a limiter, emphasizing exclusivity, or denoting a recent action. It can attach to nouns, various verb forms, and quantities, acquiring different shades of meaning depending on the context.

  One common use is to mean "only" or "just," similar to だけ. However, ばかり often carries an additional nuance of "nothing but" or "too much," implying that the speaker feels there is an excessive amount or an undesirable focus on that one thing. For example, テレビばかり見ている (always watching TV) implies that someone watches too much TV, often to the exclusion of other activities.

  It can also indicate that an action has just been completed, especially when paired with the past tense of a verb (たばかり). This usage conveys a sense of immediacy or freshness of the action, similar to English "just."

  Furthermore, ばかり can suggest that something is "full of" or "consists entirely of" a particular item or quality. When used with a dictionary form verb (Vるばかり), it can mean "only (doing X)" or "just about to (do X)," often highlighting a continuous, singular action.
false_friends:
  - term: だけ (only・just)
    meaning: only; merely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: だけ is a neutral limiter, simply stating a boundary. ばかり can imply either "only that (to the
      exclusion of others)" or "too much of that." When ばかり is used with a noun or verb to mean "only,"
      it often carries a nuance of exclusiveness or something being excessive, whereas だけ simply states
      "only."
    grammar_point: だけ (only・just)
  - term: しか〜ない (only, nothing but)
    meaning: only; nothing but
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: しか〜ない always requires a negative verb and emphasizes scarcity or a restrictive limit, often
      with a somewhat negative feeling. ばかり can be used with positive verbs and highlights exclusivity
      or excess without necessarily implying scarcity.
    grammar_point: しか〜ない (only, nothing but)
  - term: 〜きり (only・just)
    meaning: only; just; since (doing, and nothing else happened)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: きり suggests an absolute limit or an action/state that has continued unchanged since a specific
      point. For example, 一人きり means "only one person, and no one else." ばかり can mean "only" (like だけ),
      "just finished," or "always doing."
    grammar_point: 〜きり (only・just)
  - term: のみ (only・just)
    meaning: only; solely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: のみ is a more formal and literary equivalent of だけ or ばかり, often used in written language or
      very formal speech. ばかり is more common in everyday conversation and carries a wider range of nuances.
    grammar_point: のみ (only・just)
  - term: たばかり (just did)
    meaning: just did something
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While たばかり is a specific common usage of ばかり, this phrase strictly emphasizes that an action
      was completed very recently, implying freshness or newness. ばかり in other contexts can mean "only"
      or "always doing."
    grammar_point: たばかり (just did)
post_false_friends_writeup: While ばかり, だけ, しか〜ない, きり, and のみ all convey a sense of limitation or exclusivity,
  their nuances and grammatical structures differ significantly. だけ is a neutral 'only,' merely stating
  a limit. しか〜ない explicitly implies 'nothing but' and must be followed by a negative form, emphasizing
  scarcity. きり denotes an unchangeable state or an isolated 'only.' のみ is a formal variant of 'only.'
  Finally, たばかり is a specific phrase meaning 'just completed,' whereas ばかり generally denotes 'only' or
  'always doing' (with a potential nuance of excess).

    english_literally: The baby, cry only is.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 赤ちゃん は 泣き そう だ。
        english: The baby looks like it's going to cry.
        hint: 〜そうだ indicates something 'looks like' it will happen based on appearance. 泣くばかりだ implies
          the baby is 'on the verge of' crying, as if that's the only thing left to do. We're looking
          for an expression that means 'almost exclusively doing' or 'on the verge of'.
    scene: A parent or guardian observing a baby showing signs of distress.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    nuance: ばかり here implies that the baby is 'on the verge of' crying 「泣くばかりだ」, almost exclusively focused
      on that action, suggesting that crying is the imminent and dominant state.
post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, ばかり's meaning shifts depending on what it attaches to.
  With nouns or the て-form of verbs, it often implies 'only' or 'always doing' with a nuance of excess.
  When used with the past tense (た), it clearly signifies a very recent action. Its flexibility makes
  it a nuanced particle for expressing limitation, completion, or focus.
