    "etymology": "The term \"る-verb\" is a descriptive term referring to verbs that end in \"る.\" The term \"ichidan verb\" (一段動詞) literally means \"one-level verb,\" referring to the fact that the conjugation involves only one level of change (i.e., changing the \"る\" ending).",
    "writeup": "る-Verbs are verbs that have only one possible conjugation pattern. This pattern simply involves the replacement of る with another construction, depending on the tense of the verb (past, negative, etc.). This conjugation pattern that only includes る is where the Japanese name *ichidan* (一段) \"one-level\" comes from.\n\nIn these examples, we can see that る is removed from the verb to create the polite ます form. The る form of the verb is often called \"plain form\", \"casual form\", or \"short form\", depending on the source/book.\n\nAll る-Verbs end in the kana る; there are no exceptions to this rule.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nWhile all る-Verbs end in る, not all verbs that end in る are る-Verbs. These verbs can be identified by the る changing, rather than being removed when conjugated.\n\nAs the る in 取る becomes り in 取ります, we can determine immediately that it is not a る-Verb, but actually a う-Verb.",
