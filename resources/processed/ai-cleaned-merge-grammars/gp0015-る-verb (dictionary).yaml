    "etymology": "The term 「る-verb」 comes from the fact that these verbs always end in 「る」 in their dictionary form. 「Ichidan (一段)」 means 'one level,' referring to their simple conjugation pattern where the 「る」 is simply replaced.",
    "writeup": "る-verbs, also known as Ichidan verbs (一段動詞), are a class of Japanese verbs characterized by their consistent conjugation pattern. The key feature of these verbs is that they always end in 「る」 in their dictionary form (辞書形). To conjugate them, you generally replace the 「る」 with the appropriate ending.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   All verbs that end in 「る」 are **not** necessarily る-verbs. Some are う-verbs (Godan verbs), which have different conjugation rules. For example, 取る (to take) is *not* a る-verb because the 「る」 changes to 「り」 in the ます form (取ります).\n*   る-verbs are generally considered simpler to conjugate than う-verbs because of their consistent pattern.",
