    "writeup": "る-verbs, also known as Ichidan verbs (一段動詞), are a class of Japanese verbs characterized by their consistent conjugation pattern. The key feature of these verbs is that they always end in 「る」 in their dictionary form (辞書形). To conjugate them, you generally replace the 「る」 with the appropriate ending.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   All verbs that end in 「る」 are **not** necessarily る-verbs. Some are う-verbs (Godan verbs), which have different conjugation rules. For example, 取る (とる - to take) is *not* a る-verb because the 「る」 changes to 「り」 in the ます form (取ります). It's crucial to identify the correct verb type to apply the right conjugation rules.\n*   る-verbs are generally considered simpler to conjugate than う-verbs because of their consistent pattern.",
