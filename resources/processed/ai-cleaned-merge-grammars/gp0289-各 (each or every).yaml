  katakana: カク

jlpt: N4
details:
  register: formal
  usage-context: general
  nuance: Often used in formal or technical contexts to refer to individual items or entities within a
    group, emphasizing their distinctness or distribution. It implies a systematic or complete consideration
    of all members of a defined set.
etymology: 「各」 is derived from the pictographic representation of a foot approaching a place, signifying
  arrival at 'each' individual location or point.
writeup: The prefix 「各 (かく)」 is used to indicate "each," "every," or "respective." It is generally used
  before nouns, especially words of Chinese origin (kanji compounds) or katakana words. While it's not
  typically used with units of time, 「各」 is commonly used to identify items in a sequence, such as floors
  in a building or houses on a street. It has a slightly more formal and precise tone compared to synonyms
  like 「それぞれ」. When 「各」 is combined with nouns that denote a person (e.g., 「各人」, 「各自」), it refers to "each
  person" or "individually." This usage is common in instructions or formal statements where individual
  responsibility or action is emphasized. While 「各」 serves a similar function to 「各々 (おのおの)」, 「各々」 is
  predominantly used when referring to people, often with a slightly more personal nuance, whereas 「各」
  is broader in application and can refer to inanimate objects or abstract concepts as well. 「各」 is frequently
  encountered in official documents, announcements, and business communications.

  - term: 各々
    meaning: Each, respectively
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「各々 (おのおの)」 is generally used when referring to people or distinct entities, emphasizing individual
      action or responsibility. It often carries a slightly more personal or traditional nuance than 「各」,
      and can be used as a standalone noun or adverb. For example, 「皆、各々考えがある。」 (Everyone has their own
      thoughts, respectively).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:各々 (each・respective)
  - term: それぞれ
    meaning: Each, respective, severally
    kind: synonym
    nuance: 「それぞれ」 is a very common and versatile word that can mean 'each', 'respectively', or 'individually'.
      It is less formal than 「各」 and can be used with a wider range of nouns, including abstract ones,
      and often emphasizes individual differences or separate actions. For example, 「それぞれの意見を聞く。」 (Listen
      to each opinion).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:それぞれ (each・respective)
  - term: 個別
    meaning: Individual, separate
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「個別 (こべつ)」 is a noun meaning 'individual' or 'separate'. While it implies distinctness, it
      focuses on the state of being separate rather than the distribution or enumeration of each item
      within a group, as 「各」 does. For example, 「個別に質問する。」 (Ask a question individually).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:個別 (individual・separate)
post_false_friends_writeup: When distinguishing 「各」 from 「各々」, remember that 「各」 is more often a prefix
  indicating "each" within a defined group, especially with formal or Chinese-derived nouns. 「各々」, on
  the other hand, is a more standalone word, often referring to "each one" of people, emphasizing individual
  actions. For 「それぞれ」, consider its flexibility and less formal tone; it's a general term for 'each' that
  doesn't carry the same formal or systematic nuance as 「各」. Finally, 「個別」 describes things as being 'separate'
  or 'individual', focusing on their distinct state rather than their count within a set. Choosing the
  right term depends on the formality, the type of noun, and the specific emphasis desired.

          - 学生 全員 が 質問 に 答え た。
        english: All students answered the question.
        hint: The scene implies a focus on individual responses rather than a collective outcome. 「各人」
          emphasizes individual action within a group, unlike 「全員」 which implies a collective or complete
          set. We're looking for emphasis on each person's individual response.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 生徒 一人一人 が 質問 に 答え た。
        english: Each and every student answered the question.
        hint: The scene implies a straightforward, formal assessment. 「各人」 is more concise and formal
          than 「一人一人」 which emphasizes each and every one, often implying a more laborious or detailed
          individual process. We're looking for a formal term that implies each person individually.

        english: After the meeting, there were reports from respective departments.
        hint: The professional setting and the focus on distinct units suggest a more formal and structured

          'each department'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 会議 の 後 に 全て の 部門 から 報告 が あっ た。
        english: After the meeting, there were reports from all departments.
        hint: 「各部門」 highlights the individual contribution or separate nature of each department's report,

          distinctness of each report.

          - それぞれ の 分野 の 専門 家 が 集まり、議論 し た。
        english: Experts from respective fields gathered and discussed.
        hint: The context of a formal conference implies a systematic representation of distinct, recognized
          fields, making 「各分野」 a more precise and formal choice over 「それぞれ」. We're looking for a formal
          way to express 'each field'.
      - competing_japanese:
          - 多様 な 分野 の 専門 家 が 集まり、議論 し た。
        english: Experts from diverse fields gathered and discussed.
        hint: While 「多様な」 (diverse) emphasizes variety, 「各分野」 specifically highlights that every relevant
          field was represented, implying completeness rather than just variety, which fits the academic
          context of experts gathering. We're looking for a term that means 'all fields' were represented
          individually.

        english: Please cooperate with electricity saving in respective households.

      - competing_japanese:

        english: Please cooperate with electricity saving in all households.
        hint: 「各家庭」 emphasizes the individual responsibility of each household to act, which is stronger
          than a simple statement about the collective total (「全家庭」). We're looking for individual responsibility
          rather than just a total count.

          individual responsibility.

post_example_writeup: As seen in the examples, 「各」 is often used with nouns that denote a collection or
  series of items, such as 「各階 (かくかい - each floor)」, 「各家庭 (かくかてい - each household)」, or 「各科目 (かくかもく -
  each subject)」. This highlights its function in systematically referring to every member of a set. When
  used with words like 「各人 (かくじん - each person)」 or 「各自 (かくじ - each one/person)」, the emphasis shifts
  to individual responsibility or action within a group, particularly in formal instructions or statements
  of accountability. Understanding these collocations is key to mastering the precise application of 「各」.
