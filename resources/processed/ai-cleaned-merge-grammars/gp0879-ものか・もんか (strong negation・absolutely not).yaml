  jlpt: N2
  details:
    part-of-speech: phrase
    usage-context: Usually used in conversation
    function: Expresses strong negative intention or disagreement.
    nuance: Poses a strong rhetorical question implying disbelief or strong negation. Can also imply that
      the speaker cannot bear for something to eventuate.
    grammatical-role: Sentence-final rhetorical expression
  etymology: 「もの」 is a noun meaning "thing" or "matter," and 「か」 is a particle indicating a question. Together,
    they create a rhetorical question implying disbelief or strong negation, like asking "As if that's even
    a thing!" The combined usage evolved to express strong denial or impossibility.
  writeup: |-
    「ものか」 is a set expression used to strongly suggest that a statement is absolutely not going to happen or is definitely untrue. It functions as a rhetorical question that expects a negative answer, expressing the speaker's strong disagreement or disbelief. The implication is similar to saying "as if!" in English, conveying a sense of incredulity or vehement denial.

    This expression can be attached to various word types:
    *   **Verbs and い-Adjectives:** Use their plain, non-past forms.
    *   **な-Adjectives and Nouns:** Require 「な」 before 「ものか」 (e.g., 便利**な**ものか, 病気**な**ものか).

    Other variants such as 「もんか」, 「もんですか」, and 「ものですか」 are also frequently encountered. 「もんか」 is a casual, contracted form of 「ものか」. 「もんですか」 and 「ものですか」 are more polite forms, often favored by female speakers, conveying the same strong rhetorical negation with a slightly softer nuance.

    Additionally, when 「ものか」 follows the past tense (た form) of verbs, it can imply that the speaker cannot bear for the event to have occurred or to be true, often because they evaluate it as highly negative or undesirable. This usage emphasizes a strong emotional rejection of a past possibility or outcome. While 「ものか」 primarily expresses strong denial, it can also imply the speaker's shock or disbelief in relation to conditions presented in the preceding statement, such as an amount, possibility, or result.
  false_friends:
    - term: どころではない
      meaning: This is not the time for…, Far from, Out of the question
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: Unlike 「ものか」, 「どころではない」 focuses on the inappropriateness of something at a certain time or
        under certain circumstances. It suggests that something is not even a consideration.
      grammar_point: どころではない (not the time or place for)
    - term: どころか
      meaning: Far from, Anything but
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: Unlike 「ものか」, 「どころか」 implies a stronger contrast than expected. It doesn't just deny something,
        but also provides a contrasting statement.
      grammar_point: どころか (far from)
    - term: はずがない
      meaning: Hardly possible, Cannot be, Highly unlikely, Improbable
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: Unlike 「ものか」, 「はずがない」 expresses a logical conclusion that something is impossible based on
        certain reasons or expectations, while 「ものか」 expresses an emotional rejection or strong disbelief
        through a rhetorical question.
      grammar_point: はずがない (logical impossibility)
    - term: ことか
      meaning: How…, What..., God knows...
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: Unlike 「ものか」, 「ことか」 expresses a strong emotional feeling about something, often involving
        a sense of wonder or regret. It doesn't necessarily imply negation or denial.
      grammar_point: ことか (how surprising or emotional)
    - term: っこない
      meaning: There is no chance of, There is no way of, Impossible
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While 「ものか」 poses a rhetorical question to strongly deny something, 「っこない」 makes a direct
        and assertive statement of impossibility, often implying certainty based on experience or common
        sense.
      grammar_point: っこない (no chance of)
    - term: まい
      meaning: Won't, intend not to, probably not
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: 「まい」 expresses the speaker's strong negative intention or a negative prediction about an event.
        In contrast, 「ものか」 questions the possibility of something happening or being true, often with an
        indignant or disbelieving tone.
      grammar_point: まい (won't・probably not)
    - term: とても〜ない
      meaning: Cannot possibly ~; Not ~ at all
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: While 「ものか」 uses a rhetorical question to express strong disbelief or impossibility with an
        emotional or indignant tone, 「とても〜ない」 is a more direct and definitive statement of impossibility
        or utter inability, often emphasizing the extreme degree that prevents something from happening.
      grammar_point: とても〜ない (cannot possibly ~)
    - term: どうにも〜ない
      meaning: Cannot ~ by any means; no matter how hard ~ try, ~ cannot ~; there is no way to ~; cannot
        do ~ at all
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: Both 「ものか」 and 「どうにも〜ない」 express impossibility, but 「どうにも〜ない」 emphasizes that something is
        impossible despite all efforts or attempts, conveying a sense of helplessness or frustration with
        an objective impossibility, whereas 「ものか」 is a more subjective, rhetorical dismissal.
      grammar_point: どうにも〜ない (no way to ~)
    - term: ないことはない
      meaning: Is not impossible; It doesn't mean that it isn't
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: Unlike 「ものか」 which is a strong rhetorical denial of possibility, 「ないことはない」 implies a softened
        affirmation, suggesting that something is not impossible or might be true, often with hesitation
        or a nuanced concession.
      grammar_point: ないことはない (not impossible)
  post_false_friends_writeup: 「ものか」 is used for expressing a strong sense of denial or disbelief through
    a rhetorical question. It's useful to differentiate this from similar expressions like 「どころではない」 (which
    is about inappropriateness), 「どころか」 (which provides a contrasting statement), 「はずがない」 (which expresses
    logical impossibility), 「ことか」 (which conveys strong emotions), 「っこない」 (which asserts direct impossibility),
    and 「まい」 (which expresses negative intention or prediction). Additionally, while 「ものか」 strongly denies
    possibility, 「とても〜ない」 and 「どうにも〜ない」 are more direct statements of utter impossibility or inability despite
    effort. Conversely, 「ないことはない」 subtly affirms possibility, standing in contrast to the outright denial
    of 「ものか」. Pay attention to the context and the speaker's emotional stance to choose the most appropriate
    form.

            - 俺 が そんな ダサい 制服 を 着 ない {だろう}。
          english: I probably wouldn't wear such an unfashionable uniform.
          hint: This hints at a prediction, but we're looking for a strong, indignant refusal. The speaker
            is expressing utter disbelief at the idea, not just a likelihood.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 俺 が そんな ダサい 制服 を 着る {はず が ない}。
          english: I shouldn't wear such an unfashionable uniform.
          hint: This implies a logical impossibility or impropriety, but we're looking for an emotional,
            emphatic rejection of the idea. The speaker is expressing their strong personal aversion.
      scene: A high school student, known for their strong fashion sense, is told by a friend they have
        to wear a specific, unflattering uniform for a school event.
      register: casual
      setting: humorous
      conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
      speaker_gender: male
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: The speaker uses 「俺」 (male pronoun) to express a strong, almost indignant rejection. The phrase
        「ダサい制服」 (uncool uniform) highlights the personal distaste, making the rhetorical question 「着る{ものか}！」
        a natural fit for this youthful, casual male expression of defiance.
    - english: I'm so busy, as if I'm having any fun.
      japanese:
        - こんな に 忙しい の に、楽しい {もん か}。
        - こんな に 忙しい の に、楽しい {もの か}。
      english_literally: So busy, even though, fun thing question.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - こんな に 忙しい の に、楽しく {ない}。
          english: Even though I'm so busy, it's not fun.
          hint: This is a simple statement of fact, but we're looking for a rhetorical question that implies
            strong disbelief or impossibility of enjoyment. The speaker is expressing an exasperated lament.
        - competing_japanese:
            - こんな に 忙しい の に、楽しい {はず が ない}。
          english: Even though I'm so busy, it shouldn't be fun.
          hint: This implies a logical conclusion, but we're looking for a personal, emotional statement
            of obvious non-enjoyment. The speaker is expressing their deeply felt exhaustion.
      scene: A person working long hours sighs, commenting on their state.
      register: casual
      setting: melancholic
      conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
      speaker_age: older
      nuance: The contracted form 「もんか」 makes the expression more casual and reflective. The emphasis on
        「こんなに忙しいのに」 (despite being so busy) sets up the rhetorical question, implying an obvious lack of
        enjoyment. This is a common, slightly exasperated lament from an older person about their circumstances.
    - english: Running around this much every day, do you really think I can maintain my concentration?
      japanese:
        - 毎日、こんな に 走り回っ て、疲れ て ない {もの か}。
        - 毎日、こんな に 走り回っ て、疲れ て ない {もん か}。
      english_literally: Every day, this much running around, tired not thing question.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 毎日、こんな に 走り回っ て、疲れ て ない {だろう}。
          english: Running around this much every day, I probably won't be tired.
          hint: This is a prediction about tiredness, but we're looking for a rhetorical question that expresses
            exasperation and implies an obvious 'yes, I am tired'. The speaker is emphasizing the inevitability
            of their fatigue.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 毎日、こんな に 走り回っ て、疲れ て ない {はず が ない}。
          english: Running around this much every day, it's impossible that I'm not tired.
          hint: This implies a logical impossibility, but we're looking for an emotional, rhetorical challenge
            to the listener that emphasizes the speaker's strong feeling of being tired. It's an exasperated
            complaint, not just a logical deduction.
      scene: A mother of young children, juggling multiple responsibilities, expresses her exhaustion to
        a friend.
      register: casual
      setting: serious
      conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      speaker_age: older
      nuance: The repetition of 「毎日、こんなに」 emphasizes the arduous nature of her daily life. The rhetorical
        question 「疲れてない{ものか}」 (am I not tired?) is a common way for women, especially mothers, to express
        their exhaustion to understanding friends without directly complaining, implying an obvious 'Of
        course I am tired!'
    - english: Someone who betrays you like that is absolutely not a friend!
      japanese:
        - 裏切る よう な やつ は 友達 な {もの か}！
        - 裏切る よう な やつ は 友達 な {もん か}！
      english_literally: Betraying like person friend thing question!
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 裏切る よう な やつ は 友達 {じゃ ない}。
          english: Someone who betrays you like that is not a friend.
          hint: This is a simple statement of fact, but we're looking for a strong, emotional, and accusatory
            denial, conveying outrage. The speaker is expressing profound disbelief that such a person could
            be considered a friend.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 裏切る よう な やつ は 友達 な {はず が ない}。
          english: Someone who betrays you like that shouldn't be a friend.
          hint: This implies a logical impossibility, but we're looking for a dramatic declaration born
            of anger, where the speaker is emphatically questioning the very concept of friendship in this
            context. It's an emotional rejection, not a logical deduction.
      scene: Someone has just learned their friend betrayed them and is expressing their anger to another
        confidant.
      register: casual
      setting: serious
      conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
      speaker_gender: male
      listener_gender: male
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: The phrase 「裏切るようなやつ」 (a guy who betrays you) sets a strong negative context. The use of 「{ものか}」
        here is a forceful rhetorical question, implying an absolute 'no' to the idea of such a person being
        a friend. This intense emotional reaction is typical in heated discussions between younger male
        friends.
    - english: As if I could have analyzed this huge amount of data by myself.
      japanese:
        - 一人 で この 膨大 な データ を 分析 でき た {もん か}。
        - 一人 で この 膨大 な データ を 分析 でき た {もの か}。
      english_literally: Alone this huge data analyze could thing question.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 一人 で この 膨大 な データ を 分析 でき なかっ た {だろう}。
          english: I probably couldn't have analyzed this huge amount of data by myself.
          hint: This implies a prediction about inability, but we're looking for a strong, rhetorical statement
            that emphasizes the utter impossibility and frustration. The speaker is expressing deep personal
            feeling of being overwhelmed.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 一人 で この 膨大 な データ を 分析 できる {はず が ない}。
          english: It's impossible to analyze this huge amount of data by myself.
          hint: This implies a logical impossibility, but we're looking for a personal lament about the
            unreasonable nature of the task. The speaker is conveying a frustrated, emotional assessment.
      scene: A researcher laments the impossibility of completing a massive data analysis task alone.
      register: casual
      setting: pessimistic
      conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
      speaker_age: older
      nuance: The phrase 「膨大なデータ」 (huge amount of data) emphasizes the scale of the task. 「できた{もんか}」 (could
        I have done it?) strongly implies "no, I couldn't have." An older researcher might use this casual,
        contracted form when expressing futility or the unreasonable nature of a task to a colleague.
    - english: As if I could have eaten such salty food.
      japanese:
        - こんな に 塩辛い 料理、食べ られ た {もん か}。
        - こんな に 塩辛い 料理、食べ られ た {もの か}。
      english_literally: This much salty food, eaten could thing question.
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - こんな に 塩辛い 料理、食べ られ {なかっ た}。
          english: I couldn't eat such salty food.
          hint: This is a simple statement of inability, but we're looking for a strong, almost disgusted,
            rhetorical question about the possibility of consumption. The speaker is expressing a powerful
            emotional reaction.
        - competing_japanese:
            - こんな に 塩辛い 料理、食べ られる {はず が ない}。
          english: It's impossible to eat such salty food.
          hint: This implies a logical impossibility, but we're looking for a visceral rejection of the
            food. The speaker is expressing a passionate, rather than objective, statement of disgust.
      scene: Someone has tried a dish that is extremely salty and expresses their disgust.
      register: casual
      setting: humorous
      conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: 「こんなに塩辛い料理」 (such salty food) sets the stage for the strong negative reaction. The past potential
        form 「食べられた{もんか}」 effectively conveys "there's no way I *could have* eaten it" due to its unpalatability.
        This kind of exaggerated complaint is common in casual, humorous settings among younger people.
    - english: No! There's no way I'm marrying that person!
      japanese:
        - 違う よ！あの 人 と 結婚 する {もの か}！
        - 違う よ！あの 人 と 結婚 する {もん か}！
      english_literally: Different! That person marry thing question!
      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 違う よ！あの 人 と 結婚 し {ない}！
          english: No! I won't marry that person!
          hint: This is a direct negation, but we're looking for a vehement, almost indignant denial, as
            if to say, 'How could you even suggest such a thing?' The speaker is expressing strong personal
            repulsion.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 違う よ！あの 人 と 結婚 する {はず が ない}！
          english: No! I shouldn't marry that person!
          hint: This implies a logical impossibility or impropriety, but we're looking for an emotional
            rejection of the idea. The speaker is expressing their visceral objection, not just a logical
            one.
      scene: A woman vehemently denies a rumor about her impending marriage to someone she dislikes.
      register: casual
      setting: serious
      conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: 「違うよ！」 is a direct and forceful denial. The subsequent 「あの人と結婚する{ものか}！」 emphasizes the speaker's
        strong, personal repulsion towards the idea of marrying "that person." This kind of strong, almost
        indignant denial is characteristic of younger female speech when rejecting unwanted rumors.
    - english: You, who don't know hardship, as if you'd understand these feelings!
      japanese:
        - 苦労 を 知ら ない 君 に、この 気持ち が わかる {もん か}。
        - 苦労 を 知ら ない 君 に、この 気持ち が わかる {もの か}。

      competing_grammar:
        - competing_japanese:
            - 苦労 を 知ら ない 君 に、この 気持ち が わから {ない}。
          english: You, who don't know hardship, won't understand these feelings.
          hint: This is a simple statement of fact, but we're looking for a strong, emotional, and rhetorical
            dismissal of the listener's capacity for empathy. The speaker is expressing frustration and
            implied criticism.
        - competing_japanese:
            - 苦労 を 知ら ない 君 に、この 気持ち が わかる {はず が ない}。
          english: You, who don't know hardship, shouldn't understand these feelings.
          hint: This implies a logical impossibility, but we're looking for an emotional outburst of frustration
            and dismissal. The speaker is conveying a personal, rather than purely logical, judgment.
      scene: A person who has gone through significant difficulties expresses frustration to a naive friend
        about their lack of empathy.
      register: casual
      setting: melancholic
      conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
      speaker_gender: female
      listener_gender: female
      speaker_age: younger
      nuance: 「苦労を知らない君に」 (to you, who doesn't know hardship) sets up the reason for the rhetorical question.
        The phrase 「わかる{もんか}」 (as if you'd understand) conveys a powerful emotional dismissal of the listener's
        capacity for empathy, typical in raw, honest conversations between younger female friends.
    - english: That serious person would absolutely not tell such a lie. He's not that kind of person.
      japanese:
        - あの 真面目 な 彼 が そんな 嘘 を つく {もの か}。そう いう 人 じゃ ない。
        - あの 真面目 な 彼 が そんな 嘘 を つく {もん か}。そう いう 人 じゃ ない。

          english: That serious person wouldn't tell such a lie. He's not that kind of person.
          hint: This is a simple statement of non-action, but we're looking for a strong, firm assertion
            of character that emphatically denies the possibility. The speaker is expressing deep personal
            conviction.
        - competing_japanese:
            - あの 真面目 な 彼 が そんな 嘘 を つく {はず が ない}。そう いう 人 {じゃ ない}。
          english: It's impossible for that serious person to tell such a lie. He's not that kind of person.
          hint: This implies a logical impossibility, but we're looking for an emphatic personal conviction
            about someone's character. The speaker is asserting their understanding of the person, not just
            a logical deduction.
      scene: A colleague defends another colleague's integrity against a false accusation.
      register: semi-formal
      setting: serious
      conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
      speaker_age: older
      nuance: 「あの真面目な彼が」 (that serious/diligent him) establishes the person's character, reinforcing the
        speaker's conviction. 「そんな嘘をつく{ものか}」 is a strong, rhetorical denial, asserting that telling such
        a lie is completely out of character for him. This kind of confident defense is often heard from
        older colleagues or superiors.
    - english: If we start now, as if we'll make it by the deadline.
      japanese:

  details:
    part-of-speech: phrase
    register: semi-formal
    nuance: Used to express a strong desire or a rhetorical question implying a wish for something to happen,
      often when it seems difficult or unlikely. It can also convey a sense of uncertainty or deliberation
      about the best course of action. The inclusion of 「だろうか」 softens the tone, making it more of a pondering
      or a gentle inquiry rather than a direct challenge or forceful wish.
    grammatical-role: Acts as a rhetorical question or a deliberative clause, often functioning adverbially
      within a larger sentence.
    temporal-flow: Used across various temporal contexts, depending on the verb it modifies.
    spatial-flow: No inherent spatial flow. Usage is context-dependent.
  etymology: The phrase 「ものか」 is derived from 「もの」, which originally signified a thing or matter, combined
    with 「か」, a question particle. Over time, it evolved to express not just a simple question, but also
    a deeper sense of desire, doubt, or a rhetorical challenge to the status quo. The addition of 「だろう」
    further emphasizes the speculative or wondering aspect.
  writeup: |-
    The grammar point 「ものか」 serves two primary functions in Japanese. Firstly, it expresses a strong wish or desire for something to happen, particularly when that something is difficult or seems unlikely. In this usage, it often attaches to the potential negative form of a verb, posing a rhetorical question that implies, "Wouldn't it be great if...?" or "I wish it could be..." This form can also convey a sense of frustration or yearning.

    Secondly, 「ものか」 is used when the speaker is pondering, wondering, or deliberating about what action they should take, especially when faced with a choice or uncertainty. In this context, it typically follows a question word (such as 「どう」, 「どこ」, 「何」) and a verb in its informal past form, often followed by a verb of thinking like 「思う」 (omou), 「考える」 (kangaeru), 「迷う」 (mayou - to be at a loss), or 「思案する」 (shian suru - to ponder). This construction translates to "I wonder what/how I should..." or "I'm thinking of whether I should..."

    The optional addition of 「だろうか」 (darou ka) to 「ものか」 softens the expression. While 「ものか」 on its own can sometimes sound quite direct or even rhetorical, adding 「だろうか」 transforms it into a more gentle pondering or a milder wish, making it less assertive and more reflective. This subtle shift allows for a wider range of emotional expression, from mild contemplation to deep yearning.
  false_friends:
    - term: ことか
      meaning: How...! / How much...!
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: Unlike 「ものか」, 「ことか」 expresses strong emotion or emphasis on the degree or extent of something.
        It is an exclamation, not a wish or a pondering. For example, 「何度注意したことか！」 (How many times have
        I warned you!).
      grammar_point: ことか (how surprising or emotional)
    - term: べきか
      meaning: Should I...?
      kind: often confused with
      nuance: While both express consideration, 「べきか」 asks about moral or logical necessity or obligation,
        whereas 「ものか」 often expresses a wish, explores possibilities, or ponders what one *should* do from
        a deliberative standpoint, not a duty. For instance, 「行くべきか」 means 'Should I go (because it's the
        right thing/expected)?' whereas 「行ったものか」 means 'I wonder if I should go (considering the options)?'.
      grammar_point: べき (should)
    - term: たらいい・といい
      meaning: I wish (it would happen); I wonder if (it would be good)
      kind: similar expression
      nuance: This construction expresses a simpler, more direct wish or suggestion for something to happen,
        or a wondering about whether something would be good. While similar to the 'wish' usage of 「ものか」,
        「ものか」 often carries a stronger, more rhetorical, or wistful tone, especially when used with the
        potential negative form. For example, 「雨が降ったらいいのに」 (I wish it would rain) is a direct wish, whereas
        「雨が降らないものだろうか」 (I wonder if it won't rain / I wish it would rain) implies a deeper yearning or a
        rhetorical query about the possibility.
      grammar_point: たらいい・といい (hope・suggestion)
  post_false_friends_writeup: While 「ことか」, 「べきか」, and 「～たらいいのに/だが/か」 might appear similar, they convey distinct
    nuances. 「ことか」 is an exclamation of intensity, 「べきか」 is about obligation or strong recommendation, and
    「～たらいいのに/だが/か」 expresses a simpler wish or suggestion. 「ものか」, on the other hand, delves into deeper
    yearning, rhetorical questioning, or a thorough deliberation about one's actions, making it more introspective
    or subtly demanding than its false friends. Understanding these differences is crucial for precise communication.

        change in living situation, rather than a direct lament. The casual setting between roommates naturally
        accommodates this introspective expression. The use of 「狭すぎる」 (too small) implies the current unsatisfactory
        state.

    「だろうか」 to grasp the full meaning.
