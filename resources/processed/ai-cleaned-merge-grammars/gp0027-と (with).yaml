jlpt: N5
etymology: The particle 「と」 (to) has roots in the classical Japanese particle 「と言ふ」 (to iu), meaning "to
  say" or "to be called." This origin explains its use in direct quotations. Over time, its function expanded
  to express association and conjunction, likely through a semantic extension from connecting speech or
  thoughts to connecting entities or actions. The meaning of "with" or "and" (in the sense of accompaniment)
  developed from this core idea of emergence or derivation.
writeup: "The particle 「と」 (to) is a fundamental particle in Japanese that primarily signifies accompaniment\
  \ or mutual action. While often translated as \"with\" in English, its core function is to establish\
  \ a clear relationship between two or more nouns, emphasizing their equal involvement or shared activity.\
  \ It is used with verbs that inherently suggest interaction or collaboration.\n\nWhen indicating **accompaniment\
  \ or mutual action**, 「と」 highlights that all connected parties are actively participating in the same\
  \ action or state. This is evident with verbs that naturally imply shared activity, such as: 「話す」 (hanasu,\
  \ to talk), 「食べる」 (taberu, to eat), 「遊ぶ」 (asobu, to play), 「結婚する」 (kekkon suru, to marry), 「喧嘩する」 (kenka\
  \ suru, to quarrel), 「話し合う」 (hanashiau, to discuss). In these contexts, 「と」 signifies a two-way or reciprocal\
  \ engagement. For example, 「友達 と 話す」 (tomodachi to hanasu) implies a conversation where both individuals\
  \ are speaking and listening.\n\nIt is imperative to understand the crucial distinction between 「と」\
  \ and the particle 「に」 (ni). While both can appear in contexts involving interaction, their nuances\
  \ are fundamentally different:\n\n*   **「と」:** Conveys mutual involvement, cooperation, or reciprocal\
  \ action. The action is shared by all parties.\n*   **「に」:** Typically marks the target or recipient\
  \ of a one-sided action. The action is directed *towards* something or someone, without necessarily\
  \ implying their active participation in the same way as 「と」. \n\nConsider the difference: 「先生 と 話す」\
  \ (sensei to hanasu) implies a mutual discussion *with* the teacher. Conversely, 「先生 に 話す」 (sensei ni\
  \ hanasu) means to talk *to* the teacher, suggesting a one-sided communication where the speaker is\
  \ conveying information *to* the teacher. Mastering this distinction is crucial for natural and precise\
  \ expression in Japanese."

    grammar_point: '[Verb-stem]に行く (to go in order to do)'
post_false_friends_writeup: 'To fully grasp the usage of 「と」 for accompaniment, it''s vital to differentiate
  it from other instances of 「と」 and from the particle 「に」. While 「と」 can mark quotations or inevitable
  consequences, its core meaning of "with" always implies a shared or mutual involvement. This is where
  the distinction from 「に」 becomes crucial: 「に」 points to a *target* or *recipient* of an action, implying
  a one-sided direction, while 「と」 emphasizes an action done *together* or *in conjunction* with someone
  or something.'
