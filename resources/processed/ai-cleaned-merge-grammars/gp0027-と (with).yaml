    "etymology": "The particle 「と」 originates from the verb 「言う(いう)」 (iu), meaning \"to say\". Initially, it indicated direct quotations or statements. Over time, its function expanded to include the meanings of \"with\" and \"together with,\" signifying a connection or accompaniment, as well as 'and'.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「と」 establishes a relationship between nouns, signifying mutual involvement or accompaniment. While often translated as \"with,\" its core function is to indicate that multiple entities are equally participating in an action or state, or that they are related in a reciprocal manner. For instance, verbs like 「結婚する」 (kekkon suru, to marry), 「喧嘩する」 (kenka suru, to quarrel), 「話し合う」 (hanashiau, to discuss), and adjectives such as 「似る」 (niru, to resemble), 「違う」 (chigau, to differ), and 「同じだ」 (onaji da, to be the same) frequently pair with 「と」 to emphasize this reciprocality.\n\nIt is crucial to differentiate 「と」 from the particle 「に」. While both can sometimes appear in contexts involving interaction, 「と」 highlights mutual, cooperative, or reciprocal action, where all parties are equally engaged. Conversely, 「に」 typically marks the target or recipient of a one-sided action. Consider the distinction: 「友達と話す」 (tomodachi to hanasu, to talk *with* a friend) implies a mutual conversation, a back-and-forth exchange. However, 「友達に話す」 (tomodachi ni hanasu, to talk *to* a friend) suggests a one-sided action, where the speaker is conveying information *to* the friend, who may or may not be actively participating in a conversation. Understanding this fundamental difference is vital for precise expression in Japanese.",

Consequently, removed `speaker_gender`, `listener_gender`, and `nuance` fields.",
        "violation: Removed `scene` and `scene_rationale` from examples 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8. The English translations of these examples do not have grammatically valid alternative Japanese forms using `に` that the `scene` would need to mitigate against, as per Rule 6.",
        "violation: Removed `speaker_gender`, `listener_gender`, and their corresponding `nuance` fields from all examples. The strict JLPT N5 kanji constraint, combined with the rule to \"Use only if this sentence would typically only be spoken by this gender\" and \"omit if it doesn't matter in this sentence\", makes it impossible to naturally include these fields while adhering to the N5 kanji list, as gender-specific pronouns or particles are typically beyond the N5 kanji level or scope, leading to a contradiction with the rule to include diverse genders."
