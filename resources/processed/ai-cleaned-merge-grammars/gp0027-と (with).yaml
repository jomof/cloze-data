    "etymology": "The particle 「と」 originates from the verb 「言う(いう)」 (iu), meaning \"to say\". Initially, it indicated direct quotations or statements. Over time, its function expanded to include the meanings of \"with\" and \"together with,\" signifying a connection or accompaniment, as well as 'and'.",
    "writeup": "The particle 「と」 indicates a relationship between two nouns. It can mean \"with,\" indicating that two people or things are together in an action or state. It emphasizes that both are equally involved. Be careful not to confuse 「と」 with 「に」. 「に」 highlights that one person is the *target* of an action.",
