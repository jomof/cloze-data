    "etymology": "The term 「いよいよ」 is derived from 「今 (い-ま)」 meaning \"now,\" compounded with 「弥 (いよ-いよ)」, an intensifying prefix.",
    "writeup": "「いよいよ」, typically written in hiragana, is an adverb indicating that something has or will **finally happen**. This often occurs after a prolonged or increasingly intense state. Like many sentence-modifying adverbs, 「いよいよ」 usually appears at the beginning of a phrase.\n\nIt is also used to express something that is **more and more**. The context will usually make it clear whether 「いよいよ」 means \"finally\" or \"more and more,\" depending on whether the following statement is conclusive or ongoing.",
