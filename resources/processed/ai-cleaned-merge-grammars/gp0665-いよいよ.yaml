        "function": "This adverb indicates two primary functions: 1) the final arrival or culmination of an anticipated event, or 2) the increasing intensity of a state or condition.",
        "nuance": "For events, it implies a natural progression or building anticipation leading to the moment. For conditions, it suggests a cumulative process reaching a significant degree. It often carries a sense of heightened emotion or excitement, especially for long-awaited occurrences."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「いよいよ」 is derived from 「今 (い-ま)」 meaning \"now,\" compounded with 「弥 (いよ-いよ)」, an intensifying prefix.",
    "writeup": "「いよいよ」, typically written in hiragana, is an adverb used to express two primary ideas. Firstly, it signifies that something has or will **finally happen**, often after a period of anticipation, preparation, or ongoing development. This usage implies a sense of culmination, as if a process has naturally led to this decisive moment. For example, it can express the excitement or gravity of an event that has been eagerly awaited.\n\nSecondly, 「いよいよ」 can convey the idea of something becoming **more and more** or increasingly intense. In this context, it highlights a state or condition that is progressing in severity or degree, often reaching a significant point. The specific nuance, whether \"finally\" or \"more and more,\" is usually clear from the context of the sentence that follows.\n\nLike many adverbs that modify the entire sentence, 「いよいよ」 most commonly appears at the beginning of a phrase.",

    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While 「いよいよ」, 「一方だ」, 「とうとう」, and 「遂に」 can all express the idea of something happening \"finally\" or progressing \"more and more,\" they differ in nuance. 「一方だ」 focuses on continuous progression, 「とうとう」 suggests an inevitable result, and 「遂に」 highlights a sense of accomplishment, while 「いよいよ」 can express both finality and increasing intensity depending on the context.",
