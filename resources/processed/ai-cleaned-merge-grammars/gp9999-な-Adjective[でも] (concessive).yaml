id: gp9999
meaning: even if/though (na-adjective is)...; no matter how (na-adjective)...
pronunciation:
  katakana: デモ
  romaji: demo
formation:
  な-Adjective + でも: Indicates concession, 'even if/though the na-adjective is...'
  な-Adjective + じゃなくても: Indicates concession in the negative, 'even if/though the na-adjective is not...'
jlpt: N3
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  register: casual
  usage-context: Used when the state described by the na-adjective exists, but it does not prevent the
    action or state in the subsequent clause. Often implies an unexpected result.
  function: Expresses a concession or a condition that does not prevent the outcome.
  nuance: Implies that despite the state of the na-adjective, the subsequent action or state is not hindered
    or changed. Can convey 'no matter how [na-adjective]' or 'even though it's [na-adjective]'.
etymology: The term 「でも」 is a combination of 「で」, which is the conjunctive form (連用形) of the copula 「だ」
  (da, meaning 'is' or 'be'), and the particle 「も」 (mo), which signifies 'even' or 'also'. Therefore,
  「でも」 literally translates to 'even being...' or 'even if it is...'. This linguistic structure allows
  it to logically connect a preceding condition with a subsequent clause, emphasizing that the latter
  occurs regardless of the former.
writeup: |-
  な-Adjective[でも] is a grammatical construction used to express a concessive meaning, similar to "even if" or "even though" in English, when modifying a な-adjective. It indicates that despite the state or quality described by the な-adjective, the action or state in the main clause occurs or remains true. This pattern is formed by directly attaching でも to the な-adjective stem. For example, 暇 (hima na - free/bored) becomes 暇でも (himademo - even if/though bored).

  The core of this expression is the particle 「も」 (mo), which adds the nuance of "even" or "also". When combined with 「で」, the conjunctive form of the copula 「だ」, it forms "even if it is [な-adjective]". This construction allows you to express a situation where a certain condition (described by the な-adjective) is present, but it does not prevent the outcome or action in the subsequent clause.

  It can also convey the idea of "no matter how [な-adjective]". For instance, if you say 「どんなに大変でも、頑張ります」 (Donnani taihen demo, ganbarimasu.), it means "No matter how difficult it is, I will do my best." Here, 大変 (taihen na - difficult/tough) is a な-adjective.

  While な-Adjective[でも] is grammatically versatile, its usage generally leans towards situations where the speaker wants to emphasize that the consequence is independent of the adjective's state, often implying resilience or an unexpected continuation. It is commonly used in both casual and slightly formal contexts, depending on the overall sentence structure and the politeness level of the verb ending.
false_friends:
  - term: Verb[て]ても・い-Adjective[くても]
    meaning: even if/though (general concessive)
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: While な-Adjective[でも] directly uses でも after the な-adjective stem, Verb[て]ても and い-Adjective[くても]
      apply to verbs and い-adjectives respectively, using their て-form followed by も. They share the same
      core concessive meaning but apply to different word types. な-Adjective[でも] is specific to な-adjectives.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:concessive (～ても)
  - term: な-Adjective[だって]
    meaning: because (casual reason); even (casual emphasis)
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: な-Adjective[だって] can mean "because [na-adjective]" in very casual speech, or "even [na-adjective]"
      when emphasizing. However, its primary meaning is often as a casual replacement for 「だそうだ」 (I heard
      that). Its concessive use is less direct and often implies a reason or a listing rather than a clear
      "even if/though" condition like な-Adjective[でも]. な-Adjective[でも] explicitly sets up a conditional
      contrast.
    grammar_point: だって (even・too)
  - term: な-Adjective + だが・けれど
    meaning: but; however
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: These simply state a contrast or contradiction between two clauses. They don't carry the "even
      if" nuance of concession. For example, 「綺麗だが、高い」 (Kirei daga, takai - It's pretty, but expensive)
      vs. 「綺麗でも、買わない」 (Kirei demo, kawanai - Even if it's pretty, I won't buy it). The latter implies
      an unexpected outcome despite the prettiness.
    grammar_point: しかし・だが・けれど・しかしながら (but・however)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the nuances between な-Adjective[でも] and similar expressions
  is key to using them correctly. While forms like Verb[て]ても or い-Adjective[くても] express general concession
  across different word types, な-Adjective[でも] specifically targets な-adjectives, making it a precise
  choice for such contexts. 「だって」, while sometimes conveying emphasis, doesn't carry the strong "even
  if" conditional meaning that 「でも」 does. Similarly, simple contrastive conjunctions like 「だが」 or 「けれど」
  merely state a contradiction without the added sense of an unexpected outcome despite the initial condition.
  Pay attention to the specific type of word being modified and the exact nature of the relationship between
  the clauses.

    japanese:
      - これ、{簡単 で も}、美味しい です。

          looking for a concession rather than a direct contrast.

  indicate that an action or state occurs regardless of the condition described by the na-adjective. It
  allows for a nuanced expression of concession, highlighting that the initial condition does not hinder
  the subsequent outcome. Pay close attention to the context and the overall tone of the sentence to fully
  grasp its implication.
