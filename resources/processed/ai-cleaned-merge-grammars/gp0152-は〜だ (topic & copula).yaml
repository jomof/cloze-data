pronunciation:
  katakana: ワ ダ
  romaji: wa da
  pronunciation_warning: The particle は is pronounced 'wa', not 'ha', when used as a topic marker.
formation:
  '[Topic] + は + [Information/Description] + だ/です': Basic sentence structure indicating the topic and
    providing information about it subjected to the copula's conjugation as needed
jlpt: N5
details:
  part-of-speech: phrase
  function: Topic marker and declarative ending.
  colocation: Often found with nouns, na-adjectives, or noun phrases.
  grammatical-role: Functions as the main declarative sentence structure, forming simple statements.
  temporal-flow: Can express present, past, or future states/facts based on the copula's conjugation.
  spatial-flow: Can describe the location or presence of the topic, e.g., '学校は駅の近くです' (The school is near
    the station). Most commonly expresses states/facts.
etymology: 「は」 is a topic marker particle, originating from the hiragana form of the kanji 「波」, meaning
  'wave,' initially used to indicate contrast. 「だ」 is a copula derived from the classical Japanese auxiliary
  verb 「なり」, which evolved to indicate assertion or declaration.
writeup: "The grammar point 「は〜だ」 is a fundamental sentence structure in Japanese used to **identify the\
  \ topic** of a sentence and then provide information or a description about that topic. \n\nThe particle\
  \ 「は」 marks the topic, while 「だ」 (casual) or 「です」 (polite) acts as a copula, connecting the topic to\
  \ the information being presented. \n\nKey points:\n*   「は」 is pronounced as 「わ」 when used as a topic\
  \ marker.\n*   「だ」 is considered casual speech, while 「です」 is polite. Using 「です」 shows respect to the\
  \ listener.\n*   The structure can be used with nouns, adjectives, and verbs in certain forms.\n*  \
  \ Negative forms such as 「ではない」 and 「ではありません」 are used to negate the information being presented about\
  \ the topic. You can also use 「じゃない」 as a more colloquial negative form, although 「ではない」 is more grammatically\
  \ correct.\n\nThis structure is foundational for building declarative sentences in Japanese, allowing\
  \ the speaker to assert facts, describe entities, or state conditions."
false_friends:
  - term: ある
    meaning: To be, There is
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「は〜だ」, 「ある」 indicates the existence of something. For example, 「本がある」 means 'there
      is a book'. It focuses on existence, not defining the topic.
    grammar_point: ある (to exist, inanimate・to have)
  - term: です
    meaning: To be, Is
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「です」 is the polite form of 「だ」, it's only part of the larger 「は〜だ」 structure. 「です」 alone
      does not introduce a topic. For example, 「そうです」 means 'that's right' and doesn't use 「は」 because
      it's a statement about something previously mentioned, not a new topic introduction.
    grammar_point: です (polite copula)
  - term: が
    meaning: Subject marker
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「は」 introduces the general topic of the sentence, 「が」 marks the grammatical subject,
      often highlighting new information or emphasizing the subject in contrast to other elements. For
      example, 「私 は 学生です」 (I am a student - general statement) versus 「私 が 学生です」 (It is I who is the student
      - emphasis on 'I').
    grammar_point: が (subject marker)
  - term: らしい
    meaning: Appears to be; seems; I hear that
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike the definitive statement of 「は〜だ」, 「らしい」 indicates that something appears to be true
      based on external information, observation, or hearsay, rather than a direct assertion by the speaker.
      For instance, 「彼は日本人だ」 (He is Japanese) is a direct statement, while 「彼は日本人らしい」 (He seems to be
      Japanese/I hear he is Japanese) is an inference.
    grammar_point: '[Sentence]らしい (it seems, based on evidence・I hear)'
  - term: そうだ
    meaning: Looks like; seems like
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「そうだ」 (looks like) expresses an appearance or impression based on direct observation, while
      「は〜だ」 states a fact. For example, 「雨だ」 means 'It is rain' (a fact), while 「雨そうだ」 means 'It looks
      like rain' (an observation based on appearance).
    grammar_point: '[Adj・V-stem]そうだ (it looks・seems like)'
post_false_friends_writeup: When constructing sentences, carefully consider whether you're introducing
  a topic requiring the 「は〜だ」 structure, or simply stating the existence of something or offering a polite
  assertion. The choice between 「は」 and 「が」 is crucial for conveying emphasis. Furthermore, distinguish
  between direct statements of fact using 「は〜だ」 and expressions of appearance or inference like 「らしい」
  or 「そうだ」, as they convey different levels of certainty and source of information. Misusing these can
  lead to unnatural-sounding Japanese.
examples:
  - english: This is my book.
    japanese:
      - これ {は} 私 の 本 {だ}。
      - これ {は} 僕 の 本 {だ}。
      - これ {は} 俺 の 本 {だ}。
    english_literally: This, as for topic, my book is.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - これ {が} 私 の 本 だ。
        english: This is *my* book (among others).
        hint: 「が」 emphasizes the subject as new information or one among many, often implying a contrast.
          「は」 marks the topic for general discussion. We are looking for a general statement about the
          topic.
    scene: A young child pointing to a book they want to show their parent.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: dictionary (plain non-past)
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: 'The use of 「だ」 makes this sentence casual, appropriate for a child speaking to a parent.
      The simple statement identifies the topic ''this'' as ''my book''. The variants use different first-person
      pronouns: 「僕」 (boku) is a generally polite male pronoun, while 「俺」 (ore) is a very casual, masculine
      pronoun.'
    etymology: 「僕」 (boku) historically referred to a servant or male retainer, which evolved into a humble
      or familiar first-person pronoun. 「俺」 (ore) has roots in older, rougher speech patterns, signifying
      a strong, informal male identity. These pronouns illustrate how social nuances are embedded in word
      choice in Japanese.
  - english: Today is sunny.
    japanese:
      - 今日 {は} 晴れ {です}。
      - 今日 {は} 良い 天気 {です}。
      - 本日 {は} 晴天 {です}。
    english_literally: Today, as for topic, sunny is.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 今日 {が} 晴れ です。
        english: It is *today* that is sunny.
        hint: 「が」 specifies the subject when it is contrasted or singled out. 「は」 marks the general topic
          of discussion. We are looking for a general observation.
    scene: You are making a polite observation about the weather to a colleague at work.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    nuance: The use of 「です」 in this declarative sentence expresses politeness, which is appropriate when
      making an observation to a colleague in a professional setting. 「良い天気です」 (yoi tenki desu) provides
      a more general, slightly warmer alternative to simply 'sunny'. 「本日は晴天です」 (honjitsu wa seiten desu)
      uses more formal vocabulary, fitting for a more business-like or official context.
    etymology: 「本日」 (honjitsu) literally means 'this day', and is a more formal counterpart to the common
      「今日」 (kyō). Similarly, 「晴天」 (seiten) means 'clear sky' or 'fine weather' and is a more formal noun
      than the simpler 「晴れ」 (hare).
  - english: Yesterday was rainy.
    japanese:
      - 昨日 {は} 雨 {だっ た}。
      - 昨日 {は} 雨 {だっ た} ね。
      - 昨日 {は} 結構 雨 {だっ た} よ。
    english_literally: Yesterday, as for topic, rainy was.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 昨日 雨 {が} 降っ た。
        english: It rained yesterday.
        hint: 「雨が降る」 means 'it rains' or 'rain falls', focusing on the action. 「雨だった」 simply states 'it
          was rain' or 'it was rainy', focusing on the state. We are looking for a statement about the
          state, not the action.
    scene: You are casually chatting with a friend about the weather yesterday.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past plain (～た)
    nuance: The casual copula 「だった」 is used here, reflecting the informal and friendly nature of the conversation
      between friends about a past event. Adding 「ね」 (ne) seeks agreement or confirmation from the listener,
      while 「よ」 (yo) emphasizes the statement or provides new information with a casual assertion. 「結構」
      (kekkō) means 'quite' or 'rather', intensifying the description of the rain.
    etymology: The particle 「ね」 (ne) has roots in the classical particle 「なむ」 (namu), used to convey emphasis
      or a mild imperative, evolving to its current role in seeking agreement. 「よ」 (yo) comes from the
      classical particle 「ぞ」 (zo), which also emphasized assertions, later softening into a particle indicating
      new information or strong assertion.
  - english: This cake was really delicious, wasn't it?
    japanese:
      - この ケーキ {は} 本当 に 美味しかっ た {です}。
      - この ケーキ {は} とても 美味しかっ た {です}。
      - この ケーキ {は} 実 に 美味しかっ た {です} わ。
    english_literally: This cake, as for topic, really delicious was.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この ケーキ {が} 本当 に 美味しかっ た です。
        english: It was *this* cake that was really delicious.
        hint: 「が」 highlights the subject, often used when contrasting or introducing new information.
          「は」 sets the general topic. We are looking for a general statement about the topic.
    scene: You are politely complimenting the host of a party on their cake.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: friendly
    conjugation: past polite (～ました)
    nuance: Appending 「です」 to the past tense i-adjective 「美味しかった」 makes the compliment polite and suitable
      for expressing gratitude or appreciation to a host in a friendly setting. 「とても」 (totemo) is a very
      common adverb for 'very' and can be used interchangeably with 「本当に」 (hontō ni) in many contexts.
      Adding 「わ」 (wa) at the end of the sentence, especially after 「です」, gives a softer, often feminine
      nuance, making the compliment sound more gentle and refined.
    etymology: The sentence-final particle 「わ」 (wa), typically used by women, originated from an exclamatory
      particle 「ば」 (ba) in Old Japanese, evolving to add emphasis or emotion, and later became a marker
      of refined feminine speech.
  - english: I am not a student.
    japanese:
      - 私 {は} 学生 {で は ない}。
      - 俺 {は} 学生 {で は ない}。
      - 学生 {で は ない}。
      - 私 {は} 学生 {じゃ ない}。
    english_literally: I, as for topic, student is not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 は 学生 {じゃ なかっ た}。
        english: I was not a student.
        hint: 「じゃなかった」 is the casual past negative. We are looking for the plain present negative.
    scene: Someone mistakenly assumes you are a student, and you are correcting them in a neutral, casual
      tone.
    register: casual
    setting: informative
    conjugation: negative plain (～ない)
    nuance: The negative copula 「ではない」 is a direct and plain way to state a fact, common in casual yet
      informative contexts where a neutral correction is being made. Using 「俺は」 (ore wa) instead of 「私は」
      (watashi wa) conveys a more masculine and assertive tone. Omitting the topic 「私は」 is common when
      the context makes it clear, creating a more concise statement. 「じゃない」 (janai) is a more colloquial
      and very common contraction of 「ではない」, reflecting a more informal speech pattern.
    etymology: The contraction 「じゃない」 (janai) evolved from 「ではない」 (de wa nai) through a natural process
      of phonetic reduction, where the 'de wa' sound often reduces to 'ja'. This is a common linguistic
      phenomenon in Japanese where frequently used sequences become condensed over time, reflecting a
      tendency towards ease of articulation in casual speech.
  - english: That person is not a doctor.
    japanese:
      - あの 人 {は} 医者 {で は あり ませ ん}。
      - あの 方 {は} 医者 {で は あり ませ ん}。
      - その 方 {は} 医者 {で は あり ませ ん}。
      - 医者 {で は あり ませ ん}。
    english_literally: That person, as for topic, doctor is not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - あの 人 は 医者 {じゃ ない}。
        english: That person is not a doctor (casual).
        hint: 「じゃない」 is the casual contraction of 「ではない」. We are looking for the polite negative form.
    scene: You are politely clarifying someone's profession to another person.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    conjugation: negative non-past polite (～ません)
    nuance: The polite negative copula 「ではありません」 provides a formal and respectful clarification about
      someone's profession, suitable for an informative context among acquaintances or in public. 「あの方」
      (ano kata) is a more polite way to refer to 'that person' compared to 「あの人」 (ano hito). 「その方」 (sono
      kata) refers to 'that person' already mentioned or nearby. Omitting the topic is possible if the
      context is clear, making the statement more concise while remaining polite.
    etymology: The word 「方」 (kata) meaning 'person' when referring to others, particularly in a polite
      context, derives from the concept of 'direction' or 'side'. This suggests a historical emphasis
      on respecting a person by referring to them indirectly, via their general direction or status, rather
      than directly with a simple 'hito' (人), which is more direct and less formal.
  - english: That story was not true.
    japanese:
      - その 話 {は} 本当 {で は なかっ た}。
      - その 話 {は} 嘘 {だっ た}。
      - その 話 {は} 嘘 {だっ た} よ。
    english_literally: That story, as for topic, true was not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - その 話 は 本当 {じゃ ない}。
        english: That story is not true (present tense).
        hint: 「じゃない」 is the casual present negative. We are looking for the casual past negative.
    scene: You are discussing a rumor with a close friend and revealing it was false.
    register: casual
    setting: serious
    conjugation: negative past plain (～なかった)
    nuance: The plain negative past form 「ではなかった」 is used in casual conversation to state a past fact
      that turned out to be untrue, conveying a straightforward and serious tone among close friends.
      An alternative is 「嘘だった」 (uso datta), meaning 'was a lie,' which is a more direct way to express
      falseness. Adding 「よ」 (yo) to 「嘘だった」 strengthens the assertion and confirms the information for
      the listener, suitable for casual but serious discussions.
    etymology: The word 「嘘」 (uso) meaning 'lie' or 'falsehood' has origins in Old Japanese, stemming from
      words related to 'falsehood' or 'deception'. Its straightforward nature makes it a direct alternative
      to the more descriptive phrase 'not true', demonstrating a common tendency in language to have both
      direct and descriptive expressions for similar concepts.
  - english: His explanation was not clear.
    japanese:
      - 彼 の 説明 {は} 明確 {で は あり ませ ん でし た}。
      - 彼 の 説明 {は} 不 明瞭 {でし た}。
      - ご 説明 {は} 明確 {で は あり ませ ん でし た}。
    english_literally: His explanation, as for topic, clear was not.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 の 説明 は 明確 {で は あり ませ ん}。
        english: His explanation is not clear (present tense).
        hint: 「ありませんでした」 is the polite past negative. We are looking for the polite past negative.
    scene: In a business meeting, you are politely stating that a previous explanation was insufficient.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: professional
    conjugation: negative past polite (～ませんでした)
    nuance: The polite negative past copula 「ではありませんでした」 is appropriate for professional settings, allowing
      one to express a past negative assessment respectfully and formally, such as during a business discussion.
      Using 「不明瞭でした」 (fumeiryō deshita) is a more concise way to say 'was unclear,' as 「不明瞭」 (fumeiryō)
      is the antonym of 「明確」 (meikaku). Using 「ご説明は」 (go-setsumei wa) adds a layer of politeness by prefixing
      「ご」 (go) to the noun 「説明」 (setsumei), often used when speaking about someone else's actions or possessions
      in a respectful manner.
    etymology: The honorific prefix 「ご」 (go) originates from Chinese and was adopted into Japanese to
      denote respect towards the speaker, listener, or the subject being discussed. Its use in 「ご説明」 transforms
      a neutral noun into a polite reference, highlighting the intricate system of honorifics in Japanese
      language, which is deeply rooted in social hierarchy and deference.
  - english: She is very beautiful, isn't she? I think her smile is wonderful.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 {は} とても 綺麗 {です} ね。笑顔 が とても 素敵 {だ} と 思 い ます。
      - 彼女 {は} すごく 綺麗 {です} ね。笑顔 が とても 素敵 {だ} と 思 い ます。
      - 彼女 {は} とても 美人 {です} ね。笑顔 が とても 素敵 {だ} と 思 い ます。
    english_literally: She, as for topic, very beautiful is, isn't it? Smile, as for subject, very wonderful
      is, I think.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 {が} とても 綺麗 です ね。笑顔 が とても 素敵 だ と 思 い ます。
        english: It is *she* who is very beautiful, isn't she? I think her smile is wonderful.
        hint: 「が」 would emphasize 'she' as the specific person who is beautiful, implying a contrast or
          selection. 「は」 introduces 'she' as the general topic of conversation. We are looking for a general
          discussion about the person.
    scene: Two men are observing a woman and one is commenting on her attractiveness. They are talking
      to each other.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: flirty
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: male
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The use of 「です」 and 「だ」 within the same sentence (「綺麗です」 and 「素敵だ」) reflects a natural shift
      between a polite observation and a more definitive, casual internal thought. The final 「と思います」 (to
      omoimasu) softens the assertion, common in general conversation. The casual tone and topic make
      this appropriate for male speakers discussing someone. 「すごく」 (sugoku) is a more casual but equally
      strong alternative to 「とても」 (totemo) for 'very'. 「美人」 (bijin) is a noun meaning 'beautiful person,'
      often used to describe a woman's appearance.
    etymology: The adverb 「すごく」 (sugoku) is the adverbial form of the adjective 「すごい」 (sugoi), which originally
      meant 'frightening' or 'awe-inspiring'. Over time, its meaning broadened to convey strong intensity,
      much like 'terribly' or 'awfully' in English evolving to mean 'very'. This semantic shift illustrates
      how words related to intense emotion can become general intensifiers.
  - english: The atmosphere of this restaurant is very good, isn't it? I think it's perfect for a date.
    japanese:
      - この レストラン の 雰囲気 {は} とても 良い {です} ね。デート に ぴったり {だ} と 思 い ます。
      - この レストラン の 雰囲気 {は} すごく 良い {です} ね。デート に ぴったり {だ} と 思 い ます。
      - この お 店 の 雰囲気 {は} とても 良い {です} ね。デート に ぴったり {だ} と 思 い ます。
    english_literally: This restaurant's atmosphere, as for topic, very good is, isn't it? Date, for,
      perfect is, I think.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この レストラン の 雰囲気 {が} とても 良い です ね。デート に ぴったり だ と 思 い ます。
        english: It is the *atmosphere* of this restaurant that is very good, isn't it? I think it's perfect
          for a date.
        hint: 「が」 emphasizes the atmosphere as the specific thing that is good, perhaps in contrast to
          other aspects of the restaurant. 「は」 sets the atmosphere as the topic for general discussion.
          We are looking for a general observation about the atmosphere.
    scene: A young man is on a first date, subtly suggesting the location is ideal for their outing.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: first-date
    speaker_gender: male
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: younger
    nuance: The combination of 「です」 for politeness and 「ね」 for seeking agreement sets a friendly, engaging
      tone suitable for a first date. The phrase 「デートにぴったりだ」 explicitly connects the setting to the purpose
      of the date, conveying a subtle romantic suggestion while maintaining politeness. 「すごく」 (sugoku)
      is a slightly more casual but still appropriate intensifier than 「とても」 (totemo) for a first date.
      Using 「お店」 (omise) instead of 「レストラン」 (resutoran) is a common, slightly softer way to refer to a
      shop or restaurant, adding a touch of casual familiarity within a polite conversation.
    etymology: The word 「お店」 (omise) is a polite form of 「店」 (mise), meaning 'shop' or 'store'. The prefix
      「お」 (o-) is an honorific prefix, indicating respect for the place or the service it provides. While
      it broadly applies to various establishments, its use for 'restaurant' (レストラン) is common and conveys
      a slightly softer, more colloquial nuance than the direct loanword 'restaurant', which can sound
      more formal in some contexts.
  - english: My younger brother is really active.
    japanese:
      - 私 の 弟 {は} とても 活発 {です}。
      - 私 の 弟 {は} かなり 活発 {です}。
      - 私 の 弟 {は} とても 元気 {です}。
    english_literally: My younger brother, as for topic, very active is.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 私 の 弟 {が} とても 活発 です。
        english: It is *my younger brother* who is very active.
        hint: 「が」 would emphasize 'my younger brother' specifically. 「は」 introduces 'my younger brother'
          as the general topic of conversation. We are looking for a general description of the younger
          brother.
    scene: A sister is describing her younger brother to a family friend.
    register: teineigo (polite)
    setting: informative
    conjugation: non-past polite (～ます)
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: female
    speaker_age: older
    nuance: Using 「です」 maintains politeness suitable for a family friend. 「活発」 (kappatsu) is a na-adjective
      meaning 'active' or 'lively'.
post_example_writeup: It's important to remember that 「は」 marks the topic, not necessarily the grammatical
  subject, of the sentence. The actual subject may be implied or understood from the context. For example,
  in 「今日 は 晴れ です」, while 「今日」 is the topic, the implicit subject that is 'sunny' is the weather, not 'today'
  itself. This distinction between topic and subject is fundamental to understanding Japanese sentence
  structure and correctly using the は particle.
