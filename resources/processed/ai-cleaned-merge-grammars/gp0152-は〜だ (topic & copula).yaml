etymology: The particle 「は」 (wa) derives from the older particle 「葉」 (ha), meaning 'leaf' or 'husk,' evolving
  into a topic marker that subtly 'points' to or 'highlights' the subject of discussion. The copula 「だ」
  itself is a contraction and phonetic change from 「である」 (de aru), which combined 「で」 (an old form of
  「にて」, indicating existence or state) and 「ある」 (to be, exist). Thus, 「は〜だ」 fundamentally states 'as for
  [topic], it exists as [predicate].'
writeup: |-
  The 「は〜だ」 construction is one of the most fundamental sentence patterns in Japanese, serving to identify the topic of a sentence and make a declarative statement about it. It is used when the predicate is a noun or a な-adjective.

  The particle 「は」 (read "wa," despite being written with the hiragana for "ha") marks the topic. The topic is what the sentence is "about." It's often information that is already known or generally understood within the context of the conversation.

  The copula 「だ」 is the plain, casual form of "to be" or "it is." It is used at the end of sentences when the predicate is a noun or a な-adjective. For example, 「私は学生だ」 (Watashi wa gakusei da - I am a student). When using な-adjectives, the 「な」 is dropped before 「だ」, so it becomes 「きれいだ」 (kirei da - it is beautiful).

  The polite equivalent of 「だ」 is 「です」. So, 「私は学生です」 and 「きれいです」 are the polite versions. While 「です」 often functions similarly to 「だ」 in making declarative statements, it inherently carries a polite tone, making it suitable for more formal conversations or when addressing someone of higher status or unfamiliarity. The choice between 「だ」 and 「です」 largely depends on the social context and the relationship between the speakers.

  - term: が (subject marker)
    meaning: marks the subject of a verb or identifies new information
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: While 「は」 marks the topic (what the sentence is about, often known information), 「が」 marks
      the grammatical subject and often introduces new or specific information, or is used when the subject
      is the focus of the sentence.
    grammar_point: が (subject marker)
  - term: Verb[dictionary] (dictionary form)
    meaning: The plain, non-past form of a verb
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「は〜だ」 asserts a statement about a noun or な-adjective using a copula. Verbs, like 「食べる」 (to
      eat), describe actions or states directly and stand alone at the end of a plain sentence, without
      requiring a copula like 「だ」.
    grammar_point: Verb[dictionary] (dictionary form)
  - term: い-Adjective (sentence-ending)
    meaning: An adjective ending in い used to directly describe something
    kind: often confused with
    nuance: 「は〜だ」 is used for nouns and な-adjectives. い-adjectives, such as 「高い」 (expensive), can end
      a sentence directly in their plain form without requiring 「だ」 or 「です」. For example, 「このリンゴは高い」 (This
      apple is expensive).
    grammar_point: <suggest>:い-Adjective (sentence-ending)
post_false_friends_writeup: Understanding the distinction between 「は」 and 「が」 is critical in Japanese.
  Think of 「は」 as setting the stage or context, announcing "as for X, this is what I'm going to say about
  it." In contrast, 「が」 highlights the subject, answering "who or what did/is X?" or introducing new information.
  For verbs and い-adjectives, remember that they naturally complete a sentence in their plain forms without
  needing 「だ」 or 「です」, unlike nouns and な-adjectives which almost always require a copula to form a complete
  declarative sentence.
