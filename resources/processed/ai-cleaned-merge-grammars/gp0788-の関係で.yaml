        "Register": "Standard Japanese; can be used in both formal and informal settings, though more common in relatively formal contexts.",
        "Function": "Indicates a reason or cause for a particular situation or outcome.",
        "Nuance": "Implies a causal relationship, where the noun directly influences the result. It's a versatile phrase for explaining reasons or circumstances."
    },
    "etymology": "「関係 (かんけい)」 means \"relationship\" or \"connection\".  The addition of 「の」 makes it adjectival, and 「で」 indicates the reason or means by which something occurs.  Thus, literally, it means \"in the relationship of\" which is then used to express \"because of the relationship of\" or \"due to the connection with\".",
    "writeup": "「の関係で」 indicates that something happens or does not happen because of a particular reason or circumstance. It's similar to \"due to\" or \"because of\" in English. It is more commonly used in relatively formal contexts. 「関係」 means \"relationship\" or \"connection\".\n\n*   **Usage**: It's a versatile phrase used to explain reasons or circumstances, often in a formal or semi-formal context. It suggests a direct causal relationship between the noun and the resulting situation.\n*   **Alternatives**: While 「ので」 and 「から」 can also express reasons, 「の関係で」 emphasizes the connection or relationship as the cause.",
