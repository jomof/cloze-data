  - term: さすが
    meaning: as one would expect, only natural, that is just like..., even
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: Unlike 「はたして」, 「さすが」 expresses admiration or praise for something that meets expectations,
      whereas 「はたして」 is more neutral or doubtful, focusing on the outcome's certainty or predictability.
    grammar_point: さすが (as expected even)
  - term: かな
    meaning: I wonder...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「かな」 expresses a simple sense of wonder. 「はたして」 adds more emphasis or doubt to that wonder,
      implying a deeper level of questioning or skepticism.
    grammar_point: かな (I wonder)
  - term: 〜のだろうか
    meaning: I wonder...
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「〜のだろうか」 expresses a wondering tone in a question, but adding 「はたして」 emphasizes the doubt
      the speaker has, intensifying the inquiry or uncertainty.
    grammar_point: のだろうか (I wonder)
  - term: まさしく
    meaning: precisely, exactly, surely
    kind: similar expression
    nuance: 「まさしく」 conveys a strong sense of certainty and exactness, affirming that something is precisely
      as stated or expected. While 「はたして」 can confirm expectations, it also carries a nuance of initial
      doubt or a deeper, probing inquiry that 「まさしく」 does not.
    grammar_point: <suggest>:まさしく (precisely・exactly)
post_false_friends_writeup: While 「さすが」, 「かな」, and 「〜のだろうか」 share some overlap with 「はたして」, they carry
  distinct nuances. Use 「さすが」 when you want to express admiration, 「かな」 for simple wonder, and 「〜のだろうか」
  for expressing an actual question. 「まさしく」, on the other hand, is a strong affirmation. Choose 「はたして」
  when you want to emphasize doubt or confirm an expectation, often with a sense of relief or resignation
  that something turned out to be true.
examples:
  - english: I wonder if the world is truly warming.
    japanese:
      - 世界 は {はたして} 本当 に 温暖 化 し て いる の だろう か。
      - 世界 は {はたして} 本当 に 温暖 化 し て いる の でしょう か。
      - 世界 は {はたして} 本当 に 温暖 化 し て いる の か。
    english_literally: World, indeed, really warming, is it, I wonder?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 世界 は 本当 に 温暖 化 し て いる {の だろう か}。
        english: I wonder if the world is warming.
        hint: The original sentence with 「はたして」 expresses a stronger, more profound doubt or inquiry about
          the truth. We're looking for a sentence that conveys that deeper level of questioning.
    scene: A scientist expresses deep uncertainty about climate change data during a panel discussion,
      raising questions about the extent and veracity of the claims.
    register: formal
    setting: academic
    nuance: The combination of 「はたして」 and 「～なのだろうか」 highlights a profound skepticism or a serious, probing
      inquiry into the truth of global warming, characteristic of a critical academic perspective. It
      suggests a strong, perhaps internal, debate about the facts.
    etymology: The term 「温暖化 (ondan-ka)」 refers to 'warming' or 'global warming'. It is a compound of
      「温暖 (ondan)」 meaning 'warm' and 「化 (ka)」 which is a suffix meaning 'to change into' or 'to become'.
      This word clearly expresses the concept of becoming warm, which is central to the example's context
      of climate change.
  - english: I wonder if this plan will truly succeed.
    japanese:
      - この 計画 は {はたして} 成功 する の でしょう か。
      - この 計画 は {はたして} 成功 する の だろう か。
      - この 計画 は {はたして} 成功 する の か。
    english_literally: This plan, indeed, succeed, will it, I wonder?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 計画 は 成功 する {の でしょう か}。
        english: I wonder if this plan will succeed.
        hint: The original sentence with 「はたして」 adds a stronger emphasis on the speaker's serious doubt
          or skepticism about the plan's success. We're looking for that heightened sense of uncertainty.
    scene: A new project manager expresses deep concern to their mentor about the feasibility of an ambitious
      new company project, questioning its ultimate success.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: professional
    nuance: 「はたして」 emphasizes the speaker's serious doubt about the success of the plan, while 「～のでしょうか」
      maintains politeness suitable for a professional setting. The new project manager's concern implies
      a lack of confidence in the outcome.
    etymology: The word 「計画 (keikaku)」 means 'plan' or 'project'. It combines 「計 (kei)」, referring to
      'to measure' or 'to plan', and 「画 (kaku)」, referring to 'a drawing' or 'a plan'. This compound word
      embodies the idea of laying out a careful scheme or design, which is relevant to the manager's contemplation
      in the scene.
  - english: As a result of many years of effort, her dream indeed came true.
    japanese:
      - 長年 の 努力 の 結果、{はたして} 彼女 の 夢 が 叶っ た。
      - 長年 の 努力 の 結果、{はたして} 彼女 の 夢 が 叶い まし た。
    english_literally: Many years' effort's result, indeed, her dream came true.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 長年 の 努力 の 結果、彼女 の 夢 が {叶っ た}。
        english: As a result of many years of effort, her dream came true.
        hint: The original sentence with 「はたして」 specifically highlights that the outcome was 'as expected'
          or 'sure enough,' fulfilling a prior anticipation. We're looking for that sense of confirmed
          predictability.
    scene: A narrator describes a protagonist in a story who, after persistent dedication, finally achieves
      a long-held ambition.
    register: formal
    setting: storytelling
    nuance: 「はたして」 here confirms that the outcome (dream coming true) was the natural and expected consequence
      of the efforts, fulfilling a prior anticipation. It adds a sense of poetic justice or inevitability
      to the successful realization of a long-term goal.
    etymology: 「叶う (kanau)」 means 'to come true' or 'to be realized', often used for wishes, dreams, or
      hopes. Its kanji 「叶」 is formed from 「口 (kuchi, mouth)」 and 「十 (jū, ten/complete)」, suggesting that
      when words are spoken completely, they come true. In the context of long-term effort, this verb
      emphasizes the fulfillment of aspirations.
  - english: Ignoring repeated warnings, the business was, as expected, a huge failure.
    japanese:
      - 度重なる 警告 を 無視 し た 結果、{はたして} その 事業 は 大 失敗 だっ た。
      - 度重なる 警告 を 無視 し た 結果、{はたして} その 事業 は 大 失敗 でし た。
    english_literally: Repeated warnings ignored, result, indeed, that business huge failure was.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 度重なる 警告 を 無視 し た 結果、その 事業 は {大 失敗 だっ た}。
        english: Ignoring repeated warnings, the business was a huge failure.
        hint: The original sentence with 「はたして」 emphasizes that the failure was not just a fact, but a
          predictable consequence of the ignored warnings. We're looking for that explicit confirmation
          of expectation.
    scene: A consultant reviews a past case where a company's stubbornness led to a predictable collapse,
      highlighting the consequences of poor judgment.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「はたして」 reinforces the predictability of the negative outcome, emphasizing that the failure
      was a direct and expected consequence of ignoring the warnings. It conveys a sense of unfortunate
      but unsurprising fulfillment of an anticipated negative event.
    etymology: The phrase 「大失敗 (dai-shippai)」 literally means 'big failure' or 'grand failure', combining
      「大 (dai)」 meaning 'big' and 「失敗 (shippai)」 meaning 'failure'. It is a common compound word in Japanese
      to express significant setbacks. The scene highlights this as an inevitable consequence. The use
      of 「度重なる (tabikasunaru)」 implies that the warnings were given multiple times, intensifying the feeling
      that the failure was self-inflicted and completely foreseeable, hence 「はたして」 is particularly fitting
      here. This use of kanji, especially 「度重なる」 (N3), is appropriate for the N2 level.
  - english: I wonder if he'll really come on time.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は {はたして} 時間 通り に 来る の か な。
      - 彼 は {はたして} 時間 通り に 来る だろう か。
      - 彼 は {はたして} 時間 通り に 来る ん だろう か。
    english_literally: He, indeed, time-on-time, come, I wonder?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 時間 通り に 来る {の か な}。
        english: I wonder if he'll come on time.
        hint: The original sentence uses 「はたして」 to add a stronger, more genuine doubt or skepticism to
          the casual question, reflecting a deeper level of questioning. We're looking for that emphasized
          doubt.
    scene: A female friend is waiting for a male friend who is notoriously late, expressing mild skepticism
      to herself while checking her watch.
    register: casual
    setting: friendly
    speaker_gender: female
    listener_gender: no one
    nuance: 「はたして」 here adds a sense of genuine uncertainty or mild doubt to the casual 「～かな」, reflecting
      the speaker's internal questioning about the friend's punctuality. The use of 「かな」 is commonly heard
      from female speakers for expressing soft speculation.
    etymology: 「時間 通り (jikan-doori)」 means 'on time' or 'according to schedule'. 「時間 (jikan)」 means 'time',
      and 「通り (doori)」 comes from 「通る (tooru)」 meaning 'to pass through' or 'to go along', and when used
      as a suffix, it means 'according to' or 'as per'. This phrase precisely indicates adherence to a
      set time, which is the crux of the speaker's doubt.
  - english: Her intuition was sharp, and indeed, her prediction came true.
    japanese:
      - 彼女 の 直感 は 鋭く、{はたして} その 予測 は 的中 し た。
      - 彼女 の 直感 は 鋭く、{はたして} その 予測 は 的中 し まし た。
    english_literally: Her intuition sharp, indeed, that prediction hit the mark.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼女 の 直感 は 鋭く、その 予測 は {的中 し た}。
        english: Her intuition was sharp, and her prediction came true.
        hint: The original sentence uses 「はたして」 to emphasize that the prediction was 'indeed' or 'sure
          enough' accurate, reinforcing the uncanny fulfillment of expectation. We're looking for that
          strong confirmation.
    scene: A documentary narrator highlights a historical figure known for consistently accurate premonitions
      and foresight in critical situations.
    register: formal
    setting: informative
    nuance: This formal usage of 「はたして」 emphasizes the unerring accuracy of her intuition, serving as
      a strong confirmation that the prediction was fulfilled exactly as anticipated. It lends weight
      and credibility to the statement about her exceptional ability.
    etymology: 「直感 (chokkan)」 means 'intuition' or 'instinct'. It is composed of 「直 (choku)」 meaning 'direct'
      and 「感 (kan)」 meaning 'feeling' or 'sense'. This term clearly conveys a direct, unmediated understanding
      or feeling, which is precisely what is described as being sharp in the example.
  - english: In this situation, I wonder how we should truly act.
    japanese:
      - この 状況 で、{はたして} 私 たち は どう 行動 する べき な の だろう か。
      - この 状況 で、{はたして} 私 たち は どう 行動 する べき な の でしょう か。
      - この 状況 で、{はたして} 私 たち は どう 行動 する べき な の か。
    english_literally: This situation, indeed, we how act should, I wonder?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 状況 で、私 たち は どう 行動 する べき {な の だろう か}。
        english: In this situation, I wonder how we should act.
        hint: The original sentence uses 「はたして」 to convey a strong sense of internal questioning and profound
          uncertainty, suggesting a highly complex problem. We're looking for that intensified deliberation.
    scene: A team leader addresses their colleagues during a crisis, expressing profound uncertainty and
      seeking guidance on the best course of action.
    register: formal
    setting: serious
    nuance: 「はたして」 combined with 「どう～べきなのだろうか」 conveys a strong sense of internal questioning about the
      correct course of action in a difficult situation. It implies the speaker sees it as a highly complex
      or uncertain problem requiring careful deliberation.
    etymology: The phrase 「行動 する べき (koudou suru beki)」 means 'should act'. 「べき」 comes from a classical
      Japanese auxiliary verb emphasizing obligation or advisability. 「行動 (koudou)」 (N3) refers to 'action'
      or 'conduct', commonly seen in professional or formal contexts like the scene describes. This is
      a common and natural way to express what one 'should' do in a serious discussion.
  - english: I wonder if he's really a teacher.
    japanese:
      - 彼 は {はたして} 先生 な の だろう か。
      - 彼 は {はたして} 先生 な の でしょう か。
    english_literally: He, indeed, teacher, is he, I wonder?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 は 先生 {な の だろう か}。
        english: I wonder if he's a teacher.
        hint: The original sentence with 「はたして」 adds a stronger emphasis to the doubt about his profession,
          implying that his actions don't quite fit the expected behavior of a teacher. We're looking
          for that amplified sense of questioning.
    scene: Two students are whispering about a new, rather unconventional teacher who sometimes seems
      more like a peer than an instructor.
    register: semi-formal
    setting: interrogative
    nuance: Using 「はたして」 with a noun and 「～なのだろうか」 expresses a genuine and deeper doubt about someone's
      identity or role. It implies that the speaker has observed something that makes them question the
      stated truth, going beyond simple curiosity.
    etymology: 「先生 (sensei)」 literally means 'one born before', traditionally referring to a teacher,
      master, or doctor. It implies someone who has gained knowledge or experience ahead of others. The
      nuanced doubt about whether someone 'really' is a sensei often comes from their behavior not aligning
      with the respect or expertise implied by the title.
  - english: I wonder if this food is truly delicious.
    japanese:
      - この 料理 は {はたして} 本当 に 美味しい の だろう か。
      - この 料理 は {はたして} 本当 に 美味しい の でしょう か。
    english_literally: This food, indeed, really delicious, is it, I wonder?
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - この 料理 は 本当 に 美味しい {の だろう か}。
        english: I wonder if this food is delicious.
        hint: The original sentence with 「はたして」 conveys a stronger, more profound skepticism about the
          taste, perhaps despite its appearance or reputation. We're looking for that intensified doubt.
    scene: A food critic is trying a new, highly-praised but strange-looking dish that has received mixed
      reviews, causing them to question its actual quality.
    register: formal
    setting: reflective
    nuance: 「はたして」 combined with 「本当 に 美味しい の だろう か」 signifies a deep, almost existential, doubt about
      the subjective experience of taste. It suggests that the speaker is trying to objectively assess
      something that is inherently personal, expressing skepticism about its true quality despite external
      claims or expectations.
    etymology: 「美味しい (oishii)」 is a common Japanese adjective meaning 'delicious' or 'tasty'. Its origin
      is thought to be from 「旨し (umashi)」, an older form meaning 'good-tasting'. When paired with 「はたして」,
      the question of its deliciousness becomes more profound, often implying that initial impressions
      or prior information are being challenged.
  - english: Even if he really is a genius, he still needs to put in effort.
    japanese:
      - 彼 が {はたして} 天才 だ と し て も、やはり 努力 は 必要 だ。
      - 彼 が {はたして} 天才 だ と し て も、やはり 努力 は 必要 です。
      - 彼 が {はたして} 天才 で あろう と、やはり 努力 は 必要 だ。
      - 彼 が {はたして} 天才 で あろう と、やはり 努力 は 必要 です。
      - 彼 が {はたして} 天才 だろう と、やはり 努力 は 必要 だ。
      - 彼 が {はたして} 天才 だろう と、やはり 努力 は 必要 です.
    english_literally: He, indeed, genius, even if, still effort necessary is.
    competing_grammar:
      - competing_japanese:
          - 彼 が 天才 だ {と し て も}、やはり 努力 は 必要 だ。
        english: Even if he is a genius, he still needs to put in effort.
        hint: The original sentence uses 「はたして」 to emphasize that the premise (being a genius) is something
          that is strongly questioned or doubted by the speaker, adding a layer of skepticism to the concession.
          We're looking for that strong reservation about the 'genius' claim.
    scene: A mentor advises a talented but somewhat lazy protégé, emphasizing that natural ability alone
      is not enough for success.
    register: formal
    setting: instructional
    nuance: Here, 「はたして」 within the 「～だとしても」 clause serves to highlight the speaker's skepticism about
      whether the person *truly* is a genius. It implies that while granting the possibility for the sake
      of argument, the speaker fundamentally questions the premise, making the subsequent insistence on
      effort even stronger.
    etymology: The word 「天才 (tensai)」 means 'genius' or 'prodigy'. It is a compound of 「天 (ten)」 meaning
      'heaven' or 'nature', and 「才 (sai)」 meaning 'talent' or 'ability'. This implies a natural, heaven-bestowed
      talent. The phrase 「努力 は 必要 だ (doryoku wa hitsuyou da)」 means 'effort is necessary', a fundamental
      concept in Japanese culture that even natural talent requires cultivation. The use of 「はたして」 in
      this context highlights a pragmatic, results-oriented perspective that values demonstrable effort
      over unverified innate ability.
post_example_writeup: 「はたして」 can be used in various contexts to express wonder or confirm expectations.
  It often adds a layer of emphasis or skepticism to the statement.
