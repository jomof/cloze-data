    "etymology": "The word 「まま」 comes from the kanji 「儘」, which means \"as it is.\" It describes the unchanged state of something.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「ままに」 (mama ni) means \"as is,\" \"while remaining,\" or \"left in a state.\" It suggests that something remains unchanged or undisturbed. 「まま」 is a noun describing an unchanged state. While often followed by the particle 「に」, it's frequently omitted, though including 「に」 adds emphasis. It's versatile and can be used with nouns, verbs, and adjectives. With verbs, it often follows the past form (た-form), indicating something was left in a certain state. Sometimes 「まま」 is pronounced 「まんま」 in casual speech.",
