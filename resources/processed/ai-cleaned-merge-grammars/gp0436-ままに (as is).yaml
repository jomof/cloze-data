    "etymology": "「まま」 comes from the kanji 「儘」, which means \"as it is.\" It describes the unchanged state of something.",
    "writeup": "「まま」, derived from the kanji 「儘」 meaning \"as it is\", is a noun that describes something's unchanged state. It translates to \"while remaining (A),\" \"as (A) is,\" or \"left in the state of (A).\" This grammar point follows words in their attributive form. When used with verbs, it is most frequently seen with the past (た) form. When used with the negative (ない) form, 「まま」 often expresses that something should be left alone or undisturbed.\n\nWhile 「まま」 can be followed by the case marking particle 「に」, it is very often omitted. The presence of 「に」 places extra emphasis on the following verb in the sentence. Note that 「まま」 can also be pronounced as 「まんま」. This variation is primarily used in casual speech or writing that aims to sound conversational.",
