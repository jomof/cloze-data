    "etymology": "「まま」 comes from the kanji 「儘」, which means \"as it is.\" It describes the unchanged state of something.",
    "writeup": "「まま」, derived from the kanji 「儘」 meaning \"as it is\", is a noun that describes something's unchanged state. It translates to \"while remaining (A),\" \"as (A) is,\" or \"left in the state of (A).\" This grammar point follows words in their attributive form. When used with verbs, it is most frequently seen with the past (た) form. When used with the negative (ない) form, 「まま」 often expresses that something should be left alone or undisturbed.\n\nWhile 「まま」 can be followed by the case marking particle 「に」, it is very often omitted. The presence of 「に」 places extra emphasis on the following verb in the sentence. Note that 「まま」 can also be pronounced as 「まんま」. This variation is primarily used in casual speech or writing that aims to sound conversational.",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "Unlike 「ままに」, 「てある」 describes a state resulting from a deliberate action and often implies purpose or preparation. 「ままに」 focuses on the mere continuation of a state."

            "term": "っぱなし",

            "kind": "similar expression",
            "nuance": "「っぱなし」 often carries a negative connotation, implying negligence or carelessness, or leaving something unattended. 「ままに」 is generally neutral."

            "nuance": "「きり」 indicates a limit or boundary, suggesting that an action or state has continued *only* up to a certain point or that *only* one thing has happened. 「ままに」 describes an ongoing or unchanged state without emphasizing limitation."

            "nuance": "「たなり・なり」 is often a more literary or slightly archaic expression with a wider range of meanings including 'as soon as' or 'ever since'. While it can describe a remaining state, 「ままに」 more specifically refers to the simple continuation of a state."
