    "etymology": "「まま」 comes from the kanji 「儘」, which means \"as it is.\" It describes the unchanged state of something.",
    "writeup": "「まま」, derived from the kanji 「儘」 meaning \"as it is\", is a noun that describes something's unchanged state. It translates to \"while remaining (A),\" \"as (A) is,\" or \"left in the state of (A).\" It follows attributive-form words. With verbs, it's often used with the past (た) form. 「まま」 often implies that something should be left alone or undisturbed, especially with verbs in the 「ない」 form.\n\nAlthough 「まま」 can be followed by the particle 「に」, it's often omitted. The 「に」 adds emphasis to the following verb. 「まま」 can also be pronounced as 「まんま」, mainly in casual speech.",
