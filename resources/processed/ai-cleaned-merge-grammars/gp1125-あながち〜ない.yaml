        "Register": "Formal writing and formal speech.",
        "Usage": "Often used to soften a statement or to express that something is not completely false or wrong."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「あながち」originally meant \"forcefully\" or \"excessively.\" Over time, it evolved to mean \"necessarily\" when used with a negative, implying that something is not necessarily the case to that degree.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「あながち〜ない」 is used to express that something is **not necessarily** the case, or **not entirely** true. It suggests that there may be exceptions or that the opposite could also be true. It's often used to soften a statement, indicating that while something might seem a certain way, it's not definitively so. This expression is primarily used in formal writing and speech. It is similar to 「必ずしも〜ない」 (kanarazushimo ~nai), but 「あながち〜ない」 carries a nuance of **partially** acknowledging the possibility, while still expressing doubt.",
