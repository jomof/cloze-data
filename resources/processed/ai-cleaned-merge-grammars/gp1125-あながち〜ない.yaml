        "あながち + [Negative Predicate]": "Indicates that something is not necessarily true or the case; used to express that something is not entirely or always so."

    "jlpt": "N1",
    "meaning": "Not necessarily; not always; not entirely.",
    "details": {
        "Register": "Formal; often used in writing and formal speech.",
        "Usage": "Used to soften a statement or express doubt about its absolute certainty.",
        "Connotation": "Implies that there might be exceptions or alternative possibilities to a given assertion."
    },
    "etymology": "The term 「あながち」 itself doesn't have a clear etymological origin, but it is believed to have evolved from older forms of Japanese. It functions as an adverb that modifies the negative predicate, suggesting a partial or limited negation rather than a complete denial. It's often used to add nuance and subtlety to an argument or statement.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「あながち〜ない」 is used to express that something is not necessarily true or the case. It conveys the meaning of \"not necessarily,\" \"not always,\" or \"not entirely.\" It's commonly used in formal speech and writing to soften a statement or express doubt about its absolute certainty. It implies that there might be exceptions or alternative possibilities to a given assertion. For example, saying 「あながち嘘ではない」 means \"it's not necessarily a lie,\" suggesting it could be true to some extent.",
