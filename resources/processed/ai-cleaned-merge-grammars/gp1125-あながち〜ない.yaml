    "etymology": "The term 「あながち」 itself doesn't have a clear etymological origin, but it is believed to have evolved from older forms of Japanese. It functions as an adverb that modifies the negative predicate, suggesting a partial or limited negation rather than a complete denial. It's often used to add nuance and subtlety to an argument or statement.",
    "writeup": "The grammar point 「あながち〜ない」 is a sophisticated expression used to convey that something is not necessarily true or the case. It translates to \"not necessarily,\" \"not always,\" or \"not entirely.\" This construction is primarily found in formal writing and speech, lending a nuanced and refined tone to the discourse. It serves to soften a statement or to express doubt about its absolute certainty, suggesting that while an initial impression or common belief might exist, there are exceptions or it is not entirely absolute. When used, it implies a careful consideration of possibilities and a reluctance to make definitive, all-encompassing negative statements. It highlights the speaker's recognition that reality is often more complex than a simple binary true/false.",

            "nuance": "Both 「あながち〜ない」 and 「必ずしも〜ない」 convey the idea that something is not always the case. However, 「あながち〜ない」 often implies a stronger sense of doubt or reservation, leaning towards a partial truth rather than a complete denial, whereas 「必ずしも〜ない」 is a more general statement about non-absolute truth."
        }
    ],
    "post_false_friends_writeup": "While both 「あながち〜ない」 and 「必ずしも〜ない」 express the idea of \"not necessarily,\" 「あながち〜ない」 tends to carry a more nuanced sense of skepticism or doubt about a specific assertion. It suggests that while something might appear to be entirely true or false, it is not *necessarily* so in all aspects. Use 「あながち〜ない」 when you want to suggest that something might not be as true as it seems, implying there are exceptions or complexities. In contrast, 「必ずしも〜ない」 is a more straightforward way of saying something isn't always the case, often without the underlying nuance of an expected, but not entirely accurate, assumption.",
