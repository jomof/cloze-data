  writeup: というところis a grammar expression that is used when highlighting an approximate number or degree
    for something. It is a combination of the case-marking particle と, the う-Verb言う 'to say', and the
    noun ところ 'place', which often marks situations. Common translations include 'I would say about (A)',
    'I guess about (A)'. A more literal translation is 'To be at the point where saying (A) is accurate'.It
    is most common for this structure to appear following either verbs or nouns, but may also occasionally
    follow adjectives. Coming primarily at the end of sentences,というところwill often be followed immediately
    by theauxiliary verbだ or です.Occasionally, という will be replaced by the past-tense form, といった. However,
    the meaning does not change at all in these cases.Cautionというところhas a tendency to be used when the
    number being given is the theoretical maximum for something, rather than the theoretical minimum.
    Due to this, it may sound unnatural when wanting to present an approximate minimum.
