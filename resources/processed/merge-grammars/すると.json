    "writeup": "すると, a combination of する and theconjunction particleと, is generally considered to be an abbreviation ofそうすると, and means that 'once (A) is done, (B)', or 'upon (A), (B)'.するとis usually used at the beginning of a new sentence, to highlight something that occurred due to the circumstances mentioned in the previous sentence/statement.As a standalone statement,するとis classified as aconjunction.CautionThe 'result' thatするとconveys, should always be one of two specific things. Something that the speaker has no control over, or a conclusion/determination that the speaker wants to confirm is correct (based on their understanding of the previous statement).Whenするとis used to draw a conclusion about another person's statement, the translation is closer to 'so you mean to say (A)', or 'if so, then (A)'.",
