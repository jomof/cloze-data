  writeup: 愈々, seen primarily in hiragana, is an adverb that indicates that (A) has or will 'finally happen'.
    In many cases this is after some state that has been continuing for a long time, or has been compounding
    further and further until (A).Like many other sentence altering adverbs,いよいよwill appear at the beginning
    of a phrase. It is also considered quite casual when compared to other grammar points like ついに.Asいよいよhighlights
    something that is compounding, it can also frequently be translated as 'more and more'.The difference
    between the nuance ofいよいよbeing 'finally' or 'more and more' will usually be clear due to the statement
    following it being either conclusive (finally), or inconclusive (more and more).
