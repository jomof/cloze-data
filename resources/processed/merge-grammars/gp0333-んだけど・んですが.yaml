  writeup: んだけどis an expression that combinesんだ(explaining/giving cause), withけど(but). Together they translate
    simply as 'but...', although the nuance is actually closer to 'but with (A) as the reason… (B)', while
    (B) is sometimes left unsaid. This implies that the speaker is looking for a reply, or does not want
    to say the (B) part of the sentence out of politeness/awkwardness.There are several different forms
    of this construction that are mostly interchangeable with each other. From most casual, to most formal,
    they are as follows:んだけど、んだけれど、んだけれども、んだが、んですがんmay be replaced withのin any of the above expressions.
    However, it will again make it slightly more formal.Cautionんだが, or simplyだがis probably the 'strongest'
    out of these possibilities, and is considered quite masculine. If you are going to use this form,
    we recommend making sure that your tone is a bit softer, so that it does not sound too authoritative.Fun
    Factん (or の)may sometimes be omitted completely, but this is not so common in modern Japanese.
