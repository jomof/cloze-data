    "writeup": "When following the た, past-tense form of a verb, theconjunction particleなり 'shape' indicates something existing in an ongoing state, similar to まま. This may be translated as 'while (A)', or 'remaining (A)'.Due to〜たなりsentences usually describing something happening while in the state of (A), it will often be followed directly by a comma, or by theconjunctive formof theauxiliary verbだ, で. After this, the (B) phrase will then describe what is happening during (A).〜たなりwill primarily be used to express an undesirable state continuing despite (A) having happened, although this is not a strict rule.As〜たなりindicates that (A) is something that is continuing to stay in the same state, it will often have the nuance of 'ever since (A)' in situations where a significant amount of time has passed.CautionThis なり derives from the noun形'shape' in its hiragana form, and is different to the なり that is used as the classic copula.",
