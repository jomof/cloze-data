  grammar_point: であれ〜であれ
  jlpt: N1
  meaning: Whether or, Or, No matter which, In either case
  meaning_warning: null
  details:
    Register: Formal
    使用域: 硬い
  writeup: Functioning as an extension of である, the formal copula that is a combination of theconjunctive
    formof theauxiliary verbだ, and the う-Verb ある,であれorであろうとwill be used in order to express strong will
    or conviction.あれ is simply theimperative formof ある, while あろうと is the positive volitional form combined
    with thecase marking particleと. Both structures are usually translated as 'even if (A), (B)', or 'no
    matter if (A), (B)'. Despite this, the more literal meaning of each is closer to 'so it's (A), (B)
    still won't be affected'. This just emphasizes the fact that (A) is of no relation to the result,
    like saying 'so what if it is' in English.When used consecutively, てあれ shows that regardless of whether
    something is (A) or (B), the result of (C), will not change.Bothであれandであろうとwill primarily attach tonounsin
    sentences that express some kind of question or assumption through words like どんな or たとえ.CautionAlthough〜であれ〜であれimplies
    'no matter whether it is (A) or (B)', both (A) and (B) in these types of sentences usually fall under
    the same category, as (C) needs to be something that links them logically. For example (A) may be
    'a plane', and (B) may be 'a submarine', while (C) will be describing something about them both being
    vehicles.
