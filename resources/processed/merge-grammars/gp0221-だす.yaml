  writeup: だす, or出すin its kanji form is a verb that is regularly attached to theconjunctive formof other
    verbs. When it is connected in this way, it has the meaning of 'to suddenly do (A)', or 'to burst
    into (A)'.To use this construction, simply addだすto the ます stem (conjunctive form) of the verb that
    you want to highlight as happening 'suddenly'.CautionUnlikeはじめる, another common structure which means
    'to begin',だすquite often has the nuance of being unintentional, or something that the subject cannot
    avoid doing (or cannot be controlled). On the other hand,はじめるexpresses the direct intention of the
    subject to do (A).
