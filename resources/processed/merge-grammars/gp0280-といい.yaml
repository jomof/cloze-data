  writeup: One of the regular uses of theとparticle is to express 'if'. However, unlike some other structures
    (likeなら,たら, andば),とimplies that the 'if' result ofとis something that will definitely happen, or is
    a natural consequence of (A) happening. When combined with theい-Adjectiveいい, it means 'if (A), it
    would be good'.This construction may be used with any phrase ending in a word in itsstandard form.Becauseとexpresses
    a 'certain' outcome, the 'good' in this grammar construction often sounds quite strong, leading toといいregularly
    being translated closer to 'I hope (A)', or 'I wish (A)'.There are several situations in which this
    grammar point can be used to express that you are hoping something for yourself, or hoping something
    for someone else. This is primarily determined by the use of な, orんだけど(hoping for yourself), orね(hoping
    for others/mutual benefit).CautionWhen this expression finishes withけど,けれども, orが, it can imply that
    there are some external factors that will make the desired result difficult to achieve.
