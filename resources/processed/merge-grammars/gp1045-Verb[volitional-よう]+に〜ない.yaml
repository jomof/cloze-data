  writeup: に〜ないis a construction which appears with repeating verbs in Japanese to indicate that one 'cannot
    (A) even if they want to', or 'due to some circumstances, can't (A)'. thecase marking particleに will
    appear after a verb in itsdictionary form, before the potential form of the same verb will be negated
    with ない. In this way, the more literal meaning is 'for (A), (A) is not possible'.It will be important
    to keep in mind that する does not have a potential form, so できない will be used in the latter half of
    this expression when paired with する verbs.Additionally, ない may sometimes be replaced with other structures
    that convey negation, such as ず.CautionOccasionally, thedictionary formof a verb will be replaced
    with theauxiliary verbう or よう volitional forms, and will then be followed by にも. The potential form
    of the same verb coming before ない will remain the same.Although the meanings are the same between
    both of these, thedictionary formtends to highlight psychological circumstances for why one 'cannot
    (A)', while the volitional form highlights more concrete or physical circumstances.
