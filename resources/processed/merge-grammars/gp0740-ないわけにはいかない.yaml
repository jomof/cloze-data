  writeup: As an extension of the grammar pattern訳にはいかない'can't afford to do (A)', or 'impossible to do
    (A)',ない訳にはいかないcreates a double negative which is frequently translated simply as 'can't not (A)',
    or 'no way to avoid (A)'.As this is a combination of the negated form of a verb,訳'reason', or 'logic',
    に, は, and the negated form of行く, the literal meaning is just 'there's no reason that (A) can't be
    done', or 'it cannot be so that (A) won't be done'.Compared to other similar structures like なければならない,
    ないといけない, and various others,ない訳にはいかないimplies that there are some circumstances as to why (A) cannot
    be avoided, so will often be used when giving an excuse or reasoning as to why one must do (A).
