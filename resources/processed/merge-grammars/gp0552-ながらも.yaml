  writeup: ながらもis a combination of theconjunction particleながら, and theadverbial particleも. Coming from
    the kanji乍ら, with the meaning of 'while', ながら almost always keeps this nuance. Because of this,ながらもcan
    be translated as 'even while (A), (B)', or 'although (A), also (B)'.ながらもusually expresses surprise
    at the coexistence of (A) and (B), and may be used afterい-Adjectives,な-Adjectives, nouns, or theconjunctive
    formof verbs.ながらもis used to highlight a thing that comes after the existing state of (A) 'そのままで後に続く事'.
    Due to this,ながらもmay only be used with verbs that highlight states of existence (like feelings), rather
    than ongoing actions.
