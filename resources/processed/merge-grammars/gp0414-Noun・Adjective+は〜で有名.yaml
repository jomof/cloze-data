  writeup: In order to describe what certain things/places are famous for, 〜は〜で有名is a common expression
    that will be used. This construction is made up of theadverbial particleは, thecase marking particleで,
    and有名, a noun that may also be used as anな-Adjective.〜は〜で有名 is usually translated as '(A) is famous
    for (B)', but literally means 'with (B), (A) is famous/renowned'. The structure may be broken down
    in the following way:(A) は - Presents (A) as the topic.(B) で - With (B), in で's use as 'with'.有名だ
    - Is famous.As can be seen from these examples, こと (or の) may precede で有名. This is quite common when
    an entire phrase is being described as the famous aspect of (A), rather than a single word.CautionIf有名is
    being used as aな-Adjective, it will appear before the famous thing/place itself. This form will usually
    be utilized when the speaker wants to give further detail about exactly what (A) is.
