  writeup: ここ is one of the forms of the これ family of words used to identify things close to the speaker.
    In this case it demonstrates a place. In the same way that これ represents 'this', ここ represents 'this
    place', or simply 'here'.Fun FactThe full family of words used for identification/demonstration in
    Japanese are referred to as こそあど 言葉 (KO, SO, A, DO words). These include all of the different forms
    of これ , それ , あれ , and どれ .Cautionここ should not be confused with こっち, a similar word which is also
    sometimes translated as 'here'. こっち focuses more on the direction that one is/is going, while ここ focuses
    purely on 'this (stationary) place'.

    - japanese: こっちに来ますか?
      english: Will you come here? (Focus on the movement)
    - japanese: ここに来ますか?
      english: Will you come to this place? (Focus on the place)
