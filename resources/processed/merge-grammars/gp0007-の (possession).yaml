  writeup: From the perspective of English, の has several different meanings. It can indicate possession,
    like putting (A)'s on the end of a word. In Japanese, however, the meaning is a bit broader, and shows
    that (B) is an attribute/possession of (A).In the first sentence, we can see that の is showing ownership,
    however in the second sentence, it is simply showing a relationship between (A) and (B).の is also
    often used in the same way as が , to highlight the subject of a statement. Our lesson for が will be
    covered separately.Both of these examples are slightly advanced and use adjectives, but don't worry,
    we will be covering them next!Cautionの is usually used after nouns, but can also be used after other
    types of words, specifically when it is transforming them into a noun-like phrase. This is called
    nominalization in English. We will cover this in detail in the の - Nominalization grammar point.
  examples:
    - japanese: あれは私のペンです。
      english: That over there is my pen.
    - japanese: これも私のペンです。
      english: This is also my pen.
    - japanese: これは私の猫です。
      english: This is my cat.
    - japanese: 先生の傘です。
      english: (It) is the teacher's umbrella.
    - japanese: あなたの名前は?
      english: Your name is?
