    Register: Standard
    使用域: 一般
  writeup: Just like in other grammar points that include the う-Verb至る 'to result in', or 'to reach a
    climax',に至ってwill indicate (A) as an extreme extent from which (B) results. Thecase marking particleに
    will mark either a verb ornounas the extent that至る is signifying as being extreme. Common translations
    include 'only when (A), did (B)', and 'going as far as to (A), (B)'.The extreme extent thatに至ってimplies
    will often be the result of something that has been left far too long in a certain state. Due to this,に至ってis
    often used in relation to criticism of a lack of action.As with many other grammar structures that
    use verbs, occasionally the formal conjunctive至り will replace the standard て-form至って.Cautionに至ってandに至ってもhave
    quite different meanings, the primary thing to be aware of is as follows.(A)に至って(B) - Only when reaching
    the extreme of (A) did (B) occur.(A)に至っても(B) - Even if reaching the extreme of (A), (B) won't occur.に至ってもwill
    be covered in its own grammar point.
