  writeup: さぞis a fairly formaladverbin Japanese that is used emphatically to highlight that the following
    statement is something that the speaker understands to be true. This is often in relation to the feelings
    or situation of another. Common translations include 'you must be very (A)', 'how (A) you must be',
    or 'I dare say that (A)'. 'I dare to say that (A)' is probably the closest to the literal meaning
    ofさぞ, as the speaker is empathizing with someone else by trying to imagine the situation from their
    point of view.Asさぞis an adverb, it will usually appear at the beginning of a sentence, modifying the
    whole phrase that follows.The phrase followingさぞwill often finish with だろう or でしょう. This highlights
    the speaker's opinion about the situation as being limited by their own knowledge.Cautionさぞcomes from
    the kanji嘸, which has two alternative readings,嘸や, and嘸かし. Both嘸や, and嘸かし are occasionally used as
    even further emphasized versions ofさぞ.Despite being almost identical in meaning, さぞかし is used more
    often than さぞや.
