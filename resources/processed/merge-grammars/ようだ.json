    "writeup": "In a similar way toみたい,ようだis used when making observations about something in Japanese. Thisauxiliary verbis used to express three primary things.たとえ - Using (A) as an example to highlight the way that (B) looks/is acting.推定- Using (A) as a reason for an assumption made about (B).例示- Presenting (A) as an example of what (B) is.ようだis usually based on direct information/experience, and shows that the speaker has high confidence in what they are saying. It may also frequently appear in its kanji form,様だ.ようだcan be used with any verb,い-Adjective,な-Adjective, or noun. However, it requires な before it when used withな-Adjectives, orのwhen used with nouns.Althoughようだandそうだare often used in similar situations,そうだshows that the speaker has a lot less confidence in their statement thanようだ. Because of this,ようだis a much better choice when stating things that are obvious/observable by anyone.Cautionようだis considerably more formal thanみたい, and is therefore less common in casual conversation.",
