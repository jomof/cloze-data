  writeup: 限りだis a structure that follows adjectives in order to indicate that something is 'extremely
    (A)', or 'as (A) as can be'. This grammar pattern is simply a mix of the noun限り, 'limit', and theauxiliary
    verbだ, or です in the case of a polite sentence. Therefore, the literal meaning is just that something
    is 'the limit of (A)', where (A) is some describable feature.限りだ will follow adjectives in theirstandard
    forms.限りだis a fairly formal grammar point that simply aims to highlight the intensity of traits as
    perceived by the speaker. As this perception is something coming from the speaker, the adjective itself
    will often be an emotion that the speaker themselves is experiencing, rather than a direct quality
    of the object, such as its color or shape. Some examples of this are as follows.嬉しい - The feeling
    of happiness, as experienced by the speaker.頼もしい - The feeling of reliability, as experienced by the
    speaker.羨ましい - The feeling of jealousy, as experienced by the speaker.寂しい - The feeling of lonliness,
    as experienced by the speaker.恥ずかしい - The feeling of embarrassment, as experienced by the speaker.心強い
    - The feeling of reassurance, as experienced by the speaker.As can be seen in all of the examples.
    The intensity of the adjective is something that will change depending on one speaker to the next,
    rather than something that the target is doing.
