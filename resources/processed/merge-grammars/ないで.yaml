  writeup: There are two primary ways in whichないでis used with verbs in Japanese. The first is to express
    'without doing (A), (B)'. The second is to request that someone 'not do (A)'. We will examine the
    first in this write-up.ないでis a combination of theauxiliary verbない, and the particleで. Due to this,でkeeps
    its standard meaning of 'with/by', in relation to 'not' doing something.Whenないでis used to express
    that '(A) has not been done before doing (B)', this is usually contrary to some kind of expectation.
    Because of this, ないで is often used to express something that may be surprising to the listener.CautionBe
    careful of the following two structures:(A)ないで(B) - Without doing (A), (B)(A)なくて(B) - Without doing
    (A), (B)Technically, these two constructions share a similar meaning. However, in modern Japaneseないでis
    used more frequently when the (B) action is being highlighted as being done without (A). On the other
    hand,なくてis used when (A) is being given as a reason for why something else was/wasn't done.
