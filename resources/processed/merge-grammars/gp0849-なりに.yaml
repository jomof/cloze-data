  writeup: When used as a noun, なり often presents an example group from which something exhibits traits
    of, regardless of whether that group is actually a good example of the trait being described. This
    use can be translated as 'for (A) do to (C) in the way of (B)'. Or more simply, 'to do its best in
    its own way', or 'to do as much as one can'. This use stems from形, meaning 'shape' or 'pattern', and
    can be thought of as meaning 'in the pattern of'.In these sentences, (A) will be a specific example
    from within a group, (B) will be representative of the whole group, and (C), will be the trait or
    behavior in question related to (B).Either of thecase marking particles に or の will come after なり,
    depending on whether なり is linked directly to a noun, or is being used adverbially.なりにandなりのmay follow
    almost any word in itsplain form, with the word it follows being the group or quality that is being
    represented.This use of なり is considered a neologism, which is a pre-existing word that has been adapted
    to have a new meaning or nuance. When used this way, なり will almost always express that (A) is not
    doing something adequately or as desired, but is doing the best it can based on the 'pattern' or 'mold'
    that it comes from.
