  writeup: み is a commonsuffixin Japanese that has the role of transforming adjectives into nouns. This
    is often translated as '(A)ness' in English, but has a few small differences.To use み, attach it to
    the stem form of eitherい-Adjectivesorな-Adjectives. The語幹(stem form) being the form with い removed
    (forい-Adjectives), or な removed (forな-Adjectives).Cautionみ's differences from ~ness are as follows.
    み is used to highlight the 'condition', or 'place' in which something exists in a constant state.
    Therefore, it will not be used to highlight varying degrees of ~ness, only innate qualities that are
    not being specifically measured.In addition to this, み is sometimes used directly as a substitute
    for味, the kanji meaning 'taste'. In these cases, み tends to describe a quality of something that can
    be sensed (such as taste or color).
