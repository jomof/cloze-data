  writeup: One of the regular functions of と in Japanese is as a quotation particle. This use is called
    引用 in Japanese, which basically translates as 'reference', or 'citation'. This way of using と can
    appear after almost any type of word (or phrase), but requires だ when used after nouns or な-Adjectives
    .と as a quotation marker will almost always be followed by a verb that shows what type of 'quote'
    it is. This can be words like 言 う, 思 う, 考 える, 聞 く, etc. However, at the end of a sentence, the verb
    will often be omitted.As with other instances of the particle と being used, this use simply expresses
    the relationship between (A) 'what was communicated', and (B) 'how it was communicated'.
  examples:
    - japanese: 彼はとても親切だと聞きました。
      english: I heard that he is very friendly.
    - japanese: メモに「私は今から学校に行きます」と書いた。
      english: I wrote, 'I am going to school now' on a note.
    - japanese: 「彼はここに来ますか」と聞いた。
      english: I asked, 'Is he coming here?' (asked)
    - japanese: 「晩ごはんを作った」と言った。
      english: I said, 'I made dinner'.
    - japanese: 「重いですか」と聞きました。
