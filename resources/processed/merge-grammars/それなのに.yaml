  writeup: Being a combination of thesubstitute nounそれ, な, and のに, the particle meaning 'although' or
    'despite',それなのにacts as a conjunction meaning 'and yet', or 'despite that', and simply refers back
    to the previous statement made, when the following statement is in contradiction to it.Due to its
    use as a conjunction,それなのにwill primarily appear at the beginning of a new sentence.Being that the
    (B) sentence is in contradiction to the (A) sentence,それなのにwill often indicate something that is unexpected,
    or was somehow unpredictable based on (A).
