  writeup: Theはparticle has two primary functions. The first is to mark the topic of a sentence, as learned
    very early in our Japanese language journey. However, the second common usage ofはis to highlight contrast
    (making a comparison). Whenはis used after a number/counter, it regularly has this comparison meaning.
    This can be translated as 'or so', or 'at least'.Beforeは, the counter is regularly followed byくらい(orぐらい).
    This just softens the statement, and further highlights the 'or so' meaning.Despite being translated
    as 'at least', the comparative meaning ofはitself is what creates the nuance of this grammar structure.
    The thing beforeはis being highlighted as an amount, while also implying that there are other amounts.
    This implication of another amount makesはsound as if it could mean 'as opposed to (B)'. So in essence,
    this grammar structure sounds like 'As for (A), as opposed to (B)', where (B) is not usually mentioned.
