  writeup: Just like the grammar pointの中で〜が一番〜, this grammar point may be used when marking one thing
    from within a group, and then further describing it. The only difference is thatの中でby itself simply
    marks something as being 'among (A)', or 'within (A)', rather than being the 'most (A)'.の中でis also
    frequently used to describe things that are happening within a place, and will translate simply as
    'in (A)', in these cases.
