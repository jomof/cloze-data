  writeup: As anadverb,割にis usually used in a similar way to 'although', 'despite', or 'comparatively'
    in English.割にmay be used at the beginning of a sentence, or after any word/phrase that it is highlighting
    as being 'comparative'. When followingな-Adjectivesor nouns, な or の will be required.割itself is anounmeaning
    'proportionate', and is primarily used as asuffix.割にmay be thought of as a direct extension of this
    use, as 'proportionately' is its closest literal meaning.Fun FactWhile割にis often thought to make comparisons
    between things, it actually only ever compares something to itself (or things within the same category).
    The 'proportion' that is then highlighted is something that is not common within the category of (A).CautionBoth割と
    and割にare quite common expressions. However,割と is used far more often in casual speech to show that
    something is 'unexpectedly (A)'. It will also frequently be used as a stand-alone expression, appearing
    directly before the word (usually an adjective) that is of a 'considerable' amount.
