  writeup: と〜と、どちらがis an expression in Japanese that is made from the following parts:と- The particle
    (x2) in its meaning of 'and'.どちら - Thepolite speechform of誰'who', and a slightly newer form of どっち
    that basically means 'which'.が- Thecase marking particleThis structure is used when the speaker is
    asking a question about whether someone will choose (A) or (B). It is only used when there are no
    more than two possible choices.As can be seen above, verbs may be used as part of this structure if
    they are nominalized withこと, orの. Additionally, the polite form does not specifically need to be used,
    and どっち may be used instead.The secondとitself is quite often omitted, as どちら (or どっち) implies that
    both (A) and (B) are part of the same structure.Fun FactAs どちら is thepolite speechform of誰, it is
    also frequently used as a polite way to ask questions about unknown people.Cautionどちらのほう(or どっちのほう)
    may also be used, but this does not really change the overall nuance. It merely puts slightly more
    emphasis on the 'direction' of the choice. This is similar to expressions like 'which one are you
    leaning towards?' in English.
