  writeup: と思いきやis an expression used in Japanese for indicating that something is not as one had thought,
    and will often be translated as 'despite having thought (A), (B)', or 'when I thought that (A), it
    was actually (B)'.と思いきやis a combination of thecase marking particleと, theconjunctive formof the う-Verb思う,思い,
    theclassical auxiliary verbき, which indicates past tense, and the classicalbinding (adverbial) particleや,
    which marks actual or rhetorical questions in the same way as か. Due to this, a more literal translation
    is 'I thought it had (A), but I guess (B)'.Despite the origin of the phrase, in modern Japaneseと思いきやis
    just thought of as an emphatic structure that highlights the speaker's surprise in relation to something
    not being as they had expected.と思いきやmay follow any word in itsstandard form.The particle か may appear
    beforeと思いきや, but this just further emphasizes the same rhetorical question, as や itself has the same
    role.CautionA past tense phrase will always appear in (B), as it is considered to be the actual situation
    which has come about, or has been realized by the speaker.
