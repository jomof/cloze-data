  writeup: たるにis a structure that indicates something that 'is (A)' in the same way as である, and will often
    be translated as '(B) in the position of (A)', or '(B) as an (A)'.たるにitself as a combination of たる,
    which is theattributive formofclassical auxiliary verbたり, and thecase marking particleに.たるにwill appear
    after anounmarking some sort of position, with a statement about that position following after. It
    may be used either positively or negatively.たるにis not as common asたるもの, which is a combination of
    たる and thenoun者, used to identify people. In these cases, (A)たる者will specifically mean 'a person in
    the position of (A)', and generally describes what is appropriate of that position. This use may be
    translated as 'for' or 'as'.Although this structure means 'to be' in the same way as である, the emphasis
    is far more on qualifications or expectations related to that position. Due to this, たる will not be
    used when simply stating that '(B) is (A)'.CautionAlthough たる does relate to the suitability of something
    being in a specific position, be careful not to confuse it with the う-Verb足る 'to be sufficient', or
    'to be worthy'.Fun Factたり itself is a contraction of thecase marking particleと and あり 'to be'. This
    can be compared to なり, which is a contraction of に and あり.
