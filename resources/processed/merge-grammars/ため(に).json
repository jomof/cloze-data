    "writeup": "ため(or為in its kanji form) is a noun in Japanese that can be translated quite closely to 'sake' in English. However, it is classified as anon-independent wordin Japanese, and must always be connected to another word which illustrates the 'sake' thatためis highlighting. Thecase marking particleに will often be added afterため, to show that (A) is a goal that something will be done to reach.Due to this,ためにcan be translated as 'for the sake of (A)', or 'in order to (A)'.To useために, attach it to the end of verb in its non-past form, or a noun follow by の.Fun FactDespite mainly being used to highlight goals, or things dictating an action,ためis also sometimes used to highlight events that have already taken place, and their results. Due to this, a more accurate translation ofため(in all of its uses) is 'in light of (A)'. This simply highlights that (A) is the primary or major event/thing that resulted in (B), or will result in (B).Whenためhighlights past events, it is often translated simply as 'due to', or 'because of'.",
