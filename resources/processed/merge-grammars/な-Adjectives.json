    "writeup": "In Japanese, the vast majority of な-Adjectives are originally nouns, and differ from nouns only in that they have their own set of conjugation rules. The dictionary form of a な-Adjective will always be followed by だ . な is only attached when describing another noun.As we can see from these examples, だ or です is required at the end of a sentence, but な will be required when using a な-Adjective to describe a noun.な-Adjectives are mostly words of foreign (Chinese/English) origin. This is why they have evolved to require unique conjugation rules.Fun FactAs a learner, it can be very difficult to identify what a な-Adjective is, compared to a regular noun. Nouns conjugate with の , while な-Adjectives conjugate with な. A very simple trick that Japanese children learn is using the adverb とても 'very'. If とても sounds natural with a word, then it is probably a な-Adjective , if it sounds unnatural, then the word is likely to be a regular noun.From this example, we can see that とても can be used to help identify な-Adjectives . Basically, this is due to adjectives being measurable 'very big', 'very small', while nouns are not measurable 'very dog', 'very boat'.",
