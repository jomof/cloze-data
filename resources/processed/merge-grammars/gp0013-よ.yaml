  writeup: よ is classified as a sentence ending particle in Japanese. In most cases, it is used to convey
    new information to the listener, or just to add a bit of emphasis. Like most sentence ending particles,
    it is simply added to the end of almost any sentence.Despite the standard use of よ being to convey
    new information, it is also very regularly paired with ね , to convey the meaning of 'right?!'. This
    more literally means something closer to 'I think (A), and I bet you think (A) too!'.CautionDid you
    notice that there is a だ after the noun, but not the い-Adjective ? This is not a unique rule for よ
    , but just one of the regular conjugation rules introduced in the lessons for い-Adjectives and な-Adjectives
    . It is also acceptable to use です よ after either type of adjective (or noun).
  examples:
    - japanese: トムは足が早いよ。
      english: Tom has fast feet. (Tom is a fast runner)
    - japanese: 私は背が高いよ。
      english: I am tall.
    - japanese: 野球は楽しいよ。
      english: Baseball is fun.
    - japanese: これはケーキだよ。
      english: This is a cake.
    - japanese: それはいいよ。
      english: That is good.
