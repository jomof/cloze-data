  writeup: とかis a word that belongs to a unique family of particles in Japanese calledlisting particles.
    As the name suggests, these particles are used for listing groups of items that share similarities.とかcan
    be used after verbs, or nouns, to express 'among other things, (A)'.When multiple things are listed,
    the last item in the list can (and often does) haveとかomitted.Cautionとかis used to list items in a non-exhaustive
    way. What this means is that the listener will assume that there are other items in the list, apart
    from what is stated directly. The speaker is just providing a few examples of a (potentially much
    larger) category.Fun FactAs we have seen,とかmay be used with verb phrases. This is in contrast toや,
    a similar grammar point that can only be used for listing nouns.
