    "writeup": "Thesuffix〜代is used for several different things. One of the most common uses is for highlighting someone's decade of age. In the same way that English says teens, twenties, and thirties. All that is required is adding代after the age (in tens), in Japanese.In addition to someone's decade of age,〜代can be used to express a chronological decade, such as the 1960's, 70's, or 80's. In these cases,年代will be used after the decade.Fun Fact代is also regularly seen when marking eras of time, or generations of people within a specific family/political position.",
