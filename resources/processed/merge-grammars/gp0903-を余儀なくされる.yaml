  writeup: を余儀なくされるis a formal grammar pattern in Japanese that is usually translated as 'to be forced
    to (A)'. Its component parts are theadverbial particleを, the noun余儀'another method', theconjunctive
    formof the い-Adjective ない, なく, and the passive form of する, される. In this way, it literally means 'to
    not be given another way than to (A)'.を余儀なくされるwill be seen following an (A) noun, where (A) is the
    thing that is unavoidable.In most cases, the subject of sentences that useを余儀なくされるwill be a person,
    or something that is representative of people, such as a company. However, there are exceptions to
    this.CautionBothを余儀なくされる'to be forced to do' andを余儀なくさせる'to force to do' are variations of the same
    grammar structure.を余儀なくさせるwill be taught in a different lesson.Fun FactDespite余儀and ない being separate
    words,余儀なく is often thought of simply as a single word that means 'unavoidably', or 'inevitably'.
