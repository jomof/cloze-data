  writeup: Originally coming from the う-Verb給う 'to give', or 'to bestow', the imperative formたまえmay be
    seen attached to the ます-stem of verbs, in order to create a light order. It is often translated simply
    as 'please do (A)'.Despite this,たまえis a structure that is only used to someone of lower status than
    the speaker, and primarily only by men. This 'lower status relationship' is usually one that is obvious
    between both the speaker and the listener, such as a boss and subordinate.Fun-fact - In the past,
    たまえ was sometimes used to ask for favors or for wishes to be granted in prayers. However, this use
    will primarily only be seen in books in the modern era.
