  writeup: と is a particle that is often thought of as meaning 'and' in English, which is usually how
    it can be translated. In a broader sense, と simply shows that there is a relationship of 'compilation'
    between (A) and (B). That relationship could be existing together (translated as ' and '), or performing
    an action together (translated as ' with ').In this case, we will focus on the 'and' translation.
    A full description of と as 'with' can be found here .と is required after every noun that it is grouped
    with. However, the last と in a sentence will often be omitted, if there are several.In this example,
    we can see that the last noun in the group (pencil) does not require the particle と , although it
    is considered more correct to have it. In conversation, the last と will almost always be omitted.
