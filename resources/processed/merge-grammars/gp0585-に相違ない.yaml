  writeup: In a similar fashion to に違いない,に相違ないis a structure that firmly states that something is 'without
    a doubt (A)', or that there is 'no mistaking (A)'. It may be used to strengthen one's own opinions,
    or to strongly agree with the opinion of another. Although相違may be used by itself meaning 'to differ',
    or 'to have a discrepancy',相違ない is considered as a set い-Adjective. When combined with ない, the literal
    meaning is just 'there is no discrepancy in (A)'.に相違ない may be used with verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives
    and nouns.に相違ない will often follow から, highlighting that there is no mistaking the 'cause' of (A).Caution
    - This grammar structure is very formal, with に違いない almost always being used in its place.
