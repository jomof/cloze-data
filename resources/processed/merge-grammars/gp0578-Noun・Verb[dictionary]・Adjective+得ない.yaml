  writeup: 得る is a る-Verb that has the meaning of 'to gain' or 'to acquire'. When attached to theconjunctive
    formof verbs, it takes on the nuance of 'for (A) to be possible', or 'able to (A)'. In addition to
    this, when得るis combined with ない, that nuance switches to 'unable to (A)', or 'cannot (A)'.Compared
    to できない, meaning that the potential to do something does not exist,得ない means something closer to 'there
    is no possibility that (A) can be done', or 'the possibility to do (A) has not been gained'.Caution
    -得る may be seen as either える or うる. The primary difference between the two being that うる is a relatively
    old form that is often seen only in literature, and almost never spoken. Despite this, うる is never
    used in the negative form with ない.Fun-fact -得るis far more formal/bookish than できる. However, there
    are several set phrases that are very common in daily speech that use this particular grammar point,
    such as あり得る'possible', and あり得ない 'impossible'.
