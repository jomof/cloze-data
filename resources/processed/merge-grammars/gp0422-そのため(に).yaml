  writeup: そのためにis a frequently usedconjunctionin Japanese that utilizesその, thenounため 'reason' (occasionally
    seen as為), and thecase marking particleに.そのためにis most commonly translated as 'for that reason', or
    'to that end'.そのためにwill be used at the beginning of a new sentence, to highlight something that will
    be done/occur due to the circumstances/goal of something in the first sentence.にis often omitted.Cautionため
    is very similar to 'sake' in English, and tends to be used far more frequently when referring to goals/positive
    outcomes, than it is for negative outcomes. However, it may still occasionally be used in negative
    circumstances, to highlight their (unfortunate) result.Fun Fact為is an exceptionally flexible kanji
    in Japanese. In addition to ため it is occasionally used forする'to do', なる 'to become', なす 'to bring
    about', and つくる 'to make'. The kanji itself means 'to put (something) to use', with heavy emphasis
    on whatever new state/result will be arrived at afterwards. This meaning can be seen reflected in
    all of為's readings.
