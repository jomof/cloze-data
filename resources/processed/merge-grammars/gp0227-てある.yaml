  writeup: Like 'verb+ている', 'verb+てある' is a structure that will convey an ongoing state. However, that
    is where the similarities stop.てあるmay only be used with transitive verbs, and highlights the object
    itself as being the subject of the sentence (rather than the initial person/thing that performed the
    action).Becauseあるis being used, it highlights the object as being inanimate (or unable to undo the
    action that was performed on it). Due to this,てあるis regularly translated as 'to be left (A)', or 'to
    remain (A)', where (A) is the original verb that somebody performed on the object.がmay mark the object
    in these sentences when the action itself involves some kind of preparation. Examples are as follows:予約-
    Reservation (requires time investment to reserve)準備- Preparation (requires time investment to prepare)録音-
    Recording (requires time investment to make the recording)In situations that involve no real preparation
    (opening a door, for example),をwill be preferred when marking the object.
