    "writeup": "ものをis a grammar point that functions in a similar way to のに in that it will express that (A) is something that was desired, despite (B) being the actual result. However, it is primarily used when the speaker is trying to convey their displeasure at the result of (B), due to (A) being something that by all means should have happened.ものをwill be translated as 'if only (A)', or '(A), but (B)'. Despite being a construction of もの and theadverbial particleを,ものをis often considered as a standaloneconjunction particle. It can be seen following verbs or い-Adjectives in theirstandard form, or な-Adjectives followed by な.As can be seen in the above examples,ものをis almost always preceded by hypothetical structures such as ば at some point leading up to its use.Cautionものをwill often be seen at the end of sentences, with what would have come after it being left unspoken. In these cases, the important information is still there, as the (A) part of the sentence will always highlight what the ideal result was. Because of this, it can be safely assumed that the speaker is just frustrated that (A) didn't happen.Fun FactTheadverbial particleを is often used this way in Japanese, where no specific action is linked to it. In these situations it usually just indicates an ideal or goal to which the method of achieving it (the verb that would usually be attached to を) is omitted. ものを can be thought of as an extension of this in literally meaning 'to that which was (A)', with 'I wish it had happened' being unsaid.",
