  writeup: がいい is a combination of the case-marking particle が, and the い-Adjective いい. It is used in
    a way that almost sounds like an order from someone in a higher position, to someone in a lower position.
    Standard translations will include 'you shall (A)', or 'you should (A)'. However, the more literal
    translation is 'to (A) would be good'.(A) will be the dictionary form of a verb. がいい will then directly
    follow (A).In many cases, the person using がいい is in a very high position, or perceives themselves
    to be in a very high position such as a king, emperor, wise wizard, or something similar. Due to this,
    がいい is rarely used in real life, and sounds very magnanimous, or even pompous.Additionally, as いい
    is being used in a pompous way, the more literary 良 い will frequently be used in its place.Fun FactVerb+がいい
    may be thought of as a far stronger equivalent of た 方 がいい 'you should (A)', except that it will only
    ever be used by those that consider their own suggestion as the only correct course of action.
