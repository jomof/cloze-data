  writeup: も〜ば〜もis a construction in Japanese which presents aspects of something to which both (A) and
    (B) are true. も will be connected to a noun, before the hypothetical marking particle ば will appear
    following a verb, い-Adjective, な-Adjective, or noun. In the case of nouns and な-Adjectives, なら or
    ならば will be used.In this way,も〜ば〜もjust highlights that 'If (A) is true, then so is (B)'. This usually
    just emphasizes that (A) and (B) are things that go together hand-in-hand, with one trait or characteristic
    always existing if the other does. Standard translations include 'both (A) and (B) are (C)', or 'the
    trait of (C), is in (A) and (B) as well'.CautionWithも〜ば〜も, both traits must be things that share some
    sort of mutual connection. This means that both (A) and (B) will either be positive, neutral, or negative,
    but never a mixture of any one.
