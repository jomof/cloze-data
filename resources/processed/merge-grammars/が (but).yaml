  writeup: As a particle, が has several different uses in Japanese. However, each of these different uses
    share a common theme. That theme expresses 'highlighting (A) as important, (B)'. In this use, が comes
    across as 'but', or 'however' in English.This nuance of が is used directly after any form of verb
    or い-Adjective , but requires one of the conjugations of だ or です before it when used with a noun or
    な-Adjective .From these examples, we can see that が is simply highlighting that 'while (A) is important,
    there is extra information'. が with the meaning of 'but' is considered to be very formal, this is
    due to it sounding quite direct in asserting that there is extra information.CautionSometimes a statement
    will end with が . In these cases it just means that more information exists, but it is obvious, so
    it does not need to be said.
  examples:
    - japanese: まあ、綺麗ですが。
      english: Well, it is pretty, but… (I still don't like it)
    - japanese: 難しいですが、頑張ります。
      english: It is difficult, but I will do my best.
    - japanese: 寒いですが、外へ行きます。
      english: It's cold, but I will go outside.

  writeup: '## 1. が2, like ''but'' in English, combines two sentences which express contrastive ideas.
    However, が is much weaker than ''but'' in that it is sometimes used simply to combine two sentences
    for stylistic reasons even if those two sentences do not represent contrastive ideas. For example,
    the が in (1) is used simply as a transition word to connect two sentences.'
  formation: "## \n\n- S1がS2\n- 太郎は泳いだが次郎は泳がなかった。\n- Taro swam but Jiro didn't swim."
