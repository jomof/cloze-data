    "writeup": "てご覧is anhonorific languageexpression in Japanese that is used in a similar way toなさい. It is usually translated as 'please try to (A)', where (A) is the verb that ご覧is connected to, through the use of theconjunction particleて.However, despite being translated as 'please try to (A)', the literal meaning of覧is 'to look', or 'to peruse' (to look at one's own leisure, without needing to rush). Due to this, てごらん can be thought of as being quite similar toてみる'to try', but with the added emphasis of 'try as you like, when it suits you'.CautionAs ご覧ishonorific language, it cannot be used to refer to your own actions, or things that you will 'try'. It will only ever be used to make suggestions to other people about what they should try.CautionSometimes ごらん andなさいwill be paired together. This slightly increases the strength of the suggestion, and may be perceived as a very light command. Because of this, ごらんなさい is primarily used by superiors/elders, when requesting that a subordinate/younger person try something.",
