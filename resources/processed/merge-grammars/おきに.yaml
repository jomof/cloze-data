  writeup: 置きに  is  a combination of置き, asuffixmeaning 'opening' or 'interval', and thecase marking particleに.
    Primarily written without kanji, it is an expression used to show that something happens 'every (A)',
    or 'at intervals of (A)'.The difference between something being interpreted as 'every', or 'at intervals
    of' can be tricky though, so we'll look at both.Due toおきにbeing asuffix, it will be attached to the
    end of numbers, counters, or any 'space' that it is highlighting as being an 'opening' or 'interval'.Looking
    at these sentences, we can see that the 'interval' is a bit difficult to understand even in English.
    However, the easier way to think ofおきにin this sense is 'leaving a space of (A), (B)'. So if we say
    'leaving a space of two days, (B)', it becomes a bit clearer that something is happening during the
    third day.CautionIt is very common to getごとにandおきにmixed up. The former literally means 'every'. However,
    the latter having the meaning of 'at intervals' makes things confusing.おきにitself will only mean 'every'
    sometimes. Let's look at some examples of when these two expressions overlap in meaning, and when
    they do not.Large time frames or distances - Onlyごとにwill be used to express 'every'. It makes sense
    to ask 'at what point' during a day, a week, or a month. Due to this, onlyおきにwill mean 'after the
    interval of (A)', whileごとにmeans 'every'.Small time frames or distances - Bothごとにandおきにmay be used
    to express 'every'. It doesn't make sense to care about 'at what point' during seconds, minutes, or
    hours. Here, becauseおきにpoints at the interval, it will mean 'every interval of one second' etc, because
    nobody is going to ask 'when did (B) happen during the next second', so the space is just assumed
    to be 'one second'.In summary,おきにwill mean 'every (A)' for seconds, minutes, hours, millimeters, centimeters,
    and kilometers. But it will mean 'with spaces of' for almost anything bigger than that. This is not
    an exception to the rule, it is just a change of focus as spaces get larger. We can just remember
    thatおきにalways has one job. It highlights that (B) occurs after or outside of (A). Whileごとにhighlights
    (B) happening within (A).一秒おきに- The space is 'one second', so ifおきにpoints to the beginning of the
    next second, the space is still only 'one second'. Becauseおきにdoesn't care about where (B) happens
    within that next second, we assume straight away.五年おきに- The space is 'five years', so ifおきにpoints
    to the beginning of the next year, the space becomes 'six years', because we are going to want to
    know where (B) happens within that next year. It would be strange to assume someone is waiting for
    New Year of the sixth year to do something instantly.Fun FactThis is a topic that native speakers
    frequently get wrong themselves, so don't worry if it takes a while to understand! If you are unsure
    about which one to use, think of置きに as 'leaving intervals of (A), (B)' for most purposes.一時間tends
    to be the upper limit of time that most people disagree about whether the meaning is 'every hour',
    or 'every second hour'. This makes sense, as the time frame is short, but still sort of long, so whether
    someone takes it as the beginning of the hour or some point during that hour being the important information,
    their opinions may differ. Remember though,おきにitself only ever points to the beginning of the space
    after (A), it doesn't care when/where (B) happens afterward.
