  writeup: だけはis another one of the many grammar patterns in Japanese that includes the particle だけ, meaning
    'just' or 'only'. In this particular structure, だけ pairs with は, and presents a specific verb as the
    topic to indicate that it is being done 'as much as one can'. The same verb will be repeated both
    before and afterだけは, with the one coming second usually appearing in its past-tense or ている form.Imagining
    that the target verb was食べる 'to eat', the literal translation of something like食べるだけは食べた would be
    'I ate just what I could eat'. Because this pattern frequently discusses possibilities, it is also
    very common for the first verb to be in the potential れる or られる form.Caution - It is also relatively
    common to see する omitted following the first verb, and only being used afterだけは. In this kind of pattern,
    the target verb itself will not usually be repeated afterだけは.
