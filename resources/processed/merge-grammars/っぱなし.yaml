    formof verbs, it is used to indicate that something has been 'left' in a certain state.っぱなしis almost
    exclusively used negatively.Fun FactAlthough放す means 'to let loose',っぱなしconveys a feeling that is
    closer to 'being unchecked'. This meansっぱなしcan be used to convey that 'the act of (A)' is continuing
    without anyone there to stop it, or that the 'state of (A)' is continuing without anyone there to
    stop it. Which meaning is conveyed will depend mostly on the (A) verb.
