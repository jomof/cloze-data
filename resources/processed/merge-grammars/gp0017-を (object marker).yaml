  writeup: In Japanese, を is a particle that marks the object of an action. This means that the subject
    (the person or thing performing an action) is performing that action with the object being the goal/target
    of the action. In most cases, whatever を is attached to will not actually be 'doing' anything, but
    will instead have something being done to it.In these sentences, を is marking the thing that is having
    an action performed 'on' it. This is how the Japanese language views the ' object '. However, unlike
    English, an object can also be a place in which an action is performed 'through', if the goal of that
    action is based in that location itself.In these sentences, を is marking the place 'through' which
    the action is taking place. This use of を highlights that the place itself is what is being interacted
    with (running/walking requires interaction with the ground, so the ground/place is the object).
