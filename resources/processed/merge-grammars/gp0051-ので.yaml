  writeup: ので is a Japanese grammar structure called a conjunction particle. This means that it connects
    two parts of a sentence 'logically'. The connection that ので makes between (A), and (B), is similar
    to から , meaning that it is often translated as 'because', or 'since'.When used after な-Adjectives
    or nouns, な must precede ので .When used as 'since', ので puts emphasis on the sentence as a whole, or
    on the effects caused. It then examines those reasons objectively (in a way that is based on facts,
    rather than feelings or opinions). から tends to be more subjective, and can sound much more vague when
    used as 'because'.We can see here that から is not quite as strong as ので . This relates back to the
    base meaning of から being ' from ', rather than ' because '.Cautionので can sometimes be seen as んで ,
    which is a more casual variation. Also, unlike many grammar points that connect to verbs, ので may be
    used with the ます form. This is something that is unique to conjunction particles.
