  writeup: Although a combination of いつ 'when', の,間'interval', に, and か;いつの間にかis a set expression that
    is used as a stand-alone adverb to mean 'suddenly', or 'without noticing'. Literally, it just highlights
    an unknown interval within which something occurred, as seen by the question marking particle, か.Fun-fact
    - Coming mainly from the inclusion か, this grammar pattern often carries the nuance of surprise. When
    you want to convey the same feeling without the nuance of surprise,あっという間にmay be used instead. This
    is a similar expression which literally means 'in the time it takes to say あっ'.
