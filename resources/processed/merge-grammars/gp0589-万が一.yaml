  writeup: 万が一, or sometimes simply万一is a grammar pattern that literally means '1 in 10000'. It is used
    in a similar way to phrases such as 'in the unlikely event of (A)', or 'just in case (A)' in English,
    and will usually highlight some measure against (A), or what will happen as a result of (A) in the
    latter half of the sentence.万が一is primarily used adverbially, so will often come at the beginning
    of sentences.Fun-fact -万が一is considered slightly stronger than万一, but万が一is far more common due to
    it being easier to pronounce.
