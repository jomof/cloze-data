  writeup: As mentioned in our ずに lesson, ず is anauxiliary verbthat is not commonly used in modern Japanese,
    except for in set expressions. It has the equivalent role of ない, in expressing that something 'has
    not', or 'will not' happen. Thecase marking particleにis then combined with theadverbial particleは,
    and the negative-potential form of いる, いられない.ずにはいられないmay be translated as 'cannot help doing (A)',
    or 'cannot resist doing (A)'.ずにはいられないwill be attached to theindeterminate formof verbs. This is the
    same stem form as ない uses.Althoughずにはいられないis often translated as 'cannot resist (A)', the literal
    meaning is simply 'cannot be without (A)'.CautionAs the modernindeterminate formofするhas several different
    forms, care will need to be taken when conjugatingするverbs. While ない joins with し to create しない, ず
    will join with せ to create せず.
