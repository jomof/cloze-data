  writeup: になる (with な-Adjectives ), or くなる (with い-Adjectives ) is an expression used in Japanese to
    show that something is 'becoming (A)'. It can be used with any form of なる , to highlight that something
    will become (non-past), is becoming (continuous), or has become (past). It can even be used with negative
    forms, to show that something 'will not become (A)'.In the example with the tea getting cold, we can
    see how ている sometimes highlights something that exists in an ongoing state, rather than changing any
    further. In other words, 'the tea has gotten cold, and remains to be cold'.Additionally, the adjective
    いい 'good' is an exception to the regular conjugation rules for い-Adjectives , and will conjugate as
    よくなる, not いくなる.

    - japanese: 早くなる。
      english: To become fast.
    - japanese: よくなる。
      english: To become better.
