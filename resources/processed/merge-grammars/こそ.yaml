  writeup: こそis anadverbial particlein Japanese that primarily replaces eitherをor が. Its main role is
    to highlight the preceding noun (or noun phrase) as being the the most important piece of information
    in relation to the rest of the sentence. In English, this is an effect that is primarily achieved
    through things like bold text, underlining, or emphasizing a particular word in speech. If we were
    to make a direct comparison to an English statement, then things like 'precisely because it's (A)',
    or 'rather it is due to (A)', are quite similar toこそ's function.こそcan be used directly after any noun
    that would usually take theを, or が particles, so long as that particular piece of information needs
    to be emphasized.CautionThe reason thatこそis able to replace が, but not は, is due to the fact that
    が primarily highlights specific pieces of information, while は nominates general topics. This means
    that they have completely opposite functions. To make things easier, the three particles can be thought
    of in the following way:は- Weakly highlights specific information.が- Strongly highlights specific
    information.こそ- Very strongly highlights specific information.Fun Factこそis often used after names
    or pronouns, as a way to reply to thanks/apologies. In these situations, it expresses that the speaker
    feels equally (or more) obliged to say what was just said to them by someone else.
