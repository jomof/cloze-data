  writeup: One of the most common ways to convey that something is 'like' something else in casual conversation,
    is through the use ofそんな,こんな,あんな, orどんな(when asking a question). These are not officially words themselves,
    but are abbreviations that come fromそのような,このような,あのような, andどのような.To use this casual expression, simply
    say it directly before the noun that you are describing, or enquiring about.Because these abbreviations
    originally come from a longer (more formal) variation, that form may also be used in situations where
    you would like to sound a little bit more polite.
