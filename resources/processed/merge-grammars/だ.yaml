  writeup: For the most part, だ is the equivalent of 'is' in English. Its role is to strongly express
    determination or assertion. It is a casual grammar structure, which means that you won't see it in
    polite sentences.Technically, だ is an auxiliary verb , a group of words that attach themselves to
    other words to give them meaning. です has the same role as だ , but です is the one that will be used
    in polite sentences, and is also one of the first Japanese grammar patterns many people are exposed
    to.だ will always follow nouns, or words that behave like nouns, such as な-Adjectives .Cautionだ should
    never be attached to the end of い-Adjectives . In these cases, it is considered more correct to attach
    a polite equivalent, like です .CautionWhile だ is often thought of as the 'casual form' of です , that
    is actually not entirely true. です is a polite speech word. The official 'formal version' of だ is である
    . We will learn this grammar point a bit later. である can often be seen in articles, and formal writing,
    while です is more common in polite speech .
