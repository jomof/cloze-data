    "writeup": "As mentioned briefly in theございますlesson,でございますis a structure which can be used as a replacement forであります, the polite form ofである(which itself is the formal equivalent ofだ). Bothですandでございますare consideredpolite speech. However,でございますis the more polite of the two. Let's take a look at a few examples.でござるmay also be seen, as it is the base form ofで+ございますa (special-class) verb. However, in modern Japanese, this is primarily restricted to historical dramas, or characters that have a somewhat 'quirky' personality.Fun FactUsingでございますto introduce yourself is considered quite polite, however, when referring to other people,いらっしゃる'to be' is preferred, ashonorific languageis more respectful thanpolite speech.",
