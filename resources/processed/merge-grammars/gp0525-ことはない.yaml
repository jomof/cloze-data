  writeup: ことはないis an expression that has two primary purposes in Japanese. To convey that there is 'no
    need for (A)', or that '(A) never happens'. In these cases, (A) is a verb that will appear directly
    before こと.ことはないis often used to reassure someone that something will not come to pass.In this expression,
    theadverbial particleは is working to present (A) as the extent (a regular role of adverbial particles),
    while the形容詞ない negates that extent. This negation is up to interpretation, with the literal meaning
    simply being 'There is no (A)'.CautionThis structure is very different to たことがない, which presents a
    single instance of something not having happened. As opposed to thecase marking particleが, は presents
    the verb/verb-phrase as a topic itself in non-past form, highlighting its non-existence. Due to this,ことはないcan
    imply that (A) is unthinkable, or even impossible.
