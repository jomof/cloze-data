  writeup: に照らしてis an expression based on the standard meaning of the う-Verb照らす 'to illuminate', and is
    primarily used comparatively in a similar way to 'in light of' in English. This comparative meaning
    aims to illustrate (B) from the perspective of (A), and usually refers to situations, level of experience,
    or something similar.To use this structure, attach the case-marking particle に to the end of a noun,
    then follow it with照らして. If a second noun will be modified directly, then照らした will be used instead.Keep
    in mind that the に in this structure is marking (A) as the 'doer' of照らす 'to illuminate', as it is
    a transitive verb. This means that the structure has a more literal translation of '(B) as reflected
    by (A)'. This can also be thought of as 'as made clear by (A), (B)', 'as made evident by (A), (B)'.
    (B) will almost always be a judgment that is logically based on (A).
