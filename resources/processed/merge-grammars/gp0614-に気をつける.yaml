  writeup: Another of the large number of collocations in Japanese based on気'attention', or 'focus', is気を付ける.
    This is just a combination of the noun気, を, and the る-Verb付ける 'to adhere', or 'to attach'.気を付けるprimarily
    follows (A) に. This marks (A) as something that the speaker is 'adhering' their attention to, and
    translates as 'to pay attention to (A)', 'to be careful of (A)', or 'to watch out for (A)'.This grammar
    pattern is used after nouns or noun-like phrases, indicating the thing that is being warned about,
    or that the speaker themselves is being cautious of.Most often,気を付けるwill be used to warn about possible
    errors that could be made, mistakes, or simply the loss of focus. Due to this, it frequently follows
    negative verbs as ないよう, highlighting that something should be done in a 'manner' that doesn't result
    in (A).
