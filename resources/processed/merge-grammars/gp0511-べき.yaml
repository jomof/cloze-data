  writeup: Theauxiliary verbべき, being theattributive formof べし, is a structure in Japanese that is often
    paired with verbs to express that something 'ought to be done'. It implies some sort of moral obligation,
    or that (A) is the only reasonable course of action. This comes from the kanji可き, which carries the
    meaning of being something 'permissible' (indicating that any other action would not be acceptable).べきwill
    be paired with the plain (non-past) form of a verb, before being followed by eitherだ, or another noun.べきis
    also sometimes translated as 'must do (A)', or 'should do (A)' but it is important to remember that
    it will always have the nuance of being the only 'permissible' choice, and is therefore very strong.CautionIt
    is important to note that the verb appearing withべきcannot be in past tense, and you will need to useだったorでしたafterべき,
    if you would like to say that something 'ought to have been done' in the past.Fun FactIn modern Japanese,
    there are only 18auxiliary verbs, of whichべきis not one. べし (the standard form) is considered to be
    aclassical auxiliary verb. Due to this,べき(and べし) are often referred to asclassical auxiliary verbs.Fun
    FactThe combination ofするandべきis a rare grammatical exception in Japanese, in which two forms are both
    considered equally correct. Due to this, either するべき, or すべき may be used.
