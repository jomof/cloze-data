  writeup: When used after verbs,気often indicates either the will or desire to do that particular action.
    This use of気is often interpreted as 'to feel like doing (A)' in English. More literally,気may be translated
    as 'mind', as is similar to the way phrases like 'to have half a mind to (A)' in English, indicating
    that something is either positively or negatively drawing the speaker's attention toward doing (or
    avoiding) the action of (A).As気itself is a noun expressing the 'mind' or 'intention' to do (A), it
    may be followed by a variety of different verbs indicating an array of slightly unique nuances. Common
    patterns are気がある 'to have the feeling of (A)',気がない 'to not have the feeling of (A)',気がする 'to feel
    like (A)',気がしない 'to not feel like (A)',気が出る 'for the feeling of (A) to come about', and気が出ない 'for
    the feeling of (A) to not come about'.
