  writeup: というのは is a phrase that combines the case marking particle と,  the う - Verb 言 う,  and the nominalizing
    particle combination のは. Together, they are usually translated as 'the ~ known as ~ is ~', or 'the
    ~ called ~ is ~'. Sometimes, it can even simply be '~ means ~'. In essence, というのは is just a way to
    turn an entire phrase into a noun, before explaining that noun further. This explanation of (A) will
    either be to give a definition of it, or to give a reason for it.To use というのは , attach it to the end
    of a phrase that you would like to indicate as being something that will be explained further '(A)',
    and then follow it with your definition/reason, '(B)'.CautionUnlike というのは, which is mainly used to
    strongly present facts, or highlight points of discussion, replacement of は with the adverbial particle
    も can be used either as a rebuttal or as an extension of the original statement. This is when someone
    wants to show that (B) has equal weight when compared to (A). It may also be used to give the reason
    or cause for (A).Cautionというのは is sometimes used at the beginning of a new sentence, when the speaker
    wants to add extra information about what has already been said. In these situations, the translation
    is similar to 'what I mean to say is ~', or 'because of that, ~'.Cautionというのは is regularly abbreviated
    as とは, or って. This can be a little bit hard to identify in casual speech, but the '(B) explains (A)'
    concept will still almost always apply, so should be identified that way.
