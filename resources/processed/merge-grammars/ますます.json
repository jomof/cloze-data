    "writeup": "When using theadverbますます, it will have the meaning of 'increasingly', 'more and more', or even 'to keep (A)ing'. It is used to emphasize continuous trends, and will regularly be seen at the beginning of a sentence.Occasionally, the kanji form益々will be used. This will not change the nuance at all. The kanji益simply means 'gain'.Fun FactDespite sometimes being seen as益々, this expression originally comes from the stacking of増す, a う - Verb meaning 'to increase'. Due to this, ますます is most often used to highlight verbs that indicate some sort of change, or with adjectives that can increase in intensity.Cautionますますis sometimes translated as 'less and less', but this situation is still actually considered as 'increasing' (increasingly negative).",
