    "writeup": "なくてもいいis simply the opposite ofてもいい, and highlights that it is 'ok even if (A) is not done'. This usually comes across as being quite polite, and sounds like 'don't worry about doing (A)' in English.なくてもいいis a combination of theauxiliary verbない in its conjunction form, withてもいい.In order to make this phrase sound even more casual, theadverbial particleもmay be omitted. This does not change the nuance at all, but will sound a bit more friendly (when used with people that you know well).",
