  writeup: ともなくandともなしにare structures used to indicate that (A) was being done absentmindedly when (B)
    happened. It will be translated as 'unconsciously (A) when (B)', or 'without paying attention to (A),
    (B)'.This pattern is a combination of the case-marking particle と, theadverbial particleも, and theconjunctive
    formof the い-Adjective ない. It will be seen after thedictionary formof verbs, and can be thought of
    as literally meaning something similar to 'even while not intending to (B), while (A), (B)'.ともなしにis
    similar, but pairs the noun なし 'without' with に, instead of using the conjugative form of ない.ともなくandともなしにwill
    often be seen in sentences that use たら. This puts emphasis on the specific time that something happened
    while performing another action absentmindedly. Despite translating this way, the action that precedesともなくitself
    will be intentional, but the thing that comes about as a result of performing that action will not
    be what the doer was aiming to achieve.
