  writeup: 予定だis an expression that functions very similarly toつもりだ'to intend to do'. The primary difference
    being that予定is a 'plan', rather than an 'intention'. Due to this,予定is used far more frequently for
    things that you have formal plans to do (like meeting a friend for lunch).To use予定, just attach it
    to the non-past form of a verb, or to a noun (after insertingの).CautionIfだorですis not added after予定,
    it will imply that予定is simply modifying the verb/noun that comes before it, rather than being a standalone
    'plan'. This is similar to the difference between saying something like 'I have plans to eat with
    a friend' (natural), vs 'I have an eating with a friend plan' (unnatural).
