  writeup: 嫌い, meaning 'to dislike', is one of the very commonな-Adjectivesin Japanese that is used in
    many different expressions. Allな-Adjectivesbehave similarly to verbs, in that their form changes depending
    on what comes after them.For 嫌い , it will be followed by either な , when acting as an adjective, だ
    , or the more polite です , when acting as a noun. This distinction is made depending on whether it
    is linked to another noun, or is independent.In the example with だ , 嫌い is expressing that the thing
    is 'dislikable' (assertion). However, in the example with な , 嫌い is expressing 'being disliked' as
    a quality of the noun it is attached to.In the same way that 好き can often be partnered with 大 to mean
    'love', 嫌い can often be partnered with 大 to mean 'hate'.CautionDespite ending in い, 嫌い is one of the
    few words that is actually a な-Adjective , and needs to be memorized.
