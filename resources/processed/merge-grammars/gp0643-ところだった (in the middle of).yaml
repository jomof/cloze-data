  writeup: When combined with the dictionary form of verbs,ところだったwill indicate that something was about
    to happen, and will regularly be translated as 'was just about to do (A)', or 'was in the middle of
    (A)'. In many cases,ところだったwill indicate either a positive or negative result that came about from
    'not doing (A)'.As this grammar pattern is a combination of ところ 'place', and the past tense of だ,
    だった; it will put emphasis of 'having been in the place or situation of (A)', before something happened
    that caused the expected result to change.In cases where a positive result was narrowly missed out
    on, のに will often appear directly after ところだった. This can be interpreted as 'despite almost doing (A),
    (B)'.
