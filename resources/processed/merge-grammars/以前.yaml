  writeup: When used as a suffix, the noun以前‘preceding’, or ‘prior to’ will indicate that a topic is being
    brought forward as not even fulfilling the minimum requirements of (A), and therefore is expected
    to be reached before that minimum. Often, this will come across as ‘before even (A)’ in English, and
    is used to criticize something that is thoughtless or irresponsible.以前will appear directly after another
    nouns, thedictionary formof verbs, い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives. In most cases,以前will be followed
    by either thecase-marking particleに or の, depending on whether it is being linked to a subsequent
    verb or noun.The word以前itself is usually reserved for highlighting larger distances in the past than前‘before’
    by itself, and can therefore simply be thought of as an emphatic version of前. This emphasis is often
    what gives rise to the tone of criticism. As it is stating that ‘way before (A), (B)’, or ‘long before
    you even think of (A), (B)’.
