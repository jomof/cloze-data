  writeup: そういえばis a hypothetical structure in Japanese consisting of the adverb そう 'like that', and the
    ば conjunctive form of the う-Verb言う 'to say'. Common translations include 'speaking of which', 'by
    the way', and 'come to think of it'. These translations are actually very close to the literal translation
    of 'if saying that' in that they all refer back to the previous statement as being a trigger for bringing
    up a topic that the speaker wants to discuss.そういえばwill primarily appear at the beginning of sentences,
    before the speaker will then bring up the topic that they were reminded of.Caution - Due toそういえばrefering
    to something that has already been brought up over the course of a conversation, it will not be used
    to move on to completely unrelated topics in the same way that phrases like 'by the way' are used
    in English.Fun-fact -そういえばis very similar in the way it is used to といえば, with そう simply replacing
    the direct quotation of と. Many textbooks will list both as a single grammar point, despite そういえば
    itself basically being a set phrase.
