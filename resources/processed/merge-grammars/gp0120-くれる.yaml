  writeup: くれる is generally taught as part of a set of 3 verbs that are regularly used for giving and
    receiving in Japanese. These verbs are くれる , あげる , and もらう . くれる means 'to give' (to you, or someone
    that is part of your 'in' group).With くれる and あげる , they both function in the regular way you would
    expect (regarding particles). This means that が will always mark the giver (the person performing
    the action), and に will mark the recipient (the person that is the 'destination' of the thing that
    is given). This means that を will be used to mark the 'object' that is given, as is usually the case.The
    giver/recipient are often omitted from sentences with くれる , as one/both are usually obvious from context,
    or the sentence may be focussing on the object.As can be seen here, the same nuance is kept, even
    when things are omitted.Fun FactWhat someone considers their 'in' group will be different for each
    person, but usually consists of members of your family, clubs that you are in, or something similar
    that has a 'group' atmosphere (that you are a part of).The giver will always be someone that is more
    distant than the people that are in the 'group'.CautionWhen we want to say that we (or someone else)
    gave something to someone that is not in our 'in' group, we will need to use あげる instead.
