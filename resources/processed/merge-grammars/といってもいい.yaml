  writeup: と言ってもいいis a common expression in Japanese which literally means 'even if you say (A), it is
    good/ok'. This is translated more naturally as 'you could say (A)', or 'you might say (A)'.As theとat
    the beginning of the phrase is the 'quotation' use of theとparticle,と言ってもいいmay be used after almost
    any statement that the speaker wants to quote.Fun FactMost grammatical structures in Japanese that
    use言う will often appear without kanji. This is simply to make them easier to recognize as a grammar
    pattern, rather than a standard word in a sentence. This is also true for patterns that include行く,
    or来る.
