  writeup: When theadverbial particleか is combined with と, the う-Verb思う, and either of the hypothetical
    markers たら or と, it forms a compound that is used to illustrate uncertainty about whether (A) has
    been finalized or not. In most cases, this translates as '(A), then again (B)', 'just when I thought
    (A), (B)', or 'no sooner than (A), (B)'. Literally, the meaning is close to 'before (A) could even
    be confirmed as having happened, (B)'.かと思うとandかと思ったらwill regularly appear after verbs in either their
    dictionary or past-tense forms.Alternatively, this structure may also be seen following nouns, especially
    when the meaning is focused on the speaker's feelings about (A).Either なの (or の when used with verbs)
    may appear between the target phrase andかと思ったらwhen the (B) phrase includes the speaker's feelings.Caution
    - Occasionally, か may be omitted from this phrase, leaving onlyと思うとandと思ったら. Although the meaning
    is exactly the same, omission of the か will make the expression sound softer.
