  writeup: '## 1. Verbますに, meaning ''to do something'', can be used only with verbs of motion, (i.e.,
    verbs which express a movement from one place to another), such as 行く ''go'', 来る ''come'', 帰る ''return'',
    入る ''enter'' and 出る ''leave''. Verbs like 歩く ''walk'', 走る ''run'' and 泳ぐ ''swim'' are not considered
    motion verbs because they express a manner of movement rather than a movement from one place to another.
    Therefore, the following sentence is ungrammatical.'
