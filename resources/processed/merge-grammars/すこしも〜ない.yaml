  writeup: Coming from the word少し(a little bit),すこしも〜ないis an expression which translates almost exactly
    to 'not even a little bit (A)' in English. Due to this, it indicates that there is 'no (A)', '(A)
    never happens', or 'not (A) at all', depending on whether a verb or an adjective is the word that
    is being negated.すこしもcan come at the beginning of the sentence, or directly before the word/statement
    it is referring to.Fun FactThis construction is another example of how theもparticle expresses that
    the word before it is surprising in some way, or unexpected. This was briefly discussed in theNumber+もgrammar
    point.Here we can see thatもis highlighting少し as being 'surprising'. This is where the 'not even!'
    meaning comes from.
