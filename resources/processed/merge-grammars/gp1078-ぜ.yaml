  writeup: ぜ is an emphatic sentence ending particle in Japanese that is used in a similar way to よ. It
    emphasizes what the speaker is saying, but is not as strong as similar particles like ぞ.ぜ may be used
    at the end of any sentence, so long as the previous word is in its plain form, this includes when
    following auxiliary verbs. In the case of nouns, ぜ will follow the auxiliary verb だ, rather than coming
    directly after the noun.ぜ will be used when the speaker is directing a statement at a person who they
    are familiar with, or are on close terms with. Although often having a hint of friendliness, ぜ may
    also be seen when the speaker is making a statement to a rival, or someone with whom they have a similar
    type of relationship. This is unlike ぞ, which may be directed at anybody. Despite this difference,
    both particles are almost exclusively used by men.Fun FactRather than being specifically different
    from the sentence-ending particle ぞ, ぜ actually originates from a combination of ぞ followed by え.
    え being an alternative form of the sentence-ending particle い, which is seen in forms like だい, かい.
    As い is primarily used in a 'friendly' or 'familiar' way, ぜ keeps the same nuance. In short, ぞえ became
    ぜ, which then became its own word over time.
