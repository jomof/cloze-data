  writeup: In Japanese, there are several ways to express that something 'should' be done. たほうがいい is one
    of the most common, especially when giving advice. This expression uses the past tense of a verb grouped
    with 方 , the particle が , and the い-Adjective , いい .As 方 can be translated closely to 'way', or 'direction',
    this expression is suggesting that one specific choice is simply the better 'way'.This expression
    is quite direct, and can imply that there may be some sort of negative consequence if (A) is not done.
    In that respect, this phrase could also be translated as 'It would be better if you did (A)'.たほうがいいmay
    also be used with the base (dictionary) form of a verb, but will sound more like a general opinion
    in those cases, rather than giving advice.CautionBecause this phrase is quite direct, it would be
    better to use a more polite expression like ばいい , if giving general advice.
