  writeup: When 方 is attached to the ます stem of a verb, it carries the nuance of the 'way of doing (A)'.
    This is identical to 方 's standard meaning of 'way', or 'direction'.When used with する verbs, sometimes
    the construction 仕方 is seen. This has exactly the same meaning as the form without kanji, and may
    be thought of as meaning 'way of dealing/attending to (A)', as 仕 's original meaning is 'to attend
    to (A)'. In these cases, the する verb is followed by の , and then 仕方 .Fun FactAfter attaching 方 to
    a verb, the entire expression is thought of as a noun-phrase. This means that it can be followed by
    particles such as は , を , and others, to create longer sentences.
