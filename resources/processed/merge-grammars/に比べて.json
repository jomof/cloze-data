    "writeup": "に比べて is a set expression in Japanese, used when comparing one thing to another. It is often simply translated as '(A) compared to (B)', or 'when comparing (A) to (B)'.比べる is a る - Verb that means 'to compare', or 'to contrast'.に比べて will be attached directly after a noun, before the (B) part of the sentence will explain the comparison that is being made.Occasionally, thecase marking particleと will be used instead ofに.にand と are largely interchangeable in this expression, withにfocusing slightly more on the changes/differences between similar features of (A) and (B). Alternatively と often mutually contrasts (A) and (B), discussing their individual/unique characteristics.CautionThe way that比べる is conjugated is not overly important to the sentence, so long as the meaning of 'if', or 'when' is conveyed. Due to this, に比べたら, に比べれば, and に比べると are all possible combinations.",
