  writeup: どの is classified as a 'pre-noun adjectival' in Japanese. These are a special type of word that
    do not conjugate, which means that they will always appear in the same form. どの comes from the same
    family of words as どれ and どこ , and is used for asking about 'which' thing someone will choose.In these
    examples, we can see that どの may be used to ask a question, or it may also be used in a similar way
    to 'whatever', or 'whichever' in English.Cautionどの is only used when there are 3 or more possible
    choices, and どっち ( の )・ どちら ( の ) will be used when there are only 2 possible choices.In the first
    example, the speaker is asking specifically about 2 options 'red or blue', so どっち will be used. However,
    in the second example, since the answer could be any color, どの will be used instead.
  examples:
    - japanese: 赤か青、どっちがいい?
      english: Do you prefer red or blue?
    - japanese: どの色が好き?
      english: What color do you like?
    - japanese: どの寿司屋がいいですか。
      english: Which sushi restaurant is good?
    - japanese: どのレストランに行く?
      english: Which restaurant will you go to?
    - japanese: どのブランドを選びますか。
