  writeup: Often, thenounとおりcarries the meaning of 'in that way', or 'just like that'. In its kanji form,とおりwill
    be written as通り, and literally means 'street', or 'way'. However, it is regularly used to indicate
    the level of 'sameness' one thing has with another. This 'sameness' meaning appears whenとおりis used
    as asuffix.とおり(or どおり) may be used with verbs or nouns. In the case of verbs, it is common to see
    it being used after both the plain form, and the simple-past form.Both どおり and のとおり may be used directly
    after nouns. However,とおりwill only be used when thecase marking particleの comes between the noun andとおり.While
    both of these structures may be used interchangeably, どおり is more common, especially in speech.Fun
    FactConstructions like言った通り and その通り are used very frequently, simply as a polite way to agree with
    what has been said by another. In these cases, it translates similarly to 'that's exactly right',
    or 'that's it!'.
