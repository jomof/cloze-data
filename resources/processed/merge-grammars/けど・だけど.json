    "writeup": "けど is one of the common conjunction particles in Japanese. These are particles that function by connecting the (A) and (B) parts of a sentence. けど works very similarly to が , in that it highlights 'while thinking about (A), (B)'. This means that けど will often come across as 'but' in English.As can be seen from these examples, just like many other grammatical constructions, だ will be required when using けど after a な-Adjective , or a noun.けど is just a modern (casual) version of けれども . Please see below for a list of the most casual, to the most formal variations.Casual - けど - けども - けれど - けれども - が - Formal.CautionThe phrase after けど will often be omitted if it is obvious, or the speaker does not want to say it.",
