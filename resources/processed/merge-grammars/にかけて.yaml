  writeup: Coming from the る - Verb掛ける 'to suspend', にかけて conveys that something is happening 'over a
    period of time', 'from (A) until (B)', or 'all through (A)'. This grammar structure is a combination
    of thecase marking particleに, and掛ける combined with theconjunction particleて. Literally, the meaning
    can be thought of as follows:に- Marks (A) as the location/state.掛けて - States that something is 'suspended'
    (in an ongoing process) in that location/state.The 'something' that is an ongoing process will usually
    be indicated by a (B) part of the sentence. This expression will primarily be used with nouns.にかけて
    is primarily used in written language, although it appears quite often in the news as well, indicating
    that some weather pattern is expected to continue for a set period of time.CautionOccasionally, theadverbial
    particleは is used after にかけて. This transforms the meaning of 'all through (A)', to something similar
    to 'limited to within (A)'. Any (B) phrase in these types of sentences will be contrasting (B) with
    (A), rather than saying (B) is occurring within (A).As we can see by these examples, this is an extension
    of the standard use of は, which shows that everything before it is a 'set state'. Therefore '(A) は
    (B)', means that 'only (A) defines (A), (B) is a separate entity/discussion'.
