  writeup: って is a casual variation of the と particle that is used for quoting something. This use is
    called 引用 in Japanese, which basically translates to 'reference', or 'citation'. って is almost exclusively
    used after direct quotations, and will be followed by a verb indicating what type of communication
    was used. 言 った, 思 った, 聞 いた, for example.Just like with と , the verb that comes after って is frequently
    omitted. This is even more true for って , as many things are omitted in casual language.CautionAlthough
    often heard, due to って being very casual, it can be considered unnatural to use in sentences that
    also use the です or ます polite structures. However, if the conversation is formal but friendly (like
    between a senpai and a kouhai), most people would consider it normal.

    - japanese: 「明日は雨が降りますか」って聞いた。
