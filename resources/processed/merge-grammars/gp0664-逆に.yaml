  writeup: 逆にis a grammar pattern that indicates that something is 'contrary' to what has previously been
    said. This is a structure made up of the noun逆'reverse', 'opposite', or 'converse', and に. Due to
    the inclusion of に, this phrase behaves adverbially, and will usually appear between two phrases,
    to indicate that 'on the contrary to (A), (B)', or 'conversely to (A), (B)'.In modern Japanese,逆にis
    also frequently used at the beginning of a sentence, simply to indicate a rebuttal toward something
    that someone has just said, or as a slang version of別に when asked questions about preferences, or
    similar things.
