    Register: Formal
    使用域: 硬い
  writeup: In a similar way toにつき,につけimplies that there is a something that is 'affixed' to the event
    or occasion of (A). However, unlikeに就きthis structure is a combination of に and the conjunctive form
    of the る-Verb付ける 'to affix', or 'to adhere'.When usingにつけ, the most common translation will be that
    something is happening 'every (A)', or 'whenever (A)'. In the (B) part of the sentence, the thoughts
    or feelings of the speaker will often be expressed in relation to (A). Additionally, (B) will always
    be something that is thought to happen naturally due to (A).This structure may appear with either
    verbs or nouns in their dictionary forms.It is also possible to seeにつけて, but the abbreviated form
    is far more common.Caution - This is considered a fairly old-fashioned grammar structure, so will
    mostly only be seen in literature or shows that are emphasizing a specific time period.
