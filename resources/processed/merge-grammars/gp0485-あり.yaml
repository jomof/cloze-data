  writeup: あり itself is the literary form of the う-Verb有る 'to be', and is used in a similar way to なし.
    However, rather than meaning that something is 'without (A)', it shows that something is 'with (A),
    amongst other things'. This 'amongst other things' is important, as あり will primarily be used when
    something is being presented as a single possibility among many possibilities.あり can be and often
    is used simply as a reply to a statement to indicate agreement, or that the listener thinks that what
    the speaker is saying is possible.Caution - Occasionally, the kanji在る may sometimes also be used.
    Although the difference between these two kanji is slight,有り indicates 'inclusiveness as part of a
    whole', while在り focuses more on 'stand-alone existence'.
