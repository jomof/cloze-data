  writeup: なさいis theimperative formof なさる, anhonorific languageverb which specifically highlights and
    respects the actions of another person (never the speaker).Despite being respectful, the fact that
    this is a 'command' means that it would never be used toward a superior. Due to this,なさいis most frequently
    used toward peers, or people of lower status, like children.To useなさい, simply connect it to the ます
    stem of any verb.なさいmay be shortened further to な, which becomes an even more casual form that is
    used most frequently toward peers.CautionBe careful not to get confused between な (the particle),
    and な (the shortened form ofなさい). These can seem very similar, but な (meaning don't) will always be
    used with the dictionary form of a verb, while な (meaning please do) will always be used with the
    ます stem of a verb.
