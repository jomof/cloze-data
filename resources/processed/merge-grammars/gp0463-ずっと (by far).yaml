  writeup: In addition to theずっとused to mean 'always', or 'non-stop', thisadverbmay also convey that one
    thing is 'by far (A)', or 'much more (A)' than something else. In these phrases,ずっとusually comes at
    the beginning of the sentence, before some form of comparison will be made between (A) and (B).Fun
    FactAlthoughずっとas 'ever since', or 'always' may seem quite different toずっとas 'way more', or 'by far',
    the literal meanings are actually exactly the same. In all cases,ずっとsimply highlights 'an extremely
    big interval'.
