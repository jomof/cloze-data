  writeup: ようではないかis a construction that will primarily be used for making suggestions for mutual activities.
    This is a combination of either of theauxiliary verbsう or よう, ではない, and the sentence-ending particle,
    か. う and よう primarily express will or intent like 'shall' in English. Due to the negation following
    them, the literal translation will be similar to 'shall we not do (A)?'. For ease of translation,
    this structure can be remembered as simply 'let's do (A)', or 'why don't we do (A)'.As with all structures
    that use う or よう,ようではないかwill be attached to the end of a verb indicating the action which is being
    suggested.Alternatively, the abbreviated form of じゃない may be used in place of ではない.Despite this,ようではないかis
    primarily a formal grammar structure, so will most often use the unabbreviated version, or even more
    politeようではありませんかconstruction.Fun-fact - Occasionally, this grammar structure may be seen preceded
    by もらう. In these cases, it is usually challenging the listener to do something. This can be interpreted
    as 'why don't I have you do (A) then'.
