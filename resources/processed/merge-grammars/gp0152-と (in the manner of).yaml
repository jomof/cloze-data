  writeup: '## 1. と is basically used to mark a quotation; the literal meaning of という is ''say with the
    (the sound) ~''. This use of と, however, has been extended further to cover indirect quotations, as
    in Examples (a) and (b), and even thoughts (i.e., internal voice), as in Example (c). Note that in
    Japanese と is necessary for both direct and indirect quotations, as seen in Key Sentence and Example
    (a). 2. と is used to mark the content of such actions as 思う ''think; feel'', 考える ''think (with the
    intellect)'', 書く ''write'', 聞く ''hear'', and 説明する ''explain''. 3. と is also used with phonomimes,
    as in Example (d). Again, the idea is that someone/something makes the sound marked by と when doing
    something. Note that sound symbolisms in Japanese are not children''s words. Rather, they are an important
    part of the Japanese vocabulary. 4. When a sound is repeated twice like バタバタ in Example (d), と can
    be omitted. When a sound is not repeated, however, と does not drop. Examples: (1) a. 子供達はバタバタと/Ø走り回った。
    Literally: The children ran around with a clattering noise. b. 正男はバタンと/*Øドアを閉めた。 Masao slammed the
    door (literally: closed the door with a bang). 5. The use of と with phonomimes is extended to phenomimes
    and psychomimes, as in Examples (e) and (f), though these are not representations of actual sounds.'
