  writeup: In addition to the base meaning ofつつ'while doing (A)' when used by itself, the addition of
    も simply adds the nuance of 'even'. This is often translated as 'even while doing (A), (B)', or 'although
    doing (A), (B)'. (B) will almost always be something that is somehow contradictory to (A).Likeつつ,
    つつも will appear after the ます-stem of a verb that is the original ongoing action.Caution - Likeつつ,つつもwill
    usually include a non-physical action in (A), such as reading, listening, looking, thinking, etc.
    (B) may be either physical or non-physical. Also, in the same way asつつis similar toながら,つつもis similar
    toながらも.Despite the similarities, it will be important to remember thatつつonly appears with verbs, whileながらcan
    be used after almost any type of word.
