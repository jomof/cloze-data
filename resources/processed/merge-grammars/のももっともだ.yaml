  writeup: のももっともだis a combination of の, も, the な-Adjective もっとも, meaning 'reasonable', or 'plausible',
    and theauxiliary verbだ. In many cases, the interpretation will be 'it may well be (A)', 'it's only
    natural that (A)', or 'there's no wonder that (A)'. However,尤も itself is simply an adjective that
    affirms that the speaker understands the thought process behind (A), and that it is logical to them,
    regardless of whether or not they actually agree with it themselves. Due to this, 'it may well be
    (A)' in English is actually a very close translation of the feeling behind the expression.のももっともだwill
    appear with verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, and nouns. In the case of nouns, the の will be dropped,
    as the noun itself will become the expression being marked as the focus.Due toのももっともだbeing used when
    the speaker is expressing that they understand the underlying reasons behind something, phrases used
    for explanation such as から or ので will often be seen in the same sentence.
