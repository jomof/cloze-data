  writeup: ていてはis a structure often seen with verbs that will express that 'if one continues with (A),
    (B)'. In most cases, this will indicate a negative outcome.ていてはis a combination of the て-form of a
    verb,居る 'to be' in its て-form, and は. The final ては is often considered its own conjunctive structure
    that may either exhibit hypothetical situations, or repetitive actions. In this case, it's a bit of
    a mix of both, depending on the verb it is attached to.Fun-fact - Apart from the inclusion ofているto
    the base verb in order to show continuation, the ては inていてはis the same ては that appears with other set
    patterns such asてはいけない,てはならない, and てはだめ when expressing something negative.
