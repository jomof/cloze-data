  writeup: これ is often thought to be equal to 'this' in English, which is basically correct. これ will always
    be used to highlight something that is close to the speaker either emotionally, or physically.Despite
    being translated as a ' pronoun ' in English, it might be easier to think of これ as a substitute noun
    (the literal meaning in Japanese), as this is always its function. これ substitutes for something that
    has its own name, but is not required in the context of the sentence, or is simply unknown by the
    speaker.
  examples:
    - japanese: これはペンです。
      english: This is a pen.
    - japanese: これは本です。
      english: This is a book.
    - japanese: これは寿司です。
      english: This is sushi.
    - japanese: これも寿司です。
      english: This is also sushi.
    - japanese: これは、海です。
