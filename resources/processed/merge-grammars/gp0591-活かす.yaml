  writeup: Whenを活かすis partnered with a noun, it shows that (A) is something that is being made good use
    of, or leveraged. This can be in relation to skills, experiences, attributes, and many other things.This
    grammar point may appear either in the form of the う-Verb活かす'to enliven' or生かす'to keep alive', with
    very little change in nuance. However,活かすtends to appear far more frequently, as the focus of this
    kanji is less in relation to the preservation of life, and more on just 'making good use' of something.When
    linked to a (B) noun, in order to show that something 'has' been made good use of,活かすwill appear in
    the past tense.Fun-fact -活かすwill often be used with adverbs of amount or quality, in order to highlight
    just how well (A) is being made good use of, or capitalized on. Examples include十分に 'adaquately',有効に
    'effectively',最大限に 'to the fullest', and similar words.
