  writeup: In order to say that one thing is 'based on' another in Japanese, the expressionに基づいてwill be
    used. This is a combination of thecase marking particleに, the う - Verb,基づく 'to originate from', and
    theconjunction particleて. This expression regularly highlights some kind of judgement/conclusion that
    the speaker has made, using (A) as their base.To useに基づいて, put the noun (or noun phrase) that you
    would like to identify as a 'basis' beforeに基づいて, and then express your judgment/conclusion in part
    (B) of the sentence.Alternatively, the past form of基づく may be used when connected directly to a second
    noun. (A) に基づいた (B) directly expresses that (B) is based on (A).Fun FactThe kanji基is fairly accurately
    translated as 'foundation', and is regularly used to highlight things that 'stem' from something.
    Due to this,に基づいてmay also be used to identify things that are 'produced from (A)', 'created from (A)',
    or 'invented based on (A)'.
