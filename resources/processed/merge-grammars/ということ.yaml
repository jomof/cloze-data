  writeup: One of the ways to perform nominalization (turning a phrase into a noun) in Japanese is through
    the use of the expressionということ. This grammar point is a combination ofと(the particle),言う (the verb),
    andこと(the noun). Together, the literal translation is close to 'that (A) is said to be'. However,
    in reality, it sounds far less formal than this.To useということ, attach it to the end of any phrase (withoutです,
    or ます). In most cases it will be written using hiragana.In conversation, という is regularly shortened
    to simplyって. This form will be heard/seen much more frequently in conversation/manga and similar things.ということis
    also frequently used when clarifying what someone else has said. In these cases, it translates very
    similarly to 'you mean that (A)?', or 'you mean to say that (A)?'CautionAlthough the kanji言う and事may
    be used in this expression, the most common form does not use any kanji at all. This is a regular
    occurance in Japanese, as many set grammatical structures will not use kanji, simply because it makes
    the pattern easier to identify.
