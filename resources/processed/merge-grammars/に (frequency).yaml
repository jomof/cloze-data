  writeup: When thecase marking particleにis used, sometimes it has the nuance of 'frequency'. This means
    that it can be utilized to describe how often something happens/is done. In this grammatical construction,
    the 'time frame' is followed byに, then followed by the number of times that you would like to say
    that something happens.In this way,にkeeps its regular nuance of being a 'goal', or 'destination',
    within which something else takes place.CautionThis use ofにshould not be confused withでin relation
    to time. Whenでis used for 'time', it is expressing the amount of time that is required to do something,
    or how much time something is expected to take. It is not used for frequency.Due to this, you can
    think ofにas marking a portion (or portions) of time inside of a larger space of time, within which
    something happens. However,でmarks a whole space of time, within which something can be/is completed.
