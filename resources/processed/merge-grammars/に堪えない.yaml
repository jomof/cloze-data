  writeup: に堪えないis a construction that will translate as ‘to not be able to bear (A)’, or ‘to not be able
    to tolerate (A)’. It is a mix of thecase-marking particleに, and the negatived form of the る-Verb堪える
    ‘to tolerate’,堪えない.In this meaning,に堪えないwill be used following verbs. This is in contrast to the に堪えない
    grammar point that follows nouns, and means ‘to be very (A)’, but is more literally ‘to be so (A)
    I can’t stand it’.Although堪える will be used more often than other kanji that have the same reading
    and similar meanings, this is not always the case. Occasionally耐える ‘to withstand’ will be used when
    the emphasis is on the ability to endure (A), while絶える ‘to discontinue’, or ‘to peter out’ will be
    used when the emphasis is on not being able to suppress (A). For絶える, this is especially used in the
    case of strong feelings.CautionThe affirmative form of に堪える may also be used to express that something
    is ‘worth doing’. A closer interpretation of this would be similar to an English phrase like ‘to be
    passable for (A)’. Rather than meaning that something is particularly suitable, it just highlights
    that it also acceptably falls in the category of (A), despite not being intended for it, or perhaps
    not expected.
