  writeup: As mentioned in the several other grammar structures that include べく,  this structure is theconjunctive
    formof theclassical auxiliary verbべし ‘shall’. It will be attached to thedictionary formof verbs in
    order to convey the purpose, necessity, or likelihood of an action. When combined with theadverbial
    particleも, and the い-Adjective ない, it is often translated as ‘it is impossible to (A)’, or ‘there
    is no way to (A)’.べくもないis a pattern that usually appears with verbs highlighting the thinking or emotions
    of the speaker, and how that action is impossible or inconceivable for them.CautionIn the case of
    する, べく may be connected directly to する, or to the stem, す.
