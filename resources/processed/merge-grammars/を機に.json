    "writeup": "When used as a noun,機‘opportunity’ indicates a time that is being used as suitable chance to do something. It is slightly formal and will usually be translated as ‘on the occasion of (A), (B)’. However, due to this grammar point being a construction of theadverbial particleを,機, and thecase-marking particleに, it is indicating that the speaker is actively making use of the opportunity of (A)’. Due to this, it can be understood as ‘taking advantage of (A), (B)’, or ‘taking advantage of the time of (A), (B)’ on many occasions.を機にwill directly follow nouns marking (A), before going on to explain how that (A) was utilized as an opportunity.を機にtends to be used most frequently when (B) is an action that the speaker is choosing to take primarily with (A) as the enabling factor, or being a good excuse.",
