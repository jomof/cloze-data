  writeup: Theauxiliary verbらしいis very similar to theauxiliary verbsそうだandようだ, in that it expresses something
    that the speaker 'thinks' is true. This use is known as推定(presumption) in Japanese. However, despite
    being a presumption/assumption,らしいusually sounds relatively confident.らしいis regularly translated as
    'it seems like (A)', or 'I heard that (A)'.To useらしい, attach it to end of any (non-polite) verb, adjective,
    or noun.In these examples,らしいindicates that the speaker has some reason to believe that (A) is true.
    This could be that they heard, saw, or read something, but are still not 100% sure whether their understanding
    is correct or not. In this way, it sounds very similar to 'it appears as though (A)' in English.CautionThere
    are 2 main forms ofらしいin Japanese. Theauxiliary verbusage mentioned above, and the形容詞の一部(auxiliary
    adjective), a type of adjective that must be attached to another word for it have have any meaning
    usage.らしいhas the meaning of something that is 'typical of (A)', when used as an auxiliary adjective.Thisい-Adjectiveuse
    ofらしいwill be covered more in our secondらしいlesson.

  writeup: '## 1. らしい is generally used when the speaker makes a conjecture based on some information
    which he has heard, read or seen. What he has heard is especially important. Unlike そうだ2, which expresses
    a simple guess based on what the speaker sees, らしい is used when the conjecture is based on more reliable
    information. (⇨ そうだ2) (For a comprehensive comparison of conjecture expressions, see (⇨ ようだ, Related
    Expressions.)'
