  writeup: 'To make the past form of a う-Verb in Japanese, just like all other conjugations of う-Verbs
    , you will need to change the last kana, before adding the auxiliary verb た (casual), or ました (polite).
    This change in kana is a bit different to other conjugations of う-Verbs , so let''s take a look at
    them for the casual form.As can be seen in these examples, the changes consist of った, いた, いだ, んだ,
    した (the same as the changes for て form , but using た instead). For the conjugations using だ in place
    of た, this is simply a sound change in the language that happened over the course of history, to make
    words easier/smoother to say. It is not the auxiliary verb だ .For the polite past form of う-Verbs
    , the change in sound is far more consistent. This only requires a change from the う sound, to the
    い sound within the same column (from う to い, or from く to き, for example).When た is added to verbs
    (or any other word), it can have one of three possible meanings.Past: 過去 - Happened at some point
    in the past. (Did/Was)Completion: 完了 - An action that has finished ''happening''. (Done)Continuation:
    存続 - A new state of something that is continuing. (Has been done)CautionWith う-Verbs , there are a
    few verbs that are exceptions to the regular conjugation rules. Please check the structure guide for
    these.'
  examples:
    - japanese: 昨日、本を読んだ。昨日、本を読みました。
      english: I read a book yesterday.
    - japanese: 牛乳を飲んだ。牛乳を飲みました。
      english: I drank milk.
    - japanese: ロンドンへ飛んだ。ロンドンへ飛びました。
      english: I flew to London.
    - japanese: 私たちのチームは勝った！私たちのチームは勝ちました！
      english: Our team won!
    - japanese: メアリーは日本に帰った。メアリーは日本に帰りました。
      english: Mary returned to Japan.
