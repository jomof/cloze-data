  writeup: Verb+てもいい is a construction in Japanese used to express that something is 'okay', or 'alright'.
    It can also be used as a question to ask if you 'can', or 'may' do something.This phrase is also regularly
    used without the も , but is considered a bit more direct/casual. It is best to remove the も only when
    talking to people that you know well.This expression is simply a construction that literally means
    て (verb) も (also) いい (is good).CautionAs this grammar point uses the て form of verbs, it is important
    to remember that some verbs will use で instead of て .
  examples:
    - japanese: これを見てもいい?
      english: Is it alright if I look at this?
    - japanese: 質問をしてもいい?
      english: May I ask a question?
    - japanese: 暑いです。水を飲んでもいいですか。
      english: It's hot. Is it alright to drink some water?
    - japanese: あそこで遊んでもいいです。
