  writeup: まみれ, seen primarily in hiragana only, is a grammar pattern that indicates being 'completely
    covered in (A)', 'smeared all over with (A)', or 'stained with (A)'. It will follow nouns, and may
    appear asまみれのwhen linked directly to a second noun thatまみれis modifying.In the vast majority of cases,まみれwill
    be used in regard to something that is negative, or can be perceived negatively even if it is not
    physical, like debt or desires. Examples of physically negative things include but are not limited
    to blood, mud, oil, etc.Fun Factまみれis the noun form of the る-Verb塗れる, coming from the same kanji and
    with a similar meaning as塗る, 'to paint'. Just like 'to paint', まみれる andまみれprimarily describe something
    covering the outer surface of another object, rather than its contents.
