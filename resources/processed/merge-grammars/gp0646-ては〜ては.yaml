  writeup: Another structure making use of the combined て and は particles isては〜ては. This grammar pattern
    highlights that the actions of (A) and (B) are continuously being repeated and can be interpreted
    as 'doing (A) and (B) repeatedly'. The (A) and (B) actions will often be things that contrast each
    other in some respect, such as starting and stopping, walking and running, going forwards and then
    backwards, etc.ては〜てはwill be used with verbs in the て-form, so will occasionally appear as では.The abbreviated
    versions ofちゃandじゃmay also be seen with the grammar point, but it may be considered unnatural if the
    same abbreviation is not used both times. This is mainly due to the level of formality being required
    to stay the same within sentences.Caution -てはmay sometimes appear only once, without any change to
    the meaning of repetition. This is usually when there is some indication in the rest of the sentence
    that the action is something that is being repeated over and over.
