  writeup: というis a combination of thecase marking particleと, and the う - Verb言う. It is a set expression
    that primarily uses only hiragana.というconnects two nouns, and means 'the (B) that is called (A)', or
    'the (B) known as (A)'.Fun Factという(and the verb言う itself) is often quite misunderstood, as the closest
    translation in English is 'to say'. In Japanese,言う actually refers to the information about something
    that cannot be discovered by simply 'looking at' it. For example, if you look at a man, you cannot
    know that his name is Bob, or that he works in an office, but you can know whether he is 'short',
    'tall', etc. Due to this,というshould only be used to express information that requires intimate knowledge,
    and not simple observations.It is possible to see (A)という(B) in sentences where (A) is describing something
    that seems 'obvious'. However, in these cases, the speaker is usually implying that something about
    (A) is not exactly as it seems, or that their opinion/knowledge differs.This particular nuance is
    not limited to nouns, and may be seen with almost any word type.
