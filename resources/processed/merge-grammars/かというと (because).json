    "writeup": "〜かというと is a phrase that has two primary functions. The first is used in conjunction with 'why' and 'how' words, like どうして or なぜ, while the other is used with 'who', 'when', 'where', and 'what'. We will focus on the former in this lesson. かというと is a combination of thecase marking particleか in its use as a question marker, thecase marking particleとin itscitationuse, the う - Verb言う 'to say', and thecase marking particleと in itsresultuse.This is quite a few particles combined together, but the literal meaning is more simply 'if (A) were to be asked', before the speaker will go on to highlight their reasoning in (B).As 〜かというと will come before some sort of explanation, から will also regularly be used at the end of the sentence as 'because', emphasizing the speaker's reasoning.CautionLike other grammar points that utilize the 'if' nuance ofと,ば, and sometimes evenたらmay be used. However,たらwill appear far less frequently than と orば.",
