  writeup: When combined with the case-marking particle に, ながら 'while' as asuffixwill indicate that something
    remains in the state of (A), while also having or doing (B). This can be translated as 'while being
    (A), (B)', or '(A) as always (B)'.ながらにwill be seen following nouns, or verbs in their stem form. Additionally,
    して may be added to the end of に, without any change to the nuance.ながらにis a structure that has many
    potential translations in English, but the key point to remember is that (B) is something that is
    being highlighted as happening or existing in same state as (A) in an unchanged state. This doesn't
    necessarily mean at the same time. For example, in the case of生まれながらに, it can be translated as '(B)
    has existed since birth', but what it really means is that 'while being in the state of (A), (B) is
    still there'.Cautionながらにtends to only be used with a limited set of words, so it is best not to use
    it with structures that you have not already seen at some point in the past.
