  writeup: '## 1. The reason why 様 ''appearance'' is used to show one''s respect is that 様 allows one
    to refer indirectly to one''s superior. For instance, 山田様 is a more indirect way to refer to a person
    called 山田 than to call him simply 山田, because 山田様 literary means ''appearance of 山田''. Note, however,
    that a personal name+様 is not used in conversational Japanese, except in highly polite speech used
    to clientele by clerks/attendants of hotels, restaurants, travel agencies, department stores, etc.'
