    "writeup": "を限りにis a structure that follows nouns in order to express a time for which something that was continuing will finish by. Common interpretations include ‘ending with (A), (B)’, and ‘no longer than (A), (B)’. This grammar pattern makes use of theadverbial particleを, the noun限り ‘limit’, and thecase-marking particleに.を限りにis primarily used for making proclamations or announcements, and is more formal than similar structures like限りで.Fun FactAlthoughを限りにalmost always follows words indicating a specific time or place that is being viewed temporally, there is also the set expression声を限りに, ‘to the limit of one’s voice’ that breaks this usual rule.",
