  writeup: One of the most misunderstood words in Japanese is訳. Of the many ways it can be translated,
    the most common are 'reason', 'cause', 'meaning', or 'conclusion'. Despite this, it may be beneficial
    to consider it almost identical to an equally versatile English word 'so'.In all of its uses, わけ simply
    highlights the plain existence/determination of something in the same way that 'so' does in English.
    This can be seen in its most basic form inわけだ. A combination of わけ and theauxiliary verbだ.わけだwill
    be used at the end of sentences, and is sometimes preceded by という. This use is often translated as
    'for the reason of (A)', 'no wonder its (A)', or 'its (A), as you'd expect'. Realistically though,
    it just means 'it is so that it's (A)', or 'so it's (A)'.Due to わけ being a noun, it will need to follow
    theattributive formof whatever word comes before it. As we can see 'so' and わけ have an extremely close
    pattern of nuances, ranging from 'because', all the way through to simple emphasis (like with 'naturally',
    and 'as you'd expect').わけ may also be used in questions, implying that the speaker is trying to determine
    something that they have heard. わけだね 'so its (A) right?', and わけですか 'so is it that (A)?' are good
    examples of this.
