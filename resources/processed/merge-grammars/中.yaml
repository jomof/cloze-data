  writeup: As asuffix,中is frequently used to highlight a period of time (or space). By attaching thecase
    marking particleに, the sentence can be modified, to show that (B) is happening/existing throughout
    the timeframe/space of (A). This is often translated as 'throughout (A), (B)', or 'during (A), (B)'.
    First, let's take a look at中being used to show events that are in process.Now, to show that a (B)
    event is happening within (A), simply add thecase marking particleにto show a 'temporal location'.
    This will be done by attachingにto the end of any noun that you would like to indicate as the being
    the 'space' within which another thing exists/occurs.In these examples, we can see that中にis sometimes
    read/said as中に. The basic rule for when to use ちゅう or when to use じゅう is as follows:中に- Expresses
    a very specific (usually small) amount of time/space, or something that is not always the same (an
    amount of time/space that can change, depending on the person/situation). This 'thing' that ちゅう highlights
    is usually a 'process', and therefore means that (A) is 'in the process' of happening.Examples - A
    meeting, class, visit to somewhere.中に- Expresses a predetermined amount of time/space that will always
    remain the same, regardless of the person/situation. Therefore, じゅう does not highlight a 'process',
    but focuses on the 'length' or 'space' itself. This tends to mean 'all throughout', as it focuses
    on the full amount of time/space.Examples - A day, year, house, town or country.CautionThere is also
    a difference between音読み (chinese readings of words), and訓読み (japanese readings of words).じゅう is used
    more frequently with訓読み - (今年中,夏休み中,今晩中)ちゅう is used more frequently with音読み - (水中,会議中,試合中)
