  writeup: ませんか (or ないか more casually) is an expression that is used after verbs as an invitation. It
    basically translates to 'won't you do (A) with me?'.This expression is a little bit different to ましょうか
    , in that it sounds directly like an invitation to do (A). ましょうか tends to sound more like a suggestion
    that (A) should be done.It is recommended to use the ませんか version, as ないか would be a bit too casual
    to use with someone that you are not very close with (and is also technically not correct Japanese).To
    make it clearer that the speaker wants to do (A) 'with' someone, expressions like 一緒 に 'together'
    are often added, for clarification.To examine the difference between ましょうか and ませんか , let's have a
    look at how the nuance changes in the same type of sentence.Here, ませんか will come across as an invitation
    due to the fact that you are asking the person if they 'wouldn't mind doing (A)' with you. This is
    the main reason that it is considered a more polite option when inviting someone to do something,
    than ましょうか .
