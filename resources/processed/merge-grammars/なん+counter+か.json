    "writeup": "The expressionなん+counter+かin Japanese is a way of highlighting an uncertain number of something, and comes across similarly to 'some', 'several', or 'a few' in English. Literally, the meaning is much closer to 'what+counter+I wonder?', as it shows the speaker's uncertainty about the number.In addition to なん; いく, from the kanji幾(how many/much) may be used as part of this construction. While both are fairly common,幾is more common as part of set expressions, like幾ら(how much) and幾つ(how many/old), while なん is more common for counting specific things, like people.Both何and幾are regularly seen in plain hiragana and their kanji forms, so it is worth remembering both.CautionDespite having the same kanji as何, なん will almost always be used to count things, while なに will be used to identify things.",
