  writeup: One of the roles that the particle の can take in Japanese is replacing a noun that has already
    been mentioned, or one that has not been mentioned yet. In this way, it is similar to 'the one that
    (A)' in English. When using this expression, we will need to use な before の , when a な-Adjective is
    being used.When using this expression, の will be followed by は , が , or も , depending on what the
    speaker/writer wants to express.Cautionの may be used more than once in the same sentence, referring
    to the same noun.
