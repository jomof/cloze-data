  writeup: The verb呉れるin Japanese, is very similar to与える (to bestow). The primary difference is that呉れる(primarily
    written in hiragana) means to 'bestow to the speaker' (or someone in the speakers inner circle).In
    this way,てくれるis the opposite ofてあげる, which conveys that someone (usually the speaker) gives (an action)
    to another person that is outside of their inner circle.てくれるis commonly translated as 'would you do
    (A) for me', as a question, or 'someone did (A) for me', as a statement.When asking for a favor,てくれるcan
    be shortened toてくれ. However, this is very casual, and should not be used with strangers (or anyone
    that you do not know well). As an English equivalent,てくれsounds similar to phrases like 'would ya do
    (A)', or 'could ya do (A)?'Fun Factてくれるis one of the most casual ways to ask for a favor, withてもらうbeing
    slightly more polite.ていただく(thehumble speechvariation ofてくれる) is even more polite than either of these!
