  writeup: ずつ, or宛in its kanji form, is asuffixin Japanese that is used to highlight things that occur/exist
    in specific amounts. It is often translated simply as 'each', 'per', or 'at a time'. Depending on
    the source,ずつmay also be considered to be anadverbial particle. However, this will not change the
    way that it is utilized.ずつ is used directly after the number/amount of something that it is highlighting
    as being the 'at a time' grouping.Fun FactThe kanji,宛, literally means 'allotment', and refers to
    distinct groupings. It is regularly used in reference to where people live (their address being considered
    their 'allotment'). In these cases though, it has the reading宛. Forずつ, 'allotment' may also be used
    as an accurate translation in almost all situations.
