  writeup: The combination of a verb with theauxiliary verbう, orよう, followed by theう-Verb思う gives us the
    common expressionようと思う. This expression is often translated as 'I think I will (A)', or 'I shall (A)'.
    It is also close to the casual expression 'I'm gonna (A)'.Remembering thatうandようcan have one of three
    possible meanings in Japanese (as discussed in theようgrammar point),ようと思うis usually only used to express
    one of those three. That 'one' is as follows:意志- Expresses intentions (has a similar meaning to〜するつもりだ)This
    expression is also often used with思っている. In these cases, it highlights that the intention of the speaker
    is something that they regularly think, or have been thinking about for some time.思っているmay also be
    used when describing the intentions of another person, as discussed in our lesson aboutと思う.CautionLet's
    be careful to remember the difference between theauxiliary verbsよう, andようだ. They are different constructions
    that have different meanings, and behave in unique ways grammatically.
