  writeup: げ, sometimes seen in the kanji form気is asuffixin Japanese that expresses that something is
    'giving off the feeling of (A)', or 'seems like (A)'.げis frequently used in relation to emotions,
    feelings, and things that the speaker generally can't be 100% sure of due to them not being directly
    visible.げis primarily seen used after the stem form of い-Adjectives, but may also appear following
    the stem forms of nouns of な-Adjectives. In all of these cases, the addition ofげcreates a new な-Adjective
    meaning '(A) seeming'. Due to this,げmay then be followed by either な or に, depending on whether it
    is altering a verb or a noun later in the sentence.げis more subjective (based on the speaker's opinion)
    than そう, and is considered to be very low confidence. This may be considered a byproduct of the original気,
    meaning of 'attention', referring to the way that the speaker 'senses (A)', regardless of what is
    actually true for (A) on the inside.
