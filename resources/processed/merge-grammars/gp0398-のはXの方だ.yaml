  writeup: のは〜の方だ is an expression used to show that (A) (usually despite expectations) is (B). It can
    be translated as 'the one that (A), is (B)'. This phrase is made up of the following parts:のは - Used
    for nominalization (creating a noun phrase). は highlights contrast between two (or more) elements.の方-
    A combination of の, thecase marking particle, and方, a noun meaning 'side', or 'direction'.だ(orです)
    - Theauxiliary verbused for 'determining' something.The literal meaning of this grammar point is something
    similar to 'that which is (A), is on the side of (B)'. By saying that something is on the 'side' of
    (B), it comes across more gently than expressly stating that it 'is (B)'.To use this construction,
    attach のは to the end of a phrase, and then follow it with a noun+の方だ. Note that のは will become なのは
    if the final word before のは is a noun.Fun FactThis phrase is often used apologetically, to express
    that someone feels that they are the individual who is (more) responsible (for causing a certain outcome).
