  writeup: とあってis a formal grammar expression that combines thecase marking particleと with the て-form
    of ある 'to be'. It is used to present an unusual situation from which an obvious result will or has
    occurred. It is often translated as 'since (A), it is no wonder that (B)', or 'because of (A), it's
    natural that (B)'.とあってis usually seen following almost any word in theirstandard forms, but な-Adjectives
    will require a だ to come between them andとあって.This construction can be thought of as similar to として
    'as', but with focus more on 'what (A) is or is viewed as', emphasized through ある, rather than 'how
    (A) conducts itself or is conducted', emphasized through する.Cautionとあってis only used objectively, and
    will not refer to the speaker or writer themselves.
