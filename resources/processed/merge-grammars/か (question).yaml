  writeup: か is a particle that frequently comes at the end of sentences in Japanese, and carries the
    same meaning as a question mark in English. (It is not limited to appearing at the end of sentences,
    however). In addition to questions, か can also express uncertainty about something, without strictly
    being a question.か regularly comes after the polite form of words, such as 〜 です か , 〜ます か . However,
    in casual conversation, か can be used directly after the word that the speaker is showing uncertainty
    about.Both examples are grammatically correct, but the sentence without です may be considered rude
    by some people (as it sounds too familiar/direct).
  examples:
    - japanese: これは本ですか。
      english: Is this a book?
    - japanese: これはあなたの本ですか。
      english: Is this your book?
    - japanese: これもあなたの本ですか。
      english: Is this also your book?
    - japanese: これはペンですか。
      english: Is this a pen?
    - japanese: これはいいですか。
