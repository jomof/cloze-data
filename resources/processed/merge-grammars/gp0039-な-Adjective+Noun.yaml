  writeup: In Japanese, almost any type of word can be attached to the beginning of a noun to modify the
    meaning, or describe the qualities of that noun. However, depending on the type of word used, conjugation
    rules will differ slightly.For な-Adjectives , they will always need to be followed by な , when used
    before a noun. This means that adjective (A) is describing qualities/features of noun (B).CautionMany
    words can take either な or の when describing a noun. The difference in meaning is usually clear. Let's
    take a look at both nuances.(A) な (B) means that - (A) is a quality/feature of (B)(A) の (B) means
    that - (A) is the type/purpose of (B)To avoid making this mistake when using な-Adjectives to describe
    a noun, it can be helpful to think about whether you are describing a 'quality', or the 'purpose'
    of something.
  examples:
    - japanese: 幸せな日。
      english: A happy day. (A 'quality' of this day is that it is 'happy')
    - japanese: 幸せの匂い。
      english: The smell of happiness. (The 'type' of smell is that of 'happiness')
    - japanese: 暇な一日。
      english: A free day
    - japanese: 旭が丘は静かな街です。
      english: Asahigaoka is a quiet town.
    - japanese: たなかさんは親切な人だ。
      english: Tanaka-san is a kind person.
    - japanese: これは便利なツールです。
      english: This is a convenient tool.
    - japanese: 綺麗なタオルはトイレにある。
      english: There are clean towels in the bathroom.
