  writeup: かろう is an old fashioned grammar pattern that stems from the indeterminate form of the い-Adjective,
    かろ, and the addition of the auxiliary verb う. This transforms what would be seen in modern Japanese
    as いい+でしょう into よかろう.The meaning itself is the same as だろう and でしょう in expressing agreement or volition,
    but tends to only be used in dramas or things like anime these days. To use this grammar pattern,
    simply replace the terminal い of the adjective with かろう.The combination of ない and かろう is also fairly
    common, and will conjugate in the same way as above, as ない itself is an い-Adjective.Even within drama
    and manga, this construction tends to only be used by elderly characters, or characters that have
    a high level of authority.
