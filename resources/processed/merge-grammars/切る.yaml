  writeup: Another verb that is often seen used after theconjunctive formof other verbs is the う - Verb切る'to
    cut'.切るwill give the (A) verb the nuance of being done 'to completion'. However, the 'completion'
    that is being conveyed with切るis usually caused by the running out of some kind of resource, like energy.
    Due to this,切るis often translated as 'to do (A) to the point of being unable to continue' (or not
    needing to continue), or 'to totally and utterly do (A)'.Occasionally,切るmay also be used to show that
    (A) is being done at 'full pelt', 'full steam', or 'full capacity'. In these cases, it is similar
    to 'to resolutely do (A)', and just means that 100% effort is being put into the action.
