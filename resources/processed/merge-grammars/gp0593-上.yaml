  writeup: Attaching to nouns,上is asuffixthat highlights when something is being presented 'from the standpoint
    of (A)'. The 'standpoint' that上will indicate is usually a specific field or area of concern. The (B)
    part of the sentence will then go on to describe what exactly is being considered from that standpoint.上is
    fairly formal, and can be interpreted similarly to に関して 'in connection to', in that it is just expressing
    that (B) is being discussed in relation to (A).As上will be used with matters of concern, it is very
    frequently seen with words that express broad fields, such as work '仕事', 'education'教育, 'history'歴史,
    'health'健康, 'experience'経験, 'the law'法律, and other similar things.Caution - Despite expressing standpoints,上cannot
    be used to indicate an individual person's point of view. Because of this, it cannot be used as asuffixfor
    names of people or organizations that something is being considered from.
