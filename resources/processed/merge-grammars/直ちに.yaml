  writeup: Theadverb直ちにis commonly used in Japanese to convey that something is happening 'immediately',
    or 'at once'. Like many adverbs, it will regularly appear at the beginning of a sentence.Fun FactComing
    from the kanji直, meaning 'direct',直ちにoften carries the nuance that something is done 'directly' (and
    purposely). This is usually after something happens, or after something is completed. To indicate
    things that happen immediately, but not intentionally,忽ち may be used.
