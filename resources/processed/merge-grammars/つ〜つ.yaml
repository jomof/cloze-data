    highlighting contrasting verbs. Thisつ〜つstructure is often translated as 'to be doing (A) and (B) over
    and over', where the actions are happening repeatedly one after the other.つwill connect to theconjunctive
    formof verbs, with (A) and (B) generally appearing in direct sequence.Additionally, it is also quite
    common to see the same verb being repeated in both places. When this happens, the (A) verb will be
    in thestandard form, while the (B) verb will be in the passive form. This just translates as 'to do
