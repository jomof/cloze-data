    "writeup": "In this expression, がある has the role of describing the noun that follows it. The description that it is giving is '(A) がある (B)' = '(B) has/with (A)'. This type of phrase is called a relative clause (something that describes a noun), and behaves similarly to an adjective.In English, a relative clause would require a pronoun such as 'who' 誰 , 'which' どれ, 'that' それ・あれ, 'where' どこ. However, these types of words are not required in Japanese, and the noun will follow がある directly.CautionIn a relative clause, because (A) is describing (B), (B) will be considered the 'main topic/subject'. This means that は will generally not be used in place of が . However, の can be used instead of が , as showing a relationship between (A) and (B) is one of the main functions of の .",
