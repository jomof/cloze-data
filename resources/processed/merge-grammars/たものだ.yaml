  writeup: As mentioned the ものだ lesson, the combination of thenoun物'thing', with theauxiliary verbだ forms
    a strong determination about whatever comes before it as being 'the way it is'. As an extension of
    this nuance, ものだ can be paired with verbs in the past tense, creating a phrase similar to 'I used
    to (A) in the past'. However, the literal meaning is closer to '(A) was the way it used to be'.Due
    to ものだ being a strong determination of something's existence/truth, this expression quite often carries
    the nuance that the speaker is nostalgic about (A), reminiscing about (A), or being introspective
    about (A). This means that it will not sound natural when describing things that are seemingly inconsequential,
    or have no meaningful significance.When highlighting things in the past that are not particularly
    important,たことがあるwill be used instead.
