    "writeup": "そこ is one of the forms of the それ family of words used to identify things close to the listener. In this case it demonstrates a place. Just like それ represents 'that', そこ represents 'that place', or simply 'there'.In the same way that それ can be used to point back to something that was mentioned previously, そこ can be used to point back to a place that was mentioned previously.Cautionそこ should not be confused with そっち, a similar word which is also sometimes translated as 'there'. そっち focuses more on the direction that one is/is going, while そこ focuses purely on 'that place'.",
