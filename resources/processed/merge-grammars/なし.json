    "writeup": "Although it is used almost exclusively as asuffix,なしis actually a noun that means ないこと 'thing without'.なし, or無し when using kanji, will be used after nouns that it is indicating as 'not having (A)'.Depending on what the speaker wants to convey,なしis often partnered with theauxiliary verbだ, or its conjunctive form で. なしで will mean '(A) that is without (B)'. When connected directly to another noun, の will be required afterなし. Again, this will mean '(A) that is without (B)'.なしdoes not always need to be connected directly to another noun. Often, it can be used in reference to an event or thing that someone wants to skip, or avoid. In cases like this, it may be paired with thecase marking particleに, to show determination to avoid something.Caution無し is quite different to抜き, another suffix-like structure that is used to convey 'without (A)'. The primary difference is in the original meanings of these words. Having a relationship with ない,なしsimply means 'without'.抜き comes from the う - Verb抜く 'to remove'. Due to this,抜き implies the intentional removal of something. Often抜き and無し are interchangeable, but not always.",
