    "writeup": "When any of theconjunction particlesthat carry the meaning of 'if' (たら,ば, orと) are paired with theい-Adjective,いい, they will express the desired result of the speaker. These all translate to 'it would be nice if (A)'. However, the speaker's level of certainty about the result being 'good' will change slightly, depending on the particle.ばいい- Hypothetically, (A) happening would be good. (Lowest strength/certainty)たらいい- When (A) happens, it will be good. (Medium strength/certainty)といい- The result of (A) is good. (Strongest/most certain)To useば,たら, orといい, first add the conjunction particle to the end of any verb, and then attach theい-Adjective,いい.",
