  writeup: もしかしたら and its alternatives are usually treated as stand alone副詞(adverbs) in Japanese that
    are used to present hypothetical situations, and what could happen within those situations. These
    expressions are a combination of the adverb若し, thecase marking particleか, and one of several combinations
    ofする(したら, して, or すると). It is often translated as 'perhaps', 'maybe', or 'possibly'.As with many other
    Japanese adverbs, it will often appear at the beginning of sentences. Due to もしかしたら presenting hypothetical
    situations,かもしれないwill regularly appear in the same sentence (although it is not required).As もしかしたら
    is a combination ofもし'if', か (presents a question), and したら 'so happens that', the literal translation
    is close to 'does it so happen that', or 'should it so happen that', with past or present tense being
    controlled more so by the following statement.
