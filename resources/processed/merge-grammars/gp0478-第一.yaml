  writeup: 第一is an expression in Japanese which may be used either as anadverb, or as anoun. As a noun,
    it will carry the meaning of 'foremost', or 'most important'. As an adverb, it can mean 'first', or
    'above anything'.To use第一adverbially, pair it withに. As a noun, it will usually be followed by の (when
    connecting nouns), or by theauxiliary verbだ, when at the end of a sentence.Occasionally, まず 'first
    of all' will be paired with第一. This may seem redundant, but is like saying 'the very first' in English.Fun
    Fact第is a kanji that is often translated as 'number'. However, the literal meaning is a bit closer
    to 'position', as it refers to the place that something has within a sequence of numbers. As such,第一simply
    means '1st position'.
