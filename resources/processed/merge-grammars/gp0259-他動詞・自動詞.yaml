  writeup: The two most fundamental divisions that can be made with Japanese verbs aretransitive verbs-
    the subject is moving/acting upon something else, andintransitive verbs- the subject themself is moving/acting.
    Sometimes these terms are simplified even further to 'other-move' (transitive), and 'self-move' (intransitive).Basically,
    this is the difference between verbs that require an object marked withを(transitive verbs), and those
    that only requireが, to show that the subject itself is moving (intransitive).In Japanese, there are
    many transitive/intransitive pairs of verbs, and these will need to be memorized.Fun FactIn Japanese,
    the two ways in which all verbs can be described are an act/motion  (動作), and an act/motion upon something
    (作用).Fun FactAlthough they are not traditionally grouped this way,するand なる may also be thought of
    as a transitive/intransitive pair. This is due toするalways implying that something is being controlled
    (acted upon), while なる always implies that something happens on its own, or cannot be controlled.
