  writeup: In order to express that you will (or someone else should) try something, the conjunction particleてwill
    be paired with見る (almost always without kanji). While this is translated as 'to try to (A)', the actual
    meaning is closer to 'to do (A), and see (whether the result is good or not)'.This grammar construction
    is usually only used when someone tries something for the first time.As mentioned above, this phrase
    is also used when suggesting that someone else should try something. In these situations, (A)+てみて,
    or more formally, (A)+てみてくださいwill be used.Sometimes, in very casual situations, even theてwill be dropped,
    and (A)+てみwill be used by itself. This usually has the nuance of 'come on, just give it a go!'CautionWhenてみたappears
    in the past tense, it will imply that the attempt was successful, unless specifically stated otherwise
    by the speaker.Fun FactWhile the kanji for見る may be used in this grammar point, it will result in
    the 'see' meaning being heavily stressed (rather than 'try'). This may cause a misunderstanding on
    the part of the person listening/reading.
