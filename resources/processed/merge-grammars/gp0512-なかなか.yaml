  writeup: なかなか(or中々in kanji) is anadverbin Japanese that is frequently translated as 'very', or 'considerably'.
    It is regularly paired directly with other adjectives, or before nouns (with の coming betweenなかなかand
    the noun).なかなかcan also sometimes have the nuance of being something that is軽視しがたい. This basically
    translates as 'difficult to dismiss', but is a bit closer to English expressions like 'nothing to
    scoff at', or 'not to be taken lightly'.Fun Factなかなかhighlights that something is 'considerably/extremely
    (A)', or 'far more (A) than expected'. If we imagine a dartboard, where the whole board shows the
    intensity level of a specific word, andなかなかrepresents the bullseye, this is basically the nuance.
    '(A) is the middle (bullseye) example of (B)'.Fun Factなかなか, coming from the kanji中meaning 'within',
    can be thought to mean the 'middle' or 'most' (A).
