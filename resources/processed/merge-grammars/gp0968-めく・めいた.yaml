  writeup: めくis a fairly unique う-Verb in Japanese in that it will only be used as asuffix. This is due
    to its meaning of 'to show signs of (A)', or 'to have the appearance of (A)'. It will be attached
    to nouns that the speaker experiences to be the case.Asめくitself is a verb, it may appear in several
    different conjugation forms depending on how it is describing the rest of the sentence. When connected
    directly to a second noun, the past-tense formめいたis most common.This 'that the speaker experiences
    to be the case' part is important, asめくwill almost always highlight the speaker's own personal feelings
    in regard to (A), and how they perceive it. The thing being described as (A) will usually not actually
    be (A), and the speaker is often aware of this fact.Caution -めくis mostly used with set nouns, so it
    is best to only use it with expressions that you have already heard. Some examples are謎めく'to appear
    to be a riddle',皮肉めく'to appear to be sarcastic',言い訳めく'to appear to be an excuse',作り物めく'to appear to
    be fictitious', and seasons of the year.
