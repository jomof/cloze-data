  writeup: In Japanese, theconjunctive formis often called 'the ます form', or 'the conjunctive form'. 'The
    conjunctive form' is much more accurate, as it is used with more than just verbs. Basically, theconjunctive
    formis the form of any word that will be used in standard conjugation with other structures. Forい-Adjectives,
    this is the form that uses く, for verbs, the ます stem.The reason thatconjunctive formis sometimes referred
    to as 'the formal conjunctive' is due to its use before a comma. Usually, theconjunction particleて
    would be used to separate clauses in sentences, however, the formal conjunctive allows this to be
    done without て. Let's look at some examples.As we can see, although て is not required, a読点(Japanese
    comma) will be required to prevent the sentence from becoming confusing.CautionThis type of conjugation
    is seen primarily in formal writing, and the standard て form will be heard much more frequently in
    daily speech.
