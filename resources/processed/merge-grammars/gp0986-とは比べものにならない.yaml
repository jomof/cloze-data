  writeup: In order to emphasize that something is far beyond what could possibly be compared to (A),
    the emphatic phraseとは比べものにならないwill be used.This is a combination of the case-marking particle と, theadverbial
    particleは, the neologism比べもの 'a comparable thing', the case-marking particle に, and the negated form
    of the う-Verb なる 'to become', ならない. This may seem like a lot, but it is just expressing that '(A)
    will not be a comparable thing'.This structure will be used before nouns, where that noun is the thing
    that cannot be compared. This is usually due to quality, quantity, or some other feature that is easily
    measurable.As this grammar pattern is emphatic, it will indicate that the difference between (A) and
    (B) is quite large, without specifically expressing the amount. Additionally, like in the final example,
    we can sometimes see the use of theadverbial particleは a second time before ならない. This just adds further
    emphasis or highlights contrast.Fun FactAs a reminder, a neologism is just a set word or phrase which
    has come to be used a certain way due to habits or customs.比べもの itself is just a mix of theconjunctive
    formof the る-Verb比べる 'to compare', and the noun もの 'thing'.
