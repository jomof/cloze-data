  writeup: へ行く is a common construction used when describing a place that someone/something is 'heading'.
    The particles に and へ are mostly interchangeable, but there is a slight difference in meaning. に has
    the nuance of 'going to', while へ has the nuance of 'heading to'.In these examples, while they may
    seem the same at first glance, へ focuses much more on the journey, while に puts more emphasis on the
    destination. This is true for other uses of に and へ as well. に will always put more focus on the destination
    of an action, where へ will put more emphasis on the distance traveled/between the origin and destination.

      english: To head to the station.
