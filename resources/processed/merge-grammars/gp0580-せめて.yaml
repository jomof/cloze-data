  writeup: Coming from the verb責める, meaning to have the 'onus to do (A)',せめてis anadverbthat indicates
    that doing (A) is the minimum expected in order to achieve some desired outcome. It is often translated
    simply as 'at least' in English.せめてusually alters the meaning of an entire phrase, and will appear
    at the beginning of sentences.Stemming from責める, this structure usually implies that there is some
    sort of onus or responsibility to do (A), rather than (A) simply being a minimum amount. Due to this,
    it is often used with grammar points that express desire or opinions such as たい, ほしい, てほしい, べき, and
    others.
