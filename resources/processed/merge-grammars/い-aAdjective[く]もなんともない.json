    "writeup": "When paired with theconjunctive formof い-Adjectives, く,もなんともないis often translated as 'not (A) or anything', or 'definitely not (A)'. This is a combination of theadverbial particleも and theadverb何ともない 'doesn't amount to anything'. なんともない is often grouped with other negative structures in order to show that the thing it is linked to is not a large amount or considerable extent.In many cases,何ともない illustrates that the extent of the thing that it follows is not sufficient to cause a problem. Because of this〜くもなんともないwill often be used in sentences where (A) is something that could potentially be an issue, but the speaker is expressing that it has not reached that point, or does not go that far. Because of this,〜くもなんともないis frequently used with adjectives that describe sensations or emotions.CautionThis structure is also commonly used with the auxiliary adjective たい, for showing that someone 'doesn't want to do (A)'.",
