  writeup: にとって (or に取って when appearing as kanji) is a structure in Japanese that is used to convey opinions,
    or just generally to discuss something from a particular perspective. This expression regularly appears
    after names/pronouns, but may also be used with regular nouns. にとって is often translated as 'to (A)',
    'for (A)', or 'concerning (A)'. However, it is used in almost exactly the same way as から見て 'from the
    perspective of (A)'.To use にとって, simply attach it to the end of a noun (or noun phrase) that you would
    like to express a certain viewpoint, judgment, or opinion from.Fun Factにとって comes from the verb取る
    'to take'. In this way, it literally means 'to take up (A)', where (A) is the location (standpoint)
    being highlighted with thecase marking particleに. Broadly, にとって has two main uses, these are as follows:の身として
    - From (A)'s standpoint. (When used about people)の立場から見て - When looking at it from (A). (When used
    about things)
