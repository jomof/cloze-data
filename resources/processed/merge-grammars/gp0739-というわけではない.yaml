  writeup: と言うわけではない is often considered an emphasized version of わけではない in stating that something 'doesn't
    mean that (A)', '(A) is not always the case', or 'it's not that (A)'. Being that という often presents
    (A) as a matter for discussion, or an important quotation structure, it will regularly be used to
    refer back to something that another person has said, in order to clarify that it may not be 100%
    accurate.というわけではない may be used after any structure that could usually be paired with という, and a more
    literal translation may be thought of as 'it is not so that (A) can be said'. Although not required,
    だ will often be seen before nouns and な-Adjectives, and というわけではない.と言うわけではない will regularly be used
    when the speaker is denying that something said earlier is the reason for something. This could either
    be a misunderstanding that they themselves want to avoid, or something that the listener asked them
    to clarify.Fun FactWhen used in the positive form, という訳だ is often attached to the end of statements
    that are considered to be either obvious, or clear due to context or common sense. This form will
    just be translated as 'so that means (A)', or 'so the reason is (A)'.
