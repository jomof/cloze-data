    "writeup": "と言えば, と言うと, and と言ったら are all expressions that are translated quite closely to 'speaking of (A)', or 'if it were the case that (A)'. Each of these structures has a slightly different nuance, but are largely used in the same situations.と言えば - More hypothetical, 'were it (A)'.と言うと - More concrete, 'if it's (A)'.と言ったら - More situational, 'when it's (A)'.These constructions are most commonly used after nouns, in response to something that has already been mentioned in the conversation (usually by someone else). The thing that has already been said is quite often the 'trigger' for someone remembering something, causing them to interject with と言えば.CautionAlthough these phrases are used in response to something that has already been mentioned, their purpose is to change the topic of the conversation somehow (or to add new information), rather than continuing along with the same subject.",
