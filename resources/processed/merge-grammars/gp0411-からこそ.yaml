  writeup: Traditionally, theadverbial particleこそ is used to emphasize whatever noun (or noun phrase)
    it is attached to. However, when combined with theconjunction particleから, it focuses on emphasizing
    the 'reason' for something. This structure is very similar to phrases like 'precisely because (A)'
    in English.からこそ is an expression that is primarily used after either verbs or nouns. In the case of
    nouns, the noun will need to be followed by theauxiliary verbだ, before からこそ is added.With からこそ, there
    may be several reasons for why something is the way it is, but こそ will show that there is a 'foremost'
    reason that should be considered before anything else.
