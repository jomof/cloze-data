  writeup: When used in succession,と言わずindicates that something is not limited to either (A) or (B), but
    applies to everything in a specific category or group. It may be translated as 'not just (A) or (B),
    but all', or '(A), (B) and everything else'. It is a combination of the case-marking particle と in
    itsquotationuse, the negative stem of言う,言わ, and the literary form of theclassical auxiliary verbぬ,
    ず. The literal translation is simply 'without saying (A), and without saying (B), (C)'. This 'without
    saying (A)' just means 'without limiting it to (A)'.This structure will follow both an (A) and a (B)
    noun before going on to explain what applies to everything.It will be important to remember that both
    (A) and (B) must be some part of a logical group when using this grammar structure, in order for it
    to sound natural. For example, the hands and the feet are part of the body, the morning and the afternoon
    are parts of a day, the chorus and the melody are parts of a song, etc.と言わず〜と言わずis a fairly formal
    expression, and will rarely be used in everyday speech.
