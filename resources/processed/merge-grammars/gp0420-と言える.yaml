  writeup: と言えるis a common expression that utilizes the potential form of the verb言う 'to say', to highlight
    that it is possible for something to be said. This phrase is often used to express a general idea
    about something that the speaker believes to be correct.と言えるtranslates as 'it is fair to say (A)',
    or 'one could say (A)'.As thecase marking particleと is being used in its引用(citation) use,と言えるmay follow
    any direct phrase/statement.と言える is regularly seen paired with grammar patterns likeだろう, orでしょう. This
    makes the overall statement more friendly, by considering the listener's thoughts about the issue
    being presented.と言えるだろうcan simply be translated as 'can we not say (A)?', or '(A) can be said, right?'.CautionWhen
    the potential form of言う is linked with theauxiliary verbよう, it creates a much stronger phrase that
    is similar to 'let it be said that (A)'.Fun FactThe speaker is usually relatively confident about
    their statement when using と言える, but the usage of a form that expresses conjecture shows that they
    are open to the possibility of being wrong, thus softening the tone.
