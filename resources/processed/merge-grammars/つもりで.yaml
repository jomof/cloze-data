  writeup: つもりで, being a combination of thenounつもり 'intention', and thecase marking particleで 'with',
    this structure is used in several different ways, depending on what comes before it. When combined
    with verbs, な-Adjectives or nouns in their plain forms, it implies that (B) is being done with the
    intention of (A).As つもり is a noun, の will be required before it when grouped with other nouns, while
    な will be required when linked to な-Adjectives.However, when paired with verbs in the past form,つもりでimplies
    that the speaker is 'acting as though (A)', 'pretending that (A)', or 'is convinced that (A)'.This
    meaning simply comes from the intention of something being contrary to what is actually true.
