  writeup: おかげで(or お陰で in kanji) is an expression that is used to show thanks or appreciation in Japanese.
    It is usually translated simply as 'thanks to (A)', or 'because of (A)'.おかげでis a combination of the
    politeprefixお, thenoun陰'shade', and thecase marking particleで.おかげで can be used after any word in itsattributive
    form.Literally,お陰でmeans 'in the shade of (A)'. This implies that (B) was only made possible due to
    (A) creating the ideal situation for it to occur.Cautionおかげで may sometimes be used sarcastically,
    in the same way as 'thanks to (A)' in English. In these sentences, it is usually quite clear from
    the context/tone of voice that the actual meaning is negative.Fun Factおかげで is often used at the beginning
    of a sentence in the same way as 'thankfully' or 'luckily' in English. This just means that whatever
    comes after おかげで happened, despite negative outcomes also being possible.
