  writeup: て初めて is an expression in Japanese that highlights one verb as being the catalyst for some particular
    result/state. Verb て初めて literally means 'with (A) done, for the first time (B)'. Often, this translates
    similarly to 'only after I (A) did I (B)', or 'not until (A) did I (B)'.In this structure, it should
    be noted that the (A) verb is not necessarily being done for the first time ever, just that this time
    resulted in the speaker's first experience of (B).CautionOriginally,始めて 'commencing with' and初めて 'starting
    with' were both used with this expression. However, this is considered incorrect in modern Japanese,
    as only初めて strictly carries the meaning of 'for the first time'.
