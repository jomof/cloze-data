  writeup: When paired with thecase marking particleに, ばかり regularly conveys the meaning of 'simply because',
    or 'just because'. Literally, this expression means that 'even with just (A), (B) is/was able to occur'.
    This phrase is regularly paired with the past form of verbs, indicating that something that has already
    taken place, led to some other result.To useばかりに, simply attach the expression to the end of any word
    in itsattributive form.It should be noted that this particular grammar pattern has a strong tendency
    to be used with results that are negative. However, this is not a requirement. A high level of eagerness/enthusiasm
    can also be expressed when paired with grammar points like たい, or ほしい.Fun FactAs we mention in our
    ばかり grammar point, one of the more common kanji that ばかり stems from is '許', which means to be 'let
    off' or 'let through'. It implies a minimum amount of something that is then deemed as 'permissible'.
    This nuance is kept in ばかりに, as the (A) part of the sentence is being highlighted as that minimum
    extent of something for which the (often surprising) result of (B) is/was possible. Due to this, translations
    such as 'even with only/just (A), (B)' are quite similar to ばかりに, so long as it is clear that (A)
    is surprising.Fun FactThe kanji that is used most frequently for ばかり is the same kanji that is used
    for許す 'to forgive'. In this particular use of 許, it still means 'to let off', or 'to let through',
    as 'to forgive' quite often has the nuance of letting something through/pass/slide.
