  writeup: だけでなく(an abbreviation ofだけではなく) is a common construction in Japanese which translates to 'not
    only (A), but also (B)'. Sometimes the (B) statement may be left unsaid. This expression may connect
    to any (A) phrase thatだけwould usually be able to connect to.CautionTheでinではis not the particleで, but
    theauxiliary verbだin itsconjunctive form.はis regularly dropped fromではexpressions, or it may also be
    changed toじゃ, for ease of pronunciation.Theconjunction particleてshould follow なく, as it is the conjunctive
    form of theい-Adjectiveない. However, theてin this particular construction is very often omitted.CautionIn
    writing, if there is no comma (known as a読点in Japanese) after なく, the fullなくてconstruction will be
    required. When a comma is present, both forms are grammatically correct.
