  writeup: 兼ねる, a る-Verb meaning 'to spread across' (usually 2 different activities or thought processes),
    often follows the ます-stem of other verbs in order to highlight that '(A) is not possible'. However,兼ねるoften
    indicates that the speaker would actually like to do (A), but cannot due to some external circumstances
    such as difficulty, already being busy, being hesitant, etc.This particular grammar pattern will most
    frequently be seen in its non-kanji form, although both are possible.兼ねるis somewhat formal, and may
    be used in cases where a phrase like できない would be considered too strong, so the speaker wants to
    lightly imply that (A) cannot be done.Fun-fact - As兼ねるmeans 'to spread across', this expression can
    be thought of as similar to 'to be a stretch' in English. It just indicates that doing the action
    of (A) would be a stretch of the speaker's ability or capacity.
