    "writeup": "When combined with theconjunction particleから,なぜなら(orなぜならば) forms a set pattern that can be translated as 'why (A), that is because (B)'. Essentially, it is a way to highlight that a 'because' is coming at the end of the sentence, drawing attention to it.なぜならitself is aconjunctionthat is a combination of theadverb, なぜ 'why', and thehypothetical formofだ,なら. Literally,なぜなら〜からis similar to 'why is (A) so, (B) is the cause'. This sounds quite dramatic in English, but is a perfectly natural way of emphasizing a statement/fact in Japanese.To useなぜなら〜から, state that fact/important piece of information as (A). Then, at the beginning of a new sentence,なぜならwill be followed by the reason/cause, with から finishing the sentence.The primary function ofなぜならin Japanese (as opposed to simply using から orのでby itself) is to gain the attention of the listener, and inform them that important information is coming.",
