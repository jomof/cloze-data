  writeup: When the particle つつ 'while doing' is combined with ある 'to be', it indicates that someone or
    something is in the ongoing process of (A). (A) will be a verb in its ます-stem form. This formal grammar
    structure primarily highlights that (A) is slowly but surely continuing or changing. This 'change'
    is often in regard to an increase, decrease, expansion, contraction, or something similar.This pattern
    can be translated simply as 'to be (A)ing'.Caution - Compared to ている,つつあるtends not to be used in relation
    to noticably physical motions, but rather highlights actions that indicate an ongoing state of change
    (such as the blooming of a flower), rather than simply 'continuing'. This is especially true for verbs
    that have an obvious end or completion point.
