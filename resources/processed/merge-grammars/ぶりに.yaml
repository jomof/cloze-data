  writeup: When used as asuffix, the voiced form of振り 'style',振り will be used to indicate either the way
    something appears, or some specific lapse of time since the last time something happened. This can
    be translated as 'for the first time in (A)', or 'haven't done (B) for (A) time'.As ぶり (appearing
    most often in hiragana) is asuffix, it will be used after nouns. When followed by に, the part (B)
    portion of the sentence will give more information about what wasn't done for the period of (A). Additionally,
    ぶり may be followed by の when attached directly to a second noun that is being modified by ぶり.Caution
    - Although it is not incorrect, it may be considered unnatural to use ぶり in situations where the interval
    of time is not significant, such as with minutes, seconds, and hours.
