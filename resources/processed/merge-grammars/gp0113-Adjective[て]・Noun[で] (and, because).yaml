  writeup: The て form of an い-Adjective , or で form of a noun (or な-Adjective ) is exactly the same as
    the て form of a verb, in that it carries the meaning of 'and', and is used for linking. It will allow
    us to list multiple qualities/traits of something.For い-Adjectives , we will need to change the last
    い to く (the form used for conjugation), and then simply add て .For nouns and な-Adjectives , we will
    need to add で to the base form (not な or だ ).It should be noted that て and で are different structures
    here. て is the same conjunction particle that is used with verbs (meaning that い-Adjectives are similar
    to verbs), while で is actually a form of だ that is used for conjugation. It is the same で as the one
    that is used in the formal version of だ , である . Which we will learn later.CautionLike other て forms
    ( ている 1 , ている 2 , and ている 3 ), the て (or で ) form of other words can have several possible meanings.
    These meanings are as follows.Linking - Like 'and' in English.Reasons - Like 'with (A)', or 'because
    of (A)' in English.Manner - Like 'to do (B) in an (A) way' in English.CautionAs with all other conjugations
    of いい , remember that it will be よくて, and not いくて.
