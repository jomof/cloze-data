  writeup: わざわざ is anadverbthat is used to express when someone has gone out of their way to achieve a
    certain result. It may be translated as 'expressly', 'especially', or 'to go out of one's way to (A)'.わざわざ
    will usually be used at the beginning of sentences, before some statement will be made about an activity
    that was intentionally done.わざわざ has a tendency to be used positively, although it may be used with
    negative connotations as well.Fun FactAlthough almost never used,態態may be seen in this kanji form.態is
    a kanji used to express 'purpose', or 'intent'. Generally, it refers to someone's 'willingness' to
    do something. As such, わざわざ just expresses that (A) is something that the speaker has as a strong
    goal. How it will be translated depends more on whether the actual result is positive, negative, or
    undecided.Positive result - To purposefully do (A), with the result of (A).Negative result - To have
    every intention of (A), with the actual result of (B).Undecided result - To be intent on (A), with
    (A) hopefully happening.Cautionわざと is a construction that comes from the same kanji as わざわざ. わざと generally
    only conveys 'on purpose', while わざわざ has many more potential meanings (due to being stronger).
