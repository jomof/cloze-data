  writeup: Coming from the こそあど言葉family of words,こう,そう,ああ, orどうmay be used with the verb言う to form an
    expression which literally means 'in the way of (A)'. (A) being 'this'これ, 'that'それ, 'that over there'あれ,
    or 'what'どれ(in questions). As with all pre-noun adjectival words, this expression will be used directly
    before a noun.Althoughこう,そう,ああ, andどうshare a relationship withこれ,それ,あれ, andどれ, they are their own
    individual words, which each have a meaning similar to 'as such'. These words are alladverbwhen used
    by themselves.Cautionそう(the adverb), should not be confused withそう, the auxiliary verb.そう(the adverb)
    comes from the kanji然う, while theauxiliary verbdoes not have a kanji form.
