  writeup: は (pronounced わ) is often considered to be one of the most difficult particles to master in
    Japanese, alongside が . は marks the topic of the sentence, and describes the whole sentence broadly.
    However, が primarily marks single actions or statements. We will explore this distinction in more
    detail when covering が .In many sentences (especially short ones), either は or が would be considered
    perfectly natural. This depends on whether someone is simply stating something ( は ), or highlighting
    it especially ( が ).In the first sentence, は broadly describes what the sentence is about (curry).
    In the second sentence, は again describes the whole sentence being about 'me', but が highlights one
    specific piece of information (wine being the thing that is hated).Cautionは cannot be used to describe
    things that you are seeing or experiencing 'in the moment' (right now). This is due to 'in the moment'
    events being considered part of a larger experience (your whole day for example).Cautionは has 2 main
    functions. The first marks the topic of the sentence, the second is used for contrast or making comparisons.
    Although there are no 'strict' rules for this, when は is used toward (or after) the middle of a sentence,
    it will usually have the nuance of contrast.In the second sentence, は will give the listener the impression
    that there is a comparison being made.
  examples:
    - japanese: 今はテスト。
      english: I have a test now. (Slightly unnatural, as the test is happening 'right now')
    - japanese: 今日は、雨。
      english: It will rain today. (Natural, as rain is a fairly broad event)
    - japanese: 私は、金曜日が好き。
      english: I like Fridays. (Focus is on Friday)
    - japanese: 私は、金曜日は好き。
      english: I like Fridays. (Focus is on the comparison to other days)
    - japanese: 私はトムです。
      english: I (as the topic of this sentence) am Tom.
    - japanese: あなたはジムです。
      english: You (as the topic of this sentence) are Jim.
    - japanese: トムは先生です。
      english: Tom (as the topic of this sentence) is a teacher.
    - japanese: カレンダーは必要です。
      english: A calendar (as the topic of this sentence) is necessary.
    - japanese: 私は忙しいです。
      english: I (as the topic of this sentence) am busy.

  writeup: '## 1. The origin of は can be traced to the conditional marker ば. (Compare the spellings of
    は and ば) (⇨ ば) However, in contemporary Japanese, は is used, in general, to mark information which
    the speaker assumes to be part of the hearer''s register. In other words, when は marks X, the speaker
    usually assumes that the hearer knows what X refers to. Thus, noun phrases which can be marked by
    は in ordinary circumstances are as follows:'
