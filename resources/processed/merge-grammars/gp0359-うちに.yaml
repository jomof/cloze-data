  writeup: When うち, (sometimes seen using the kanji内, or裡) is paired with thecase marking particleに, it
    expresses a period/space 'within' which something else will/should happen/exist. It quite often (but
    not always) carries the nuance of (A) being the 'best', or the 'optimal' time/space within which (B)
    could occur/exist. In English,うちにcan simply be translated as 'while', or 'during'.うちにmay be paired
    with the ている form of verbs, the plain form ofい-Adjectives, nouns followed by の, orな-Adjectivesthat
    are followed by な.Unlike間に,うちにexpresses something that can happen/exist anywhere 'within' the span
    of (A), and is therefore non-specific as to where (B) is located.Fun FactThe kanji裡refers literally
    to the inner walls/lining of something, and anything that is enclosed within that space. This can
    be thought of as where the 'non-specificity' of うち comes from, in regard to where within that space
    something is.
