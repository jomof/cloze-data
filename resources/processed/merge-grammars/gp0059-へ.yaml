  writeup: へ is a particle used when describing a place that someone or something is 'moving toward',
    or 'in contact with'. In many cases, the particles に and へ are interchangeable, but there is a slight
    difference in meaning. へ focuses more on the distance/effort required to get between (A) and (B),
    while に focuses more on the connection between (A) and (B). へ always comes after the noun signifying
    the destination.In these examples, while they may seem the same at first glance, へ shows that there
    is a space between (A) and (B), while に puts the emphasis solely on the destination. This is why common
    expressions such as 'city/country name へ ようこそ' sound very polite. It is like saying 'Welcome, and
    we acknowledge your journey/effort to get here'.In the TV-show example, this commonly means 'thank
    you for your effort to watch this particular show, out of all the ones you could have chosen'.

    - japanese: 私は電車で大阪へ行く。
      english: I go to Osaka by train.
    - japanese: 神戸へ行く。
      english: To go to Kobe.
    - japanese: 家へ帰る。
