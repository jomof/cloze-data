  writeup: 序に is anadverbin Japanese that is used in a similar way to 'while you're at it', or 'on the
    occasion of (A)' in English.序itself is a noun that means 'precedence' (in terms of being the first
    thing to happen). Due to this, the literal meaning of序に may be thought of as 'with (A) as the precedence,
    (B)'.序に is commonly used with verbs, or nouns. In the case of nouns, it will need to be preceded by
    thecase marking particleの.Fun FactJust like 'precedence' in English,序に implies that (A) is the instigator
    for (B). Because of this,序に is a good way to convey that something is not urgent, but, if (A) is happening,
    it is the perfect chance to do (B) as well.Caution序に is more formal than間にor時に, so has more of a tendency
    to be used for 'one-off' things, rather than regular occurrences. Despite this, it still may be used
    to describe regular occurrences at times, especially when speaking formally or politely, such as to
    a senpai.
