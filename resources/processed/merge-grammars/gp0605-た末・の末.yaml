  writeup: Appearing with verbs in their past form, or grouped with nouns after の is末, a word meaning
    'end tip'. に will follow末, marking the 'tip' as the point from which something will result.While this
    grammar pattern is usually translated as 'after (A), (B)', or 'as a result of (A), (B)', the nuance
    is on various things having happened along the way, and then finally reaching the 'point' or 'conclusion'
    of (A).末にmay highlight either positive or negative results, but will suggest that some long-lasting
    effort or struggle eventually resulted in (B).
