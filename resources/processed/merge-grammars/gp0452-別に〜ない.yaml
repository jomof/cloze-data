  writeup: When paired with ない (either theい-Adjectiveor the auxiliary verb), theadverb別に 'separately'
    changes slightly in definition to that of特に 'especially'. Let's have a look at a few examples.This
    'especially' nuance of別に comes from 'separately' being negated. The literal meaning of別に〜ない is something
    like '(A) cannot be separated/differentiated'. This comes across as 'maybe it is a little (A), maybe
    a lot (A), but in any case, it cannot be said that it IS (A)'.Caution別に will quite often be paired
    withわけではない, as they both express uncertainty. However, it should never be paired withわけがない, as this
    would be combining a statement that removes certainty, with one that adds certainty.
