  writeup: どれ is from the same family of words as これ , それ , and あれ . These words are called こそあど 言葉 in
    Japanese. Unlike the other 3, which all point to a specific thing, words starting with ど are designed
    for enquiring about something unknown. どれ can roughly be translated as 'which' in English, and is
    used for enquiring about a group (of 3 or more things).From these examples, we can see that the particle
    が is often used with どれ , especially when preceding questions. However, when どれ follows a noun, は
    will be used.When there are only two choices to select between, どちら+の ,  or どっち+の will be used instead
    of どれ . This is a habit that has become part of the language over time, and was not originally how
    these words were used.
  examples:
    - japanese: どれがいいですか。
      english: Which is good?
    - japanese: どれでもいいです。
      english: Whichever is fine.
    - japanese: どれを選びますか。
      english: Which will you choose?
    - japanese: どれが好きですか。
      english: Which do you like?
    - japanese: どれでも好きだ。
      english: I like whichever。
