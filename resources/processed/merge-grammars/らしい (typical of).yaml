  writeup: In our firstらしいlesson, we discussed theauxiliary verbuse ofらしい. In this lesson we will focus
    on the形容詞の一部(auxiliary adjective) usage. An auxiliary adjective is a type of adjective that must be
    attached to another word for it to have any meaning.To useらしいin this way, it must be attached to the
    end of a noun, and will imply that something is 'typical of (A)', where (A) is the noun that comes
    before it. As thisらしいbehaves like anい-Adjective, it may also be conjugated toらしく, before a (B) phrase
    will explain more about 'what' is/was typical of (A).The primary use of thisらしいis to express that
    (A) has some feature or trait that is expected of itself. It can be used for people, 'studying all
    night is so typical of Tanaka', or it can be used for things like seasons 'this heat is so typical
    of the Japanese Summer'. Other common translations are 'to be befitting of (A)', or 'to be appropriate
    for (A)'.However, it may also be used negatively, to show that something is (often surprisingly) 'uncharacteristic
    of (A)'.Fun FactWhen the noun that appears in (A) and (B) are the same, it will imply that (A) is
    the 'prime example of (B)', or 'the most (A), (B)'.
