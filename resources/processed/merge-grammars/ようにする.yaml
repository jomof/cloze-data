  writeup: (A)ようにするis an expression in Japanese which combines theauxiliary verbようだ, withする(indicating
    that you will 'try' to do something). Asようだis being linked to the verbする, it will take on its adverbial
    form,ように. This structure emphasizes that the (A) action (always a verb) is something that the speaker
    is going out of their way to do, and implies effort.Naturally, this structure may also be used with
    a negative verb, to imply that (A) being done is something that is actively being avoided. This translates
    as 'to make sure not to do (A)'.Fun FactBecauseようだcomes from the kanji様'manner', it carries the nuance
    that the 'way' that someone is doing (A) is specifically in a way that has success as the goal. Literally
    it translates quite closely to 'to do (A) in the manner of getting it done', and therefore just strengthens
    the (A) action, by using 'to do' twice.
