  writeup: 何か and 何も are constructions that are used in Japanese for expressing 'something', 'anything',
    or 'nothing'. The main difference between the two being that 何も is used with negative phrases (phrases
    that use ない or ありません ), while 何か is used in other cases.To use this expression, we simply need to
    put 何か or 何も before the desired phrase.CautionThere are several casual forms of these expressions
    that are used in speech, or in certain dialects. These forms are なんにか , なんか , or なんにも , なんも .
  examples:
    - japanese: 私がなにか嫌な ことをしましたか?
      english: Did I do something you didn't like?
    - japanese: いいえ、なにもしていませんよ。
      english: No, I didn't do anything (wrong).
    - japanese: 日本に行って、なにか食べたいものがありますか。
      english: When you go to Japan, is there something that you want to eat?
