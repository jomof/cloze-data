  writeup: ばそれまでだis a hypothetical expression used when one wishes to indicate that ‘if (A) is reached,
    that’s as far as it will go’. This usually indicates that everything up to that point will unfortunately
    go to waste. Standard translations include ‘if (A), then it’s all been in vain’, ‘if (A), then all
    is a waste’, or ‘if (A), then there’s no point.Although verbs combining with theconjunction particleば
    is thestandard formof this grammar structure. Theconjunction particleたら may also occasionally be used.Frequently
    this grammar structure will be seen in sentences that include ても or でも in the first half, withばそれまでだcoming
    closer to the end. This indicates that ‘even if (A), if also (B), then there’s no point’.Cautionと言われればそれまでだis
    a set expression that means ‘while it is true that (A), (B)’, or ‘although certainly (A), (B)’. It
    is often used for politely expressing one’s personal opinion in relation to something. This phrase
    literally means ‘if It were to be said that it was (A), then that’s all there is to it, but (B)’.
