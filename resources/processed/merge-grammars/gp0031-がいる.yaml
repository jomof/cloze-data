  writeup: がいる is a common construction that is simply a combination of the が particle, and the verb いる
    . This expression means 'to exist', or 'there is', and is used in relation to living/animate things.Because
    the things being described in these examples are considered to be alive (or operated by something
    that is alive), いる is the verb that will be used. ある is used for non-living things.The polite form
    of いる conjugates as います . Due to the る being removed, we can determine that いる is a る-Verb (Ichidan
    verb) .The kanji form of 居る is quite common, and should be learned as early as possible to save any
    confusion while reading. There is no nuance difference between this expression being used with or
    without kanji, and is up to the preference of the writer.CautionThe が in がいる is often omitted in casual
    speech, or writing that behaves like casual speech (manga, instant messaging, etc).
