  writeup: ときたらis an expression used casually when expressing mild frustration toward (A) in a lighthearted
    manner. This structure is a combination of the case-marking particle と, and来る combined with theconjunction
    particleたら 'if',来たら. It will often simply be translated as 'that blasted (A)', or 'that damn (A)'.
    Despite this, the literal meaning is just 'when it comes to (A)'.ときたらwill directly follow nouns.This
    grammar pattern will almost exclusively appear in kana, so memorizing the stem verb it comes from
    will help to remember the meaning.Fun FactIn line with the literal meaning of 'when it comes to (A)',ときたらmay
    also be used when the speaker wants to highlight something about (A) that is 'to be expected', or
    'only natural'. Determining whetherときたらis being used in this way, or to express frustration, is usually
    quite clear in the second half of the statement.Despite having two almost opposite nuances, it may
    help to think ofときたらas just 'when it comes to (A)' in all situations, with the (B) part of the phrase
    indicating whether it is positive or negative.
