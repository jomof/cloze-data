  writeup: に則ってis a formal expression used when something is being done 'according to (A)', or 'in line
    with (A)'. This is usually some basis, foundation, or standard which has a long running history. The
    case-marking particle に is being combined with the て-form of the う-Verb則る 'to follow along with' in
    this grammar pattern. Based on this, the literal meaning is just that (B) is something that follows
    along with (A).While several forms may be seen, the most common are a noun followed byにのっとって, or a
    noun followed byにのっとったwhich will then modify a second noun.Both the kanji form and the plain hiragana
    form are quite common, so it will be helpful to remember both.As (A) is generally considered to be
    something that has some kind of foundation. It will mostly represent a thing that has some kind of
    inception point from which point little, if anything, changed. Some examples are laws, traditions,
    standards, codes of conduct, etc.
