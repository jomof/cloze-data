  writeup: い is a sentence-ending particle in Japanese that will often be seen in compound structures
    with other particles, or auxiliary verbs. It adds a sense of familiarity and friendliness to the base
    meaning of what it is being paired with.い is usually only used by men, when speaking to someone of
    a lower social position. This social position difference is more in reference to age than anything
    else, so い being used when an elderly person is speaking to a younger person is very common.This feeling
    of familiarity is best conveyed when い is paired with the sentence-ending particle か, or the auxiliary
    verb だ.い may also be paired with more emphatic sentence-ending particles such as わ, や, and ぞ, or the
    auxiliary verb た. However, these combinations are far less common, and won't be seen very often.CautionDespite
    い primarily being used by men, it is not a strict rule, and women do occasionally use it. This is
    especially true when partnered with either か, だ, or わ.CautionAlthough uncommon, い can also be used
    with the imperative form of verbs to create a slightly less strict sounding order or command.Once
    again, this use is very rare, and will almost never actually be used in real life. It may, however,
    appear in books.
