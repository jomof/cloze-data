  writeup: とき , or 時 in kanji, is a noun that is regularly used to signify 'when' something happened (a
    verb). However, unlike some other time expressions, とき is mainly used to express things that happen
    at regular intervals (habits, hobbies, etc.), or at broad times/individual events (when it rains,
    when there is a sale at the shop, etc.)Using とき is quite easy! You just need to attach it to the end
    of any independent word (verbs, nouns, or adjectives). As with most cases where a noun will be attached
    to another word in Japanese, we will also be required to use な after な-Adjectives , and の after nouns.
    The case-marking particle に will generally come directly after 時 , signifying that another verb is
    about to follow.CautionAs discussed previously, ときに is primarily used to discuss when things happened.
    What this means is that it will not be used to highlight ongoing states that were true during the
    first action. For example 'the time you tripped over a log on Tuesday'.When とき is used, the nuance
    will be that it is describing one thing leading to another, rather than a static thing.
  examples:
    - japanese: 学校から家に帰った時に火曜日だった。(Unnatural Japanese)
      english: The time when I was going home from school was Tuesday. (Tuesday is a state, rather than
        an action, so とき will not be used to express something like this)
    - japanese: 俺は高校生の時に俺が好きな女の子に告白して、「え、無理...」って言われた。
      english: When I was in highschool I asked out a girl I liked, and she said 'umm, no way…' (時 is
        describing the broad event of 'being a highschool student', while て is goes on to describe another
        single event that happened during that time.
    - japanese: 散歩をするときに音楽を聴く。
      english: I listen to music when I take a walk.
    - japanese: 私はカラオケに行くときに幸せな気持ちになります。
      english: When I go to karaoke I feel happy.
    - japanese: 授業のときは静かにしなくてはいけない。
      english: When you are having class, you have to be quiet.
    - japanese: あの映画を見たとき、泣いた。
      english: When I watched that movie, I cried.
    - japanese: 大変なときに彼の親は亡くなった。
      english: His parents died when he was going through a difficult time.
