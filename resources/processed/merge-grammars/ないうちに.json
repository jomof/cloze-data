    "writeup": "In contrast to うちに, which is often used to express the 'optimal', or 'best' time within which something should occur,ないうちにexpresses the time within which something 'does not' occur, and results in (or causes) something negative, or will cause something negative if not dealt with. This means that 'before (A) happens (B)', or 'without (A) happening, (B).うちに will be paired with verbs in their ない (negative) form, before the (B) phrase highlights something that 'is done to prevent (A) from happening', or 'happened unfortunately during (A)'.Fun Fact前にandないうちにare used in very similar situations, with the primary difference being thatないうちにfocuses more on unfavorable results.",
