  writeup: Being a combination of the particles と and か,とか'quotes' the previous statement as being something
    that has been heard, but is unconfirmed or uncertain. In English, this translates as 'I heard something
    like (A)', or '(A) or something was said'.とかmay appear after verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, or
    nouns.This meaning of 'or something' when usingとかis fairly casual and will often be heard in everyday
    conversation.Caution - This combination of と and か may appear the same as the とか used to indicate
    lists, but the former is simply a combination of the case-marking particle と, and theadverbial particleか,
    while the latter is a singlelisting particle. Despite this, both structures are originally combinations
    of と and か, and may be thought to have some overlap in meaning.

  writeup: '## 1. The conjunction とか is a combination of the quote marker と3 and か1. That is why とか is
    often followed by the verb 言う ''say'', as in Example (a). When とか is followed by 言う, as in (1), it
    is not a conjunction; it is a quote marker. The か indicates the speaker''s uncertainty about the quoted
    report.'
