  writeup: けis asentence ending particlein Japanese that is used to convey when the speaker is trying
    to either remember, or confirm information that they have forgotten. In this way, it is very similar
    to the 'again' in 'what is (A) again?'けmay only be used after the past form of theauxiliary verbsだ
    or た. This means that け (should) only be seen as だっけ or たっけ.It is also common to see のだ and んだ utilized
    to make verb tenses a possibility.CautionDespite the grammar rules related toっけ, the younger generation
    quite often uses it without the addition of んだ (especially with verbs).While it is important to understand
    that this is stillっけ, it is not a grammatically correct form that may be used in writing (or formal
    speaking).Fun Factけ will sound equally natural when asking a rhetorical question to yourself, or when
    directly asking another person about something that you have forgotten.
