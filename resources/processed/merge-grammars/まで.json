    "writeup": "Theadverbial particleまでis used in the same way as many other adverbial particles, in that it is highlighting that the statement that comes after it as important in some way. However, unlike our first look atまで, which discussed its use as 'until', this use ofまでhas the nuance of 'even', or 'to the extent'. It can be used after verbs or nouns.Although usingまでas 'even' may seem different to 'until', they are essentially the same thing in Japanese. This is becauseまでalways means '(A)まで, (B)', where (A) is the 'limitation/extent', and (B) is the 'noteworthy factor'. This 'noteworthy factor' will usually be a descriptive word/phrase, such as a verb, adjective, or explanation.Fun FactTheもparticle is sometimes grouped together withまで, when the meaning is 'even'. This just adds emphasis to the fact that the event is somewhat surprising, or that the result is satisfying.",
