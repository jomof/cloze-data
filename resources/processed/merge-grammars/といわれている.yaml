  writeup: といわれているis often translated as 'to be said that (A)', or 'it is known that (A)'. Likeとされている,
    it is another construction that links thecase marking particleと, with the passive form of another
    verb, to mark a commonly held/public opinion. The verb in this case being言う.However, unlikeとされているwhich
    expresses a 'result',といわれているexpresses引用a 'quotation'. To useといわれている, add it to the end of a phrase
    that you would like to express as being a common thing that is said.This particular grammar point
    is regularly seen both with, and without the kanji for言う, as the meaning will not change depending
    on its usage.
