  writeup: 並みis the noun form of the classical verb並む, which has the same meaning as並ぶ, ‘to line up’,
    or ‘to be in line’. It will be used following nouns, and may be interpreted as ‘on par with (A)’,
    ‘worthy of (A)’, or ‘as standard for (A)’. However, the literal translation of ‘in line with (A)’
    also works just as well in many cases.CautionAlthough並みmay occasionally have the meaning of ‘as standard
    for (A)’ as a suffix, the ‘average’ or ‘ordinary’ meaning is often reserved for when並みis used by itself
    as a noun. In these cases it will usually be written as並, and be followed by thecase-marking particleの,
    and then a second noun marking what the average is.Caution並みmay only be used in sentences where (A)
    has a standard or norm that is well recognized, or easily identifiable. In cases where the ‘norm’
    would change based on an individual’s opinion, rather than what the actual standard is, it will sound
    unnatural.
