    "writeup": "そうだis one of the 18 primaryauxiliary verbsin Japanese, and can be used in two (2) different ways. The broad meaning in each of its applications is that something 'seems' to be a certain way. Due to this,そうis regularly translated as 'seems like', 'looks like', or 'appears as though'.In this lesson, we will focus on the form that is used with the conjunctive (stem) form of words. Please examine the structure guide to see these forms.Cautionそうmay also be used when attached to theい-Adjective, ない. In this case, there is a unique conjugation rule which we will need to be careful of. As always, い will be removed from ない before attachingそう. However, さ will be inserted between な, andそう. This creates the expression なさそう.Note that this addition of さ does not happen with verbs. This is due to the ない that is used with negative verbs being anauxiliary verb,  and not anい-Adjective. With theauxiliary verbない, simply remove the い, before addingそうdirectly to the stem.CautionThisそうis utilized exclusively to make predictions/guesses about something based on visual information. It is relatively low confidence, so should not be used for things that are obvious. In these cases,みたいwould be used instead.",
