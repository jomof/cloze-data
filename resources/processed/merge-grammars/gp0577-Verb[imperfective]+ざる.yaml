  writeup: ざる is the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb ず. It keeps the same negation 'not'
    meaning as ず, and will conjugate with verbs in the same way as ない. ざる will also often be translated
    as 'un~', like in 'unstoppable'.In most cases, ざる will be seen attached to verbs that are describing
    a noun that comes directly after them.Although ざる may be used in place of ない, in modern Japanese it
    is primarily only seen as part of common expressions or sayings, such as the ざるを得ない 'have no choice
    but to (A)' grammar structure.Caution - As with many old-fashioned grammar patterns, ざる will conjugate
    with the せ stem of する, rather than the more modern し stem.Fun-fact - Some dictionaries list ざる as
    the attributive form of the classical auxiliary verb ざり. However, ざり itself is just a contraction
    of ず and あり 'to be'. Due to this, both variations may be considered as correct, with ず being the underlying
    origination.
