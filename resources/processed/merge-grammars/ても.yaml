  writeup: The combination of the conjunction particleて(or the case-marking particleで), with theadverbial
    particleも, often has the nuance of 'even if (A)', or 'even though (A)'.To use this structure, simply
    conjugate a verb orい-Adjectiveinto itsて-form, and then addも.For nouns andな-Adjectives,でもwill be used
    instead.This grammar pattern may also be used for highlighting negative sentences, and will translate
    similarly to 'even if not (A)', or 'even though not (A)' in these cases.Fun Factでも(the form after
    nouns andな-Adjectives) is often considered to be anadverbial particleitself, and there is often debate
    amongst native speakers as to whetherでもis actually a word, or simply a standard grouping ofで, thecase
    marking particleandも, theadverbial particle. However, It may be easier to rememberでもas its own word,
    for learning purposes.
