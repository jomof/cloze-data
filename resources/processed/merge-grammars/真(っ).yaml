  writeup: Theprefixま, coming from the kanji真(true), is attached to words in Japanese to express that
    something is 'completely', 'exactly', 'genuinely' (A). Depending on the word that follows真, several
    different conjugation patterns will be used. This conjugation depends on which column the first kana
    of the word after真comes from. ま comes from the ま, み, む, め, も column, for example.When linked with
    a ま column, or な column word,真will become真ん.When linked with a か column, さ column, or しゃ sound word,真will
    become真っ.When linked with a は column,真will become真っ, and the first kana of the following word will
    change to a 'P' sound.CautionThere are several exceptions to the standard changes that happen when
    using真as aprefix. These are as follows.When linked with青い,真will become真っ, and青い will become青.When
    linked with赤い,真will become真っ, and赤い will become赤.
