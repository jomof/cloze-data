  writeup: A predicate is a word that describes the topic/subject of a sentence. The Japanese equivalent
    of this is a 述語 , which literally means 'statement word'. As a predicate , い-Adjectives can appear
    by themselves (when the word they are describing does not need to be stated), or they may be used
    at the end of a sentence.When there are no other words apart from the adjective itself, it comes across
    similar to 'It's cute', or 'It's hot', and similar expressions in English. We just have to guess what
    the 'it' is from context.In many sentences, either は or が could be used to mark the word/words that
    the predicate is describing. However, which one sounds more natural will depend on many factors. In
    general, if you are specifically pointing out something as being different from other things in the
    same category, が will be used.In this example, が is distinguishing this specific bath as having a
    unique level of hotness compared to others (maybe the water system is broken and only boiling water
    comes out). は would sound unnatural in this type of sentence, as it is not the 'normal' state of the
    bath.Fun FactAll い-Adjectives are words of Japanese origin.
  examples:
    - japanese: 暑い。暑いです。
      english: It is hot.
    - japanese: 寒い。寒いです。
      english: It is cold.
    - japanese: これは楽しい。これは楽しいです。
      english: This is fun.
    - japanese: 猫はかわいい。猫はかわいいです。
      english: Cats are cute.
    - japanese: 私の家は近い。私の家は近いです。
      english: My house is near (by).
