  writeup: っぽい(occasionally also seen as ぽい) is asuffixthat may be attached to many different types of
    words, in order to create newい-Adjectives. In all cases,っぽいindicates something that is 'exhibiting
    characteristics of (A)'. This is most often in reference to the way (A) is acting, or the way (A)
    looks. In English,っぽいmay be translated as '(A)ish', '(A)like', or 'tendency to (A)'.っぽいquite often
    carries a negative connotation.Asっぽいcreatesい-Adjectivesfrom other words, it may be used with theconjunctive
    formof verbs, or the語幹(stem form) of any other word.CautionAsっぽいcreates newい-Adjectives,っぽいitself
    may be conjugated in exactly the same way as regularい-Adjectives.CautionThe fundamental meaning ofっぽいwill
    change depending on what type of word it is being used with. The general rules are as follows:Verb+っぽい-
    To have a tendency to do (A).Adjective+っぽい- To exhibit all the signs of being (A).Noun+っぽい- To obviously
    not be (A), although show signs of being (A).From this, we can see thatっぽいis generally based on the
    opinion of the speaker, rather than the innate qualities of what is being observed. Thus, with verbs,
    adjectives, and nouns, the speaker feels like (A) is in excess, compared to what would be expected.
    This 'being in excess of what is normal' in the opinion of the speaker is what creates the negative
    connotation.
