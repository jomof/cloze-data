  writeup: The nounところ(sometimes shortened toとこ) is often used to describe the 'place' or 'situation'
    in which something happens. The primary determining factor for the nuance ofところ, is the tense of the
    verb it follows. When it is in the non-past form,ところmeans 'about to (A)', or 'on the verge of (A)'.CautionWhen
    the kanji form of所is used, it is often referring to an actual physical location, rather than a situation/standpoint.
    However, this is something that native speakers will sometimes mistake. Therefore, seeing the kanji
    form, and the hiragana form, are both relatively common.
