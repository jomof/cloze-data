  writeup: Used to express that something is 'slightly (A)', 'somewhat (A)', or 'in some respects (A)'
    in Japanese is the phraseなくはない. This is comprised of ない in its なく (conjunctive) form connected to
    either verbs or nouns, は, and ない. The literal meaning of this structure is close to 'it's not that
    it isn't (A)', and is a type of double negative.Although preceded mostly by verbs, this structure
    sometimes appears following nouns. When that is the case, が, は, or sometimes even に may be betweenなくはないand
    the noun. Additionally, the は inなくはないis interchangeable with も, with only a slight strengthening of
    the nuance when も is used.This structure often appears with the potential form of verbs, in order
    to show that something is not impossible, despite appearances or what one may think.
