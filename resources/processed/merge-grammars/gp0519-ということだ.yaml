  writeup: Like ということ, an expression used for nominalizing a phrase in the fashion of 'the ~ that ~',ということだmakes
    use of theauxiliary verbだ(orです), and stresses that the nominalized phrase 'is' the case. This phrase
    is often translated as 'I heard that', or 'it is said that', but literally, it is closer to 'it is
    that it's ~'. Theだis what gives this expression a high degree of certainty, therefore implying that
    the speaker has heard the statement elsewhere, and is sure of its validity.ということだcan be added to the
    end of any phrase that the speaker wants to highlight as being something that is known.ということだ is regularly
    paired with other expressions that show the 'source' of information, such as によると, orによれば.When ということだ
    is being used to express hearsay (statements that cannot easily be proven), it can be be rephrased
    as とのことだ. The literal difference between these two phrases is as follows:ということだ - It can be explained
    that (A) is ~ (more emphasis on the information)とのことだ - The statement of (A) has been applied to ~
    (more emphasis on the source that 'applied' the information)Cautionということだis considered to be more
    formal thanそうだwhen reporting information that has been heard from another source. This is primarily
    due toということだexpressing something that is thought to be a fact, whileそうだretains the nuance of being
    something that is a speculation/guess.
