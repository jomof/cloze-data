  writeup: だけましだis a set phrase indicating that 'at least (A)', or that 'one should feel grateful for
    (A)'. This expression is often used in cases where the overall situation is negative, but it is still
    better than the alternative. This structure is a combination of the particle だけ 'only', and the な-Adjective増し,
    meaning 'better', or 'preferable'. Originally, まし is just the conjunctive form of増す, an う-Verb meaning
    to grow or increase (like増える). Due to this, the literal meaning is 'even just (A) is a plus, compared
    to what could have occured'.だけましだwill be used primarily after verbs, い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives
    followed by な.In the vast majority of cases, まし will simply be written in hiragana, or even katakana
    as マシ. The katakana version often further emphasizes that one should be grateful for (A).Caution -
    Although not as common,だけまだましだmay also be seen. As can be seen by the addition of まだ 'still', this
    form merely emphasized the point even further.
