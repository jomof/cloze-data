  writeup: Being slightly more direct thanてくれる,てもらうremoves the meaning of 'to bestow' (to the speaker),
    and focuses on the meaning of 'to receive' (from the giver). Withてもらう,にwill mark the person that 'did
    something' for the subject, whileが(orは) will highlight the receiver themselves.In English, this grammar
    structure is regularly translated as 'to have (someone) do (A) for you', or 'to get (someone) to do
    (A) for you'. Literally, it means 'to receive the action of (A)'.てもらうis also regularly used when receiving
    a service from someone, asてくれるwould imply that the action was a favor.
