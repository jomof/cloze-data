  writeup: In itscitationusage, thecase marking particleとis often used with verbs in thepassiveform. Two
    of these regularly occurring verbs are考えられている'to be considered', and思われている'to be thought'.This grammar
    point is used after a phrase, and translates as 'it is considered that (A)', or 'it is thought that
    (A)'. It is generally used to highlight a commonly held opinion that most people agree on (not your
    personal opinion).The primary reason that these constructions are used in their displacement (passive)
    form, is to show that the thought itself is not something that is related to the speaker's own opinions.However,
    people will often use this form as a way to strengthen their own opinions, in a similar way to how
    English speakers would say 'everyone knows that (A)'.
  examples:
    - japanese: 「最初はグー」と最初に言ったのは、志村けんだと考えられている。
