  writeup: Likeて当然だ, the grammar point indicating that (A) is 'natural' or 'obvious',のは当然だworks in a similar
    way, and highlights that it is 'no wonder that (A)', or 'it is only natural that (A)'.This construction
    will be seen following verbs and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns that are followed by な.As
    can be seen in several of the above examples, も may replace は, with only a slight change in nuance
    (も will place extra emphasis on the obviousness of the remark, according to the speaker).Compared
    toて当然だ,のは当然だis slightly stronger, and separates the previous statement from what the speaker considers
    'natural'. This is equivalent to the difference between 'being happy is natural' (slightly weaker),
    and 'it's natural that one would be happy' (slightly stronger) in English.
