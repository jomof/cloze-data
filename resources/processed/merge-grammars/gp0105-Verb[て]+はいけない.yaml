  writeup: てはいけない is used in Japanese to express that (A) 'cannot', or 'must not' be done. It is the combination
    of a verb in て form, the は particle, and the negative potential form of 行く (to be able to go). In
    this way, it literally means '(A) cannot/is not able to go'.Although は can be dropped from many phrases
    and expressions, the は in this particular grammar point is usually not. This is because いけない would
    then become the second action in a sequence of events (the usual function of て form). However, to
    make this more casual, て は is often changed to ちゃ (ては becomes ちゃ), or じゃ (では becomes じゃ), as this
    is easier to say.CautionApart from いけない ; ならない and だめ are also frequently used to get across the same
    meaning. However, they are used in different situations.いけない - Fairly neutral. Used in both spoken
    and written language.ならない - Fairly formal. Used mostly in written language.だめ - Very casual. Used
    almost exclusively in spoken language.
