  details:
    Register: Standard
    使用域: 一般
  writeup: In a similar way to howところ(sometimes shortened to とこ) means 'about to (A)', or 'on the verge
    of (A)', when following the non-past form of a verb, when following theauxiliary verbた,ところwill mean
    'just did (A)'.To use this structure, make the past tense of any verb, and then addところ.While this
    expresses 'just did (A)',ていたmay be used when you would like to express that you were 'just doing (A)'.CautionWhen
    the kanji form of所is used, it is often referring to an actual physical location, rather than a situation/standpoint.
    However, this is something that native speakers will sometimes mistake. Therefore, seeing the kanji
    form and the hiragana form are both relatively common.
