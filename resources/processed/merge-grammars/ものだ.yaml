  writeup: もの (or物in its kanji form) is classified as a形式名詞(dummy noun) in Japanese. This just means a
    noun that is used in a similar way to 'thing' in English. もの regularly refers to things that do not
    have their own name, or are difficult to name due to their complexity. When もの is combined with theauxiliary
    verbだ, it implies that the previously mentioned (A) is something that 'is what it is'. This is often
    used in relation to customs, conventions, common sense, or to highlight results that would naturally
    be expected in any given situation.To use ものだ, attach it to the end of theattributive formof any word/word
    that ends a phrase that you would like to highlight as being an obvious piece of information.ものだas
    'supposed to', or 'the way it is' can also be used to negate a phrase, and say that it is 'something
    that isn't expected', or 'shouldn't be the case'. To do this,だwill be replaced with ではない, or じゃない.Cautionもの
    may sometimes be abbreviated as もん. This is far more common in spoken language, and can make the statement
    sound a bit more casual overall.
