    "writeup": "つもり だ (or です ) is a grammar point that can have several meanings in Japanese, but is often translated simply as 'intend to (A)', or 'plan to (A)'. It can be used after the plain (dictionary) form of verbs, or after the ない form.In the last two sentences, there is quite a large difference in nuance, and can be thought of as similar to the difference between 'to intend not to' ない つもり , and 'to have no intention of' つもり は ない in English. The former will mean that (A) is being actively avoided, while the latter will indicate that one simply has no plans to (A).Fun FactThe literal meaning of つもり comes from the verb 積 もる, which means 'to pile up', or 'to load'. Due to this, つもり is regularly used to describe people that are doing something that is out of character for them, meaning that they have 'piled up' whatever feeling was required to act that way.In this example, the nuance of つもり is 'so you're really going to act like you're apologizing?!' However, the literal meaning is closer to 'so you've really piled up enough (nerve) in order to act like that's an apology?!'CautionThe は in つもり は ない is interchangeable with が or じゃ (usually では is not used). The difference in nuance is that が gives the impression of being 'uninterested' in (A), while じゃ simply expresses that (A) is not the intended result.",
