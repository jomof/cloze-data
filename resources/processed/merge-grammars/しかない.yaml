  writeup: しかないis a commonly used expression in Japanese that is partnered with verbs. It is a combination
    of しか, theadverbial particle, and theい-Adjectiveない. This structure may be translated as 'to have no
    choice but (A)', or 'there is only (A)'.しかないregularly emphasizes the point that nothing apart from
    (A) is possible.To useしかない, simply attach it directly to the non-past form of whichever verb you would
    like to highlight as being the 'only' possible action.Unlike だけ, which implies that one particular
    option was chosen (out of several), しか always insinuates that (A) is the only option, and therefore
    will sound much stronger than だけ. Also, as only one option exists, it will often be assumed by the
    listener that some particular circumstances resulted in (A) being all that can be done.Fun FactOccasionally,しかないmay
    be used in manga, anime, or other forms of media that use casual language. In these cases, it is not
    uncommon to see しか abbreviated to っきゃ, resulting in っきゃない. However, this is not a common abbreviation
    in daily language.
