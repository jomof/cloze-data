  writeup: ものだからis a strong phrase that is used when explaining something or giving an excuse for one's
    reasoning. This grammar structure can simply be thought of as an extension of から 'because', with the
    noun もの 'thing' having its usual role of emphasizing what is said before it. Common translations include
    'because (A)', and 'the reason is (A)'.ものだからmay appear directly after verbs and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives
    and nouns that are followed with な.Occasionally,ものだからwill be abbreviated toもので, orもんで, without any
    change in the overall meaning. The change of だ to its conjunctive form で indicates that there is something
    coming after, despite the fact that what comes after may sometimes be omitted if it is obvious.Fun-fact
    - Although it is not a rule,ものだからwill primarily be used when explaining one's actions, as a way of
    emphasizing that the situation of (A) specifically led to the speaker doing (B).
