    "writeup": "が必要is a common expression in Japanese which is used to highlight the 'need' or 'necessity' of something. It is a structure that may only be used with nouns, which means that verbs will need to be nominalized (turned into noun-phrases) in order to use this construction.Bothがandだmay sometimes be omitted from this expression in casual speech. However, it is a good idea to at least useが,   to clarify the thing that is 'necessary'.",
