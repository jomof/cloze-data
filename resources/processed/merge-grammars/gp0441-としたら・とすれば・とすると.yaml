  writeup: When partnered with several of theassumptionbased expressions that are used in Japanese, thecase
    marking particleと may be used to show a hypothesis about a certain result. This is one of theresulthighlighting
    uses of と. Structures that may be seen are as follows:(A)としたら(B) - When (A) is the result, (B).(A)とすれば(B)
    - If the result is (A), (B).(A)とすると(B) - A result of (A) will be (B).Although these nuances are slightly
    different, realistically they are used in almost exactly the same way, to express a possible (undetermined)
    result. This can be translated to 'assuming that (A)', or 'if it were the case that (A)'.To use these
    expressions, simply attach と and your chosen variation of したら to the end of any verb/い-Adjective,
    or noun/な-Adjectivefollowed byだ.
