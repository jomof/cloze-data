  writeup: When used with thecase marking particleに, the う-Verb沿う 'to run alongside' in its て-form expresses
    that something is going 'along with (A)', 'in accordance with (A)', or 'in line with (A)'. This is
    primarily in relation to laws, conventions, traditions, needs, and other things which are not usually
    deviated away from. The nuance with this particular grammar structure is that (A) is the controlling
    factor, and (B) is being done with that in consideration.に沿ってmay also appear with the verb in its
    standard form when paired with a second noun, in order to modify that noun.As the base meaning of沿う
    is 'to follow along', it will also regularly be seen in relation to going along some specific path
    or street.While this grammar structure is relatively formal, when literally meaning 'alongside', it
    will be used fairly frequently.
