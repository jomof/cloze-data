  writeup: ころ, orごろ(the colloquial pronunciation) is a word which carries the meaning of 'around', or
    'about'. It is utilized in a similar way toくらい, but has a few differences. Whenごろis used, it will
    need to be attached to the end of a noun, or a noun followed byの.The main difference betweenころandくらいis
    thatころcan be (and often is) used to express a broad point in time, whileくらいis limited to expressing
    timeframes that are more specific.Conversely,ころwill not be used when expressing approximate distances/lengths.The
    primary reason for this is thatころexpresses a span of something, whileくらいexpresses an extent. In this
    way,ころcould also be translated as 'within the span of (A)', whileくらいis closer to 'at the point of
    (A)'. As an easier way to think about it, if we have a one meter ruler,ころcould express anywhere between
    1 to 100 centimeters (the span), butくらいcan only express somewhere between 90 and 100 centimeters (the
    extent).Just like with English, if the 'time' expressed is very specific, then eitherくらいorころcould
    be used naturally. This is due to the 'span', and the 'extent' already being something that is a 'precise
    point' in these cases.CautionThe kanji form of頃is also very common, so it is worth learning as soon
    as possible, to save any confusion while reading.
