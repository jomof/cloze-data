  writeup: In Japanese, almost any type of word can be attached to the beginning of a noun to modify the
    meaning, or describe the qualities of that noun. However, depending on the type of word used, conjugation
    rules will differ slightly.For い-Adjectives , they are simply attached to the front of the noun in
    their standard (dictionary) form.CautionWhen identifying what is an い-Adjective , and what is not,
    remember that an い-Adjective will always have the い outside of any kanji that are in the word. However,
    the reverse situation with な-Adjectives always having the い in the kanji is not true 100% of the time.面白
    い - The い is outside of the kanji, so 'interesting' is almost definitely an い-Adjective .綺麗 - The
    い is inside of the kanji, so 'clean' is definitely not an い-Adjective .One example of an exception
    as mentioned above is 嫌 い. Despite the い being outside of the kanji, 'hate' is actually a な-Adjective
    . Don't worry though, less than 1% of any adjective that has い on the outside of the kanji will actually
    be a な-Adjective !
  examples:
    - japanese: 新しい車(新しい)
      english: A new car.
    - japanese: 可愛い女の子がいる。
      english: There is a cute girl.
    - japanese: カッコいい先輩。
      english: Cool senpai
    - japanese: 寒い夜(寒い)
      english: Cold night.
    - japanese: 面白いゲームを買います。
      english: To buy an interesting game.
