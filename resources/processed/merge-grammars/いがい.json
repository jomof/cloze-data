    "writeup": "In order to mark something as 'except (A)', or 'besides (A)',以外will be used. This construction is a combination of the kanji以which means 'by means of', and外'outside'. This expression can most accurately be translated as 'with the exception of (A)', or 'everything outside of (A)'.To use以外, attach it to the thing that you want to highlight as being the 'all inclusive' amount/area.Fun Fact以外is also regularly used simply as an expression of surprise, when someone sees, hears, or reads something that is 'outside' of what they expected. However, in these cases, the more correct kanji construction is意外'out of mind'. This is a regular mistake that even native speakers make, so in many  cases, either意外or以外would be understandable.",
