  writeup: Almost always written purely in hiragana,まさかis a combination of まさ, anounmeaning 'precise',
    or 'exact', and theadverbial particleか. In modern Japanese,まさかis thought of as a singleadverbmeaning
    'it can't be true', 'no way', or 'don't tell me'.As it is treated primarily as an adverb,まさかwill most
    often appear at the beginning of a sentence, before some statement about what the speaker is shocked/surprised
    about.Fun Factまさ comes from正, meaning 'precise' or 'actual'. However, this noun is very rarely used
    in modern Japanese. まさに is an adverb used to mean 'precisely', whileまさかis another adverb used to mean
    'no way!'. However, the literal meaning ofまさかis closer to 'is it true?', or 'is it actually?', due
    to か's role in creating questions.
