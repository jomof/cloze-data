  writeup: In a very similar way toのは,ことis used in Japanese for nominalization (creating a noun-like phrase).
    However, unlikeのは, which is a combination of two particles,ことis anoun. To useこと, just add it to the
    end of a verb in its dictionary form.こと(or事in its kanji form) is a noun that is often translated as
    'thing', and in this way, literally means 'the thing that is (A)' when used for nominalization.As
    we can see from these examples, ない can also be used between the verb andこと, to form a 'not' statement.
    There are otherauxiliary verbsthat may be used withことin this way, but ない is the most common.Although
    this lesson discussesことpairing with the dictionary form of verbs, it can actually pair with any standard
    verb form. Standard form just means anything that does not finish with the polite ます.Fun FactUnlikeもの(another
    noun used to describe 'things'),ことis a noun that is frequently used to describe things that are 'intrinsic'.
    This basically means things that are describable, but not necessarily always observable (feelings,
    conditions, events, etc.).CautionWhen a sentence (usually short) finishes withこと, it quite often has
    the nuance of being a rule, or command. Thisことis not actually a noun, but asentence ending particle.ことas
    a particle will almost never be written in the kanji form. However, it does originate from the same
    word.

  writeup: '## The nominalizer こと turns not just a verb or adjective but an entire sentence into a noun
    phrase. For example, in Key Sentence the sentence 小説を書く ''one writes a novel'' becomes a complex noun
    phrase. Once a sentence has become a noun phrase, it can be used anywhere a regular noun phrase can
    be used. Thus, it can function as the subject, as in Key Sentence or Examples (a) and (e), or as the
    direct object, as in Examples (b) and (d), and so on.'
