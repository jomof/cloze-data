  writeup: を良いことにis an expression in Japanese that may be translated as 'to take advantage of (A)', and
    generally refers to someone that is using (A) as a good opportunity to do something that is either
    immoral, or irresponsible. This construction is a combination of を, the い-Adjective良い 'good', the
    noun こと 'thing', and the particle に. A more literal translation can be thought of as 'making good
    of (A), (B)', although the nuance is exactly the same as 'to take advantage of (A)' in English.を良いことにwill
    be seen following verbs, nouns, い-Adjectives and な-Adjectives, but will be preceded by either の or
    なの in all cases, based on standard conjugation rules for の.It is also quite common to see して attached
    to the end ofを良いことにwithout any significant change in either meaning or strength.
