  writeup: When combined with the particleに, and theう-Verbなる,ようexpresses that a particular action has
    reached the point of being completed/able to be completed. Because of this,ようになるis regularly translated
    as 'to reach the point that (A)', or 'to turn into (A)'.To useようになる, it will need to be added to the
    plain-potential, non-past form of a verb.CautionWhen using this grammar construction, we will need
    to remember thatするdoes not have apotentialform. Therefore,できるwill be used with words that usually
    act asするverbs.However,ようになるis not limited to being used in affirmative sentences, and may also be
    used after a verb with ない. This shows that something has reached the point of 'not' being able to
    be completed.

  writeup: '## 1. Although ようになる usually indicates a gradual change, when it is preceded by an affirmative
    verb the change may not take place gradually. Thus, an adverb such as 急に ''suddenly'' can co-occur
    with an affirmative verb and ようになる as seen in (1).'
