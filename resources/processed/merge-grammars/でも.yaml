  writeup: でも is one of many adverbial particles in Japanese. These are particles that behave like a regular
    助詞 (in that they appear after the words that they are referencing), but their role is a little bit
    more specific. でも itself has several uses, and the use that we will examine in this grammar point
    is called 例示 . Basically this means 'presenting examples'.In English, this results in a translation
    similar to 'even', or 'or something'. To use this structure, simply attach でも to the end of any noun
    , or pronoun .When grouped with a standard noun as above, でも is just showing that the noun is an example/suggestion,
    and that there are other choices/possibilities available. However, when the noun is a word like 誰
    , どこ , 何 , or いつ, the translation becomes much closer to English words like 'anyone', 'anywhere',
    'anything', or 'anytime'.Fun FactThere is debate among Japanese native speakers about whether でも should
    be considered its own word, or if it is actually just a combination of the particles で and も (or て
    and も in the case of verbs, but we will cover that later). As で and も together could be translated
    as 'even with (A)', it would also be correct to consider it this way.CautionWhen grouped with 何 ,
    the pronunciation will almost always change to なん. This is purely to make なんでも easier to say.
