    "writeup": "As mentioned in theわgrammar point, わ is anadverbial particlethat is commonly used in cases of stress of emphasis in Japanese. When used after either verbs, い-Adjectives, な-Adjectives, or nouns in theirstandard forms, it generally implies that (A) and (B) are negative factors that have lead to (C), where (C) is either a negative outcome, or a negative opinion. It will often be translated simply as 'with (A) and (B), (C)'.To use this structure, simply place わ after a word, and then repeat the same after a second (different) word. In the case of な-Adjective or nouns, だわ will be used. The case-marking particle で will then follow the second わ, indicating 'with', or 'as a consequence of'.わ〜わで, likeわ, primarily emphasizes the speaker's surprise in regard to the words that appear before it. However, unlikeわ, where the same verb will be repeated in order to highlight an excessive extent,わ〜わでsimply indicates surprise in terms of irritation or frustration. This structure is predominantly used by men, but it may also sometimes be used by women. However, there are several different variations of わ depending on where they appear in sentences, each of which have gender usage tendencies that will need to be learned.In essence,わis used in the same way as し〜し, where the words that they are being attached to are just being listed as reasons. Additionally, the で may occasionally be omitted.Fun Factわ is simply an emphatic version of the usual はadverbial particle, and originates from は being changed to わ. Due to this, the literal meaning can be thought of as a stronger version of the standard 'as for (A)' meaning of は.CautionWhile this grammar pattern is used almost exclusively with a negative nuance, it may, in rare cases, have a positive nuance.",
