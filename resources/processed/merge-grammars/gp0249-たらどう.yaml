  writeup: When theconjunction particleたらis used before theadverbどう, it primarily presents a situation,
    then asks a question about it potentially happening. This construction can be translated as 'why don't
    you (A)?', or 'what if you did (A)?'. Realistically, it just means 'when (A), how about that?'. It
    is often used for giving advice.To use this expression, convert the verb that you want to use into
    itsたらform, and then add どう.Sometimesたらis used by itself, with a tone that implies that it is a question
    (or simply by adding a question mark in written language). This is an abbreviation ofたらどう, and carries
    the same nuance.だorかmay be added to the end ofたらどう, to emphasize the 'question' even further. However,
    they are not required.CautionDespite being used for giving advice,たらどうmay be interpreted as criticism.
    Due to this, care will need to be taken with your tone of voice.
