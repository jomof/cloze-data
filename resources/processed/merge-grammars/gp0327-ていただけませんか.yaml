  writeup: ていただけませんかis thehumble speechform of てもらえませんか, which itself is the negativepotentialform ofてもらう'to
    have (A) done by someone else'.This structure is a combination ofて(the conjunction particle), theう-Verbいただく
    'to be topped with', the polite-negativeauxiliary verbません, and the question particle,か.Generally,
    it is translated in a similar way asてもらえませんか'won't you (A)', or 'could you please (A)'.This construction
    and いただく itself can regularly be seen as頂く, its kanji form. Due to this kanji literally meaning 'to
    be topped with', it is just acknowledging that the person that is doing the action for you (or someone
    in your group), is doing so from 'above' (sounds more respectful).Here we can see how the 'to be topped/capped
    with' meaning is used in a standard sentence.
