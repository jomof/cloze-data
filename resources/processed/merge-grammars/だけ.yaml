  writeup: だけ is used in Japanese in a similar way to 'only' or 'just' in English. The basic meaning of
    this word is that 'while there are/were several possibilities, only (A) is true/was chosen'. だけ is
    used by attaching it to the base (dictionary) form of any word, except for な-Adjectives , which require
    な when being used adjectivally.Due to な-Adjectives being able to be used as either a noun or an adjective,
    the meaning of a sentence will be different depending on whether だけ is used with the noun form, or
    the adjective form.Basically this difference just highlights whether something is being discussed
    in a measurable way (an adjective), or an immeasurable way (a noun).
  examples:
    - japanese: 一人だけです。
      english: Only one person.
    - japanese: それだけです。
      english: Only that.
    - japanese: サッカーだけが好き。
      english: I only like soccer.
    - japanese: 私だけ行きます。
      english: Only I am going.
    - japanese: その映画は長いだけ。
