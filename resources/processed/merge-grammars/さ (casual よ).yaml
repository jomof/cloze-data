  writeup: さis a感動詞(interjection) in Japanese that has three primary uses. These are as follows:誘い、促し
    - To invite, incite, or draw attention to something.驚き、当惑し - The express surprise, confusion, or bewilderment.話の流れを抑える
    - To control or keep in check the flow of a conversation.In this lesson, we will be focusing on a
    specific feature of the first meaning (to draw attention). Unlike other types of drawing attention
    thatさis able to be used for (see this grammar point), thisさwill only appear at the end of sentences.
    Here,さis almost identical in meaning to that of よ, with a slight added nuance of high confidence in
    what one is saying.CautionThisさis primarily used by men, and can vary in meaning depending on the
    speaker's tone of voice. However, in almost all situationsさwill mean 'what I just said is correct'
    (sometimes angrily, sometimes informatively, and even sometimes in a completely carefree way).Women
    may also useさas a sentence ender, but わよ tends to be more common.
  examples:
    - japanese: 彼氏がもう私のことを信用できないってさ。
      english: My boyfriend told me that he can't trust me anymore. (Added confidence gives the nuance
        of 'can you believe it!')
    - japanese: インスタで見たんだけど、キヨミの赤ちゃんが明日生まれるんだってさ！
      english: I saw it on instagram, but I heard that Kiyomi is going to give birth tomorrow.
    - japanese: そんなこと心配ないさ!俺に任せとけ！
      english: Such a thing is not necessary! Leave it to me! (Trust it to me in advance, so that it is
        not a problem later)
    - japanese: お前さ...
      english: You… (Are you freaking serious)
    - japanese: たかし君も行きたいってさ。どうしよう?彼も招待する?
      english: Takashi-kun said he wants to go too. What should we do? Should we invite him too?
    - japanese: そんなの俺にだってできるさ。分からないけど。
