    "writeup": "あげる is a verb with many uses in Japanese. It's original meaning is 'to raise', but is also used as a polite speech way of saying 'to give'. In this way it can be thought of as similar to 'to offer up' in English. As polite speech has the same basic subject and object rules as standard speech, the giver will be marked with は or が , while the recipient will be marked with に . As usual, the 'object' that is being given will be marked with を .From these three examples, we can see that the order of 'giver', 'recipient', and 'object' does not matter, so long as the correct particles are used.Cautionあげる should not be used when giving something to someone of a higher status, or when lowering oneself to elevate another. This is done through honorific language , or humble speech , and will use different verbs.Fun FactAlthough あげる is considered polite speech, it is the most natural way of saying 'to give'. やる is the 'casual' equivalent of あげる , but due to やる sounding a little bit rough, あげる became the standard.",

However, あげる cannot be used when the indirect object is the first person (i.e., I or we) or a person with whom the speaker empathizes (usually a member of the speaker's in-group).
