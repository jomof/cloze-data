  writeup: In the same way that聞こえるis used to describe things that are 'audible',見えるcan be used to describe
    things that are 'visible'.見えるitself is an intransitive verb, meaning that the object that is 'visible'
    will be marked withが.When using見える, (A) will always be followed byが. However, the 'way that something
    looks' will be marked adverbially. This means that anい-Adjectivewill be changed to its く form, andな-Adjectives/nouns
    will be followed byに.This usage of見えるwill be covered more in our focused lesson on this particular
    grammar structure.Fun FactThe primary difference between見える, and見られる(thepotentialform of見る), is that見えるis
    used to identify things that do not require the active concentration of the spectator to be seen.
    In other words, seeing it is unavoidable (if looking in its direction of course). However,見られるis used
    when the onlooker, is trying to concentrate on some specific object, and is referring to their 'ability'
    to see it.Fun Fact見えるis also sometimes used to describe the 'sense' of sight, and refers to whether
    anything is visible at all for the speaker.
