    "writeup": "The て form of a verb, followed by another verb phrase is often translated to 'then', or 'and then', and is how Japanese lists sequences of events that happen one after another.CautionThis grammar construction is used for listing things that happen in order, for example 'I did (A), then (B), then (C)'. Other grammar structures will need to be used if you would like to talk about things that happen/happened in no particular order. For example たり〜たりする , which will appear in a sentence like 'I did things like (C), and (A), oh, and (B)!'",
