  writeup: をもってis a formal grammar pattern stemming from the meaning of its kanji counterpart以て 'by means
    of'. It is used in a similar way to the case-marking particle で, and will be translated as 'with (A)',
    'by (A)', 'via (A)', or 'by means of (A)'.As this structure is preceded by the particle を, it will
    only be used directly following nouns, or noun phrases.Despite being similar to で in meaning,をもってwill
    generally not be used in regard to simple methods of doing something, such as 'traveling by train'.
    Due to this, the translation of 'by means of' is the most accurate, as it would only be used in situations
    where the speaker is trying to emphasize the means, like in English. In addition to this, it is not
    often used with concrete items, such as a fork or a hammer, but instead will appear alongside abstract
    concepts, like 'with sincerity', or 'with compassion'.Fun Factをもってすればis a commonly occuring pattern,
    and may be translated as 'going off the assumption that it were with (A)'.
