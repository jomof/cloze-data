  writeup: As anadverbial particle,きりmay convey that 'upon (A)', where (A) is usually a verb, that action
    was the 'first and last time'. This is frequently translated as 'only', 'just', or 'since'.きりcomes
    from the う - Verb切る'to cut'.きりis often used after the plain past form of verbs, with nouns, or with
    counters. Let's look at verbs first.With verbs,きりis primarily used to show that (A) occurring was
    all that was required for (B). Usually, this results in some permanent consequence, or permanent change
    of opinion. In almost every situation, (A) is something that has only happened once, andきりcan be interpreted
    as 'ever since'.When it comes to the use ofきりwith nouns or counters, it will express that something
    is happening with (A) as the limit 'nothing more, nothing less'. In other words, (A) is all that will
    be included in some particular situation/action.Cautionきりmay also be seen asっきりorキリ. There is no specific
    change in nuance, butっきりis the most common casual form.
