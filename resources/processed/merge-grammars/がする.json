    "writeup": "In Japanese, describing things that can be experienced with the senses (excluding visual), is a little bit different to the way that we would convey it in English. Traditionally, we would use unique verbs for each of these situations, such as 'smells like (A)', 'tastes like (A)', 'feels like (A)', etc. While this is still possible in Japanese, it is not the most common way.がするis a grammar construction that focuses on the source of the smell, sound, taste, or feeling, and makes the sensory experience itself the subject of the sentence. To useがする, simply attach it to the end of any phrase that expresses which type of 'sense' is being created/given off by the subject.Fun FactJapanese often uses気'energy', 'spirit', as something that can be perceived with the senses. Due to this, there are many phrases which use〜気がするin the same way as this grammar point.",
