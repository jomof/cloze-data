  writeup: いきなり, a word appearing almost exclusively in hiragana, is an adverb that conveys the meaning
    of 'suddenly', 'all of a sudden', or 'for no reason'.いきなりindicates when something happens abruptly,
    and without any prior warning.Asいきなりis an adverb, it will primarily appear at the beginning of sentences,
    or directly before the verb that it is describing.Fun-fact -いきなりcomes from行き成り, but is rarely seen
    in its kanji form. This original meaning referred to a particular situation's development or unfolding.
    Due to this, although often being used purely as 'suddenly', it has a similar nuance to English phrases
    like 'a sudden turn of events'. This just expresses that the way the situation developed was abrupt
    or unexpected.
