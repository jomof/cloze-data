  writeup: In order to create the past form of い-Adjectives , you must add the auxiliary verb た to the
    'past' conjunction form of the い-Adjective . The past conjunction form is created by removing the
    い and replacing it with かっ. This structure is equivalent to 'was' in English.面白 い - 'Interesting'
    in its base (dictionary form).面白 かっ - The conjugation form used with た (and several other auxiliary
    verbs ).From these examples, we can see how the casual past form is constructed. In modern Japanese,
    simply adding です after た is considered to be the standard polite past form.CautionAlthough this is
    considered to be polite by most people, using です after かった is not academically correct Japanese. However,
    considering how common its usage has become, it may be used in almost any situation confidently.
  examples:
    - japanese: 寒かった。
      english: It was cold.
    - japanese: それは、高かった。
      english: That was expensive.
    - japanese: 田中さんは強かったです。
      english: Tanaka-san was strong.
    - japanese: 私の姉の家が古かったです。
      english: My (older) sister's house was old.
    - japanese: 動物園は楽しかった。
      english: The zoo was fun.
