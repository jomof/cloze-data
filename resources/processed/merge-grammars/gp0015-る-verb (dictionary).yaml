  writeup: る-Verbs are verbs that have only one possible conjugation pattern. This pattern simply involves
    the replacement of る with another construction, depending on the tense of the verb ( past , negative
    , etc). This conjugation pattern that only includes る is where the Japanese name Ichidan ( 一段 ) 'one-level'
    comes from.In these examples, we can see that る is removed from the verb to create the polite ます form.
    The る form of the verb is often called 'plain form', 'casual form', or 'short form', depending on
    the source/book. All る-Verbs end in the kana る, there are no exceptions to this rule.CautionWhile
    all る-Verbs end in る, not all verbs that end in る are る-Verbs . These verbs can be identified by the
    る changing, rather than being removed when conjugated.As the る in 取 る becomes り in 取 ります, we can determine
    immediately that it is not a る-Verb , but actually a う-Verb .
  examples:
    - japanese: それも取る。
      english: I will take that too.
    - japanese: それも取ります。
      english: I will take that too.
