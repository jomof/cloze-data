    "writeup": "One of the common uses of the particle か is often translated to 'or' in English. While this translation is accurate, it is not actually any different from か 's regular usage as a question marker.From these examples, we can see that, in Japanese, か is performing the same role that a question mark would, or that a change in tone of voice would in spoken language.'Would you like tea? coffee?' (said with a rising tone).This nuance of か can be used after the dictionary form of almost any word in Japanese. However, using です or ます will change the nuance from 'presenting possibilities', to 'asking a formal question', so should be avoided.",
