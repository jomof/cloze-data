  writeup: To convey that '(A) was happening', or that somebody 'was doing (A)' in Japanese,ていた(or ていました)
    will be used.ていたis a construction which uses the conjunction particleて, and the ichidan verbいる(to
    exist), in its past tense form いた.Sometimesていたis used to express things that are still ongoing, but
    the speaker is not sure about, or would like to politely advise the listener about. This is very similar
    to the way in which English uses '(A) was doing (B)'.In this example, although the action of 'sitting'
    is not finished, we can imagine that the speaker is suggesting that 'dad was sitting here, and he
    still is, but he just went to get a drink'.The same kind of sentence could be used when the speaker
    has walked away from where their dad was sitting, and doesn't actually know if he is still sitting
    there or not.
