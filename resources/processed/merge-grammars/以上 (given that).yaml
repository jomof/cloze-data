  writeup: When combined with theadverbial particleは,以上is frequently translated as 'since (A), (B)', 'now
    that (A), (B)', or 'as long as (A), (B)'. This is a formal structure that is rarely found in daily
    speech.This construction may be used with verbs and い-Adjectives in their standard forms, and な-Adjectives
    or nouns followed byである以上は.As with many other grammar points, the particle is often dropped, leaving以上by
    itself.Due toである以上はoften presenting something which is being acted upon, the (B) part of sentences
    that include this grammar structure will frequently include the resolutions or intentions of the speaker,
    and can be thought of as either obvious or necessary once considering (A). This usually appears in
    the form of べきだ, つもりだ, はずだ, たい, ほうがいい, and similar patterns.Fun-fact - Despite the standard translations,
    the literal meaning of 'above and beyond (A), (B)' is also a good way to remember this grammar pattern,
    as it basically highlights that anything 'past', 'beyond', or 'above' (A) is what needs to be considered.
