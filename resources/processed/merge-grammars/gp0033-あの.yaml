  writeup: あの is classified as a ' pre-noun adjectival ' in Japanese. These are a special type of word
    that do not conjugate. This means that they will always appear in the same form. あの comes from the
    same family of words as あれ and あそこ , and is used to identify a 'thing' that is away from both the
    listener, and the speaker. It is usually translated as 'that' (thing over there).As the name ' pre-noun
    adjectival ' suggests, these words will always appear before a noun, and describe that noun in some
    way.

    - japanese: あの人はトムです。
      english: That person over there is Tom.
