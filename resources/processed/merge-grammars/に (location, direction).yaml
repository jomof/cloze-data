  writeup: に can be a very difficult particle to master in Japanese, as it has many different translations
    in English. These translations are usually 'in', 'at', 'to', 'for', or 'on'. Let's look at an example
    of each meaning.While these examples may seem quite confusing at first, it will be easier to think
    of に as always having one 'basic' meaning. That meaning is to be the 'end-point' of an action. This
    means that whatever action is being described, can only be considered complete/able to be completed
    once you're at/while you're at the location/time described in the sentence.Verbs like 住 む (to live/dwell)
    often confuse learners, as they use に instead of で . This is also due to the fact that 住 む is a verb
    that can only be 'completed' at the destination. (You can only complete the act of living/dwelling
    in the place that you live, so to speak).
  examples:
    - japanese: 彼はあそこにいます。
      english: He is at that place over there.
    - japanese: ここに本を置く。
      english: To place a book on this place (here).
    - japanese: この机の上に座る。
      english: To sit on this desk.
    - japanese: 駅に行く。
      english: To go to the station.
    - japanese: 病院に行く。
      english: To go to the hospital.
