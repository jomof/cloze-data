  writeup: なんかis an expression in Japanese that is frequently associated with theadverbial particleなど.
    They are thought to have overlapping meanings in many circumstances, andなんかitself may be considered
    anadverbial particle.なんてis an extension of this, and may be considered an abbreviation of などという 'to
    say something like'.Both なんか and なんて are used in the same way asなど, having translations like 'such
    as', and 'things like' in English. The primary difference between なんか and なんて is that なんて is far more
    common after用言(conjugatable words). This includes verbs,い-Adjectives, andな-Adjectives. On the other
    hand,なんかis almost exclusively used after体言(unconjugatable words). In other words, nouns.Despite the体言and用言tendency,
    most native speakers will not consider it incorrect to use eitherなんかorなんてwith any type of word.Fun
    FactBothなんかandなんてare often used to show a low evaluation of the word that they follow. This can come
    across as humility when used in relation to oneself, or as an insult when used in relation to others.Don't
    let this point stop you from usingなんかorなんてthough, as many native speakers use it simply to fill the
    silence in modern Japanese.
