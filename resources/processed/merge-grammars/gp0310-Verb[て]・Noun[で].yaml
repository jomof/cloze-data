  writeup: Theconjunction particleて, or thecase marking particleでare often used to highlight when something
    is being 'used'. The thing being used does not necessarily need to indicate a tool, but can also indicate
    a circumstance/situation. In these cases, '(A)で(B)' translates as 'with/by means of (A), (B)'.Fun
    FactWithて(andで), the nuance is quite often that '(A) allowed/led to (B)'. This may be a simple sequence
    of events, or may be through the direct use of a tool/situation. The nuance that is being highlighted
    will always depend on the (B) phrase. Due to this, it is important to always read the (B) clause,
    before deciding what the speaker is trying to convey.
