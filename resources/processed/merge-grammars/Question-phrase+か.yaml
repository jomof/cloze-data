  writeup: 'Often, theadverbial particleかis used in the middle of a sentence, in the same way that it
    is as asentence ending particle. The main differences are as follows:Adverbial Particle: 副助詞- Highlights
    uncertain things ''不確かであること''. This is the same か as inどこか''somewhere''.Sentence Ending Particle:
    終助詞- Highlights doubts and questions ''疑問や質問''. This is a direct question.In the case of theadverbial
    particleかand ''uncertain things'', this will almost always be followed by a word that is seeking information
    about the uncertain thing.As can be seen in these examples, sometimes theadverbial particlewill appear
    by itself, and sometimes it will appear together with thesentence ending particlein the same sentence.
    However, due to the ''uncertainty'' being displayed by the adverbial particle, the question marker
    at the end of the sentence is not required.CautionThisかshould not be preceded byだ(orです), this is why
    words likeどこかand誰かare notどこだか and誰だか.'
