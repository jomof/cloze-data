  writeup: As mentioned in our first ている lesson, this construction is used to convey that someone or something
    is existing in a constant state of 'doing' the verb that comes before て . Here we will take a closer
    look at several of the verbs that will be used with ている , to express 'existing in a state of (A) having
    been done'.All of these verbs would appear as the past form in English, after the initial thing has
    'started', 'come', 'died', or 'gotten angry'. However, this is not the case in Japanese. In Japanese,
    once something is angry, it exists in the state of being angry, once something has started, it exists
    in the state of being ongoing, once something dies, it exists in the state of being dead, and so on.Fun
    FactOne of the easiest ways that you can tell whether a verb will use the ている form, or the past form,
    is to think about whether it can happen twice. Something cannot 'start' twice, so it will use ている
    . Something cannot die twice, so it will use ている , etc. This does not work with every verb, but will
    help with over 90% of the verbs that require this form.Something has fallen and is already on the
    ground, so it cannot fall again. ている will be used.
  examples:
    - japanese: ピアノが落ちている。
      english: The piano has fallen. (Existing in the state of having fallen)
    - japanese: バスは今大阪に来ています。
      english: The bus is in Osaka now. (The bus has come to Osaka and is there now)
    - japanese: パーティーは始じまっている。
      english: The party has begun. (The party has begun and is still going on)
    - japanese: 電車は東京に行っています。
      english: The train is in Tokyo. (The train has gone to Tokyo and is there)
    - japanese: ななさんのバナナは腐っています。
      english: Nana's banana is rotten. (Nana's banana is in a state of being rotten)
    - japanese: 喫茶店はもう閉まっています。
      english: The coffee shop is already closed. (The coffee shop has been closed and remains closed)
