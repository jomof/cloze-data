    "writeup": "〜のが好き is a common construction that is used in Japanese to express that you like/love doing something. This particular expression is used with the plain ( dictionary ) form of verbs only.In these examples, we can see that there is no difference between Ichidan verbs and Godan verbs . Both will be used in their plain forms. In this expression, のが is performing the same function as in the regular のは or のが construction. This function is nominalization (turning a phrase into a noun). However, のは may not be used with this phrase, as が will always appear with adjectives.CautionIf you want to express that you liked doing something (in the past), the verb will still remain in the plain form, but 好き will change to past tense.This construction can also be used to ask questions about what other people like. This is done through the addition of か .",
