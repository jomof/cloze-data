  writeup: Like だけに,だけあってis a phrase that is used to show that something is 'only natural for (A)', or
    'as might be expected of (A)'. This structure includes the particle だけ 'just', or 'only', and the
    て-form of the う-Verb ある 'to be'. In this way, the more literal meaning may be interpreted as 'just
    being (A), (B)', and implies that the innate trait or traits of (A) led to the expected result of
    (B).だけあってwill only be used when the expected result is something that is positive in relation to (A).Like
    most other grammar patterns that begin with だけ, this structure may be used with verbs, い-Adjectives,
    な-Adjectives followed by な, or nouns.Caution - Asだけあってemphasizes an innate or constant quality of
    (A), it will not be used for things that are not obvious, or have not yet happened. This means thatだけあってwill
    not appear in sentences discussing things that may happen in the future, and will also not often be
    utilized with phrases such as だろう, でしょう, かもしれない, or similar structures that express uncertainty.
