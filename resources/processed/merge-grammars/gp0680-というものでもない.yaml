  writeup: というものではないis an expression in Japanese that indicates that 'there is no guarantee that (A)',
    or that it is 'not necessarily (A)'. As this structure is just a combination of と, the う-Verb言う 'to
    say', もの 'thing', and ではない 'isn't', the literal meaning can be thought of as being similar to 'it's
    not a thing that one can say is (A)'.は may be replaced with も, with only a slight change in nuance.
    As with many grammar patterns, the version with も will be considered a bit more emphasized.というものではないmay
    follow any word in its standard form, but may occasionally be preceded by だ when used with nouns or
    な-Adjectives (despite not being required).In most cases, this grammar pattern will indicate that while
    most of the time (A) might be something that is expected to be true, there are exceptions.Fun-fact
    - Although not specifically limited to it,というものではないsentences are often preceded by phrase including
    であれば. These sentences merely emphasize the fact that 'even if it's (A), it doesn't necessarily mean
    that (B)'.
