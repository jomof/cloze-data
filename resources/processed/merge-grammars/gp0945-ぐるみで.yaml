  writeup: When following nouns, thesuffixぐるみ 'including (A)', 'all over (A)', or '(A) wide' is used to
    express that something encompasses absolutely all of (A). ぐるみ stem from the う-Verb包む, meaning 'to
    wrap', or 'to encompass'. In many cases, thecase marking particleで will follow ぐるみ to mark 'with',
    but の may also be seen when preceding a second noun.ぐるみ is most frequently seen following words that
    specify a whole 'group' or 'span' to which the topic of the sentence is only one part of. This could
    be one member of a family, one home within a neighborhood, one student within a school, or any other
    number of things that share a clearly identifiable link.Despite this, the primary nuance will always
    be that the group itself shares a common trait, rather than focusing on any individual part.
