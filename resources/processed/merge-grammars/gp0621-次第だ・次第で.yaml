  writeup: Coming after another noun,次第'directly following' is a noun that will often be used in a similar
    way to asuffix. In these cases, it will be followed by だ, or で and a part (B) statement. In this use,次第will
    be translated as 'depending on (A), (B)', or '(B) depends on (A)'. (A) will most frequently highlight
    a person or some specific situation that is considered to be in control of what happens next.Fun-fact
    - In all of its nuances,次第just expresses a sequence of events or deciding factors, and what either
    will or has happened due to that. This link can be seen in other grammar patterns like次第'as soon as'
    , and次第です'due to that', or 'as a result of that'.
