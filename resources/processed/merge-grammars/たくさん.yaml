  writeup: There are many cases in Japanese where a noun will appear as an adverb, particularly with words
    that are describing amounts. たくさん , or 沢山 as it is regularly seen, is one of those words. たくさん means
    'a lot', or 'many' in Japanese, and can be used before a phrase, or directly before a noun, when separated
    via の .Cautionたくさん may be used before a noun without also using の . However, in this case, it will
    feel more like たくさん is describing the whole phrase, rather than just the noun it is in front of. If
    you strongly want to highlight the noun, using の would be best.In these examples, the only difference
    is that the sentence with の feels like the speaker is putting extra focus on the people, rather than
    the gathering that is happening.
  examples:
    - japanese: あの店の前に沢山人が集まっている。
      english: There are a lot of people gathering in front of that store. (Focuses on the store. I wonder
        why there are so many people in front of that store)
    - japanese: あの店の前に沢山の人が集まっている。
      english: There are a lot of people gathering in front of that store. (Focuses on the people. The
        amount of people gathering up in front of that store is unbelievable)
    - japanese: たくさんありますから。食べてください。
      english: There is plenty. So, please eat.
    - japanese: たくさん雪が降りました。
      english: A lot of snow fell.
    - japanese: 日本語の勉強をたくさんしました。
