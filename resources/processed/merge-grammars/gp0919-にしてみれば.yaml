  writeup: にしてみれば, usually written completely in hiragana, is an expression used when the speaker is making
    a hypothetical statement about how something may appear from the point of view of another. It will
    often be translated as 'from the point of view of (A), (B)', 'in the case of (A), (B)', or simply
    'for (A), (B)'. Literally, the meaning is 'assuming that I was (A) and then looking from there, (B)'.にしてみればwill
    appear after nouns that represent a person, or organizations representative of people. It is a combination
    of the case-marking particle に, the て-form of する, and thehypothetical formof見る,見れば.Asにしてみればwill exclusively
    follow words that indicate a person or a group of people, the (B) part of the phrase will usually
    discuss how the speaker assumes that they would feel given the situation. Because of this assumption,
    these sentences often finish with だろう, でしょう, かもしれない, and other similar structures.
