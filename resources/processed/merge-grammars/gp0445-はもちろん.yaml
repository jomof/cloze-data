  writeup: はもちろん, or occasionally は勿論, is a phrase in Japanese that presents (A) as being something obvious,
    while (B) should still be considered/mentioned. In this expression, theadverbial particleは presents
    (A) as being a stand-alone topic, before theadverbもちろん 'naturally' emphasizes that (A) is what it
    is. After this, the (B) part of the sentence will describe some other factor that is worth mentioning.はもちろんwill
    be used directly after noun (A), before the sentence will go on to discuss noun (B). This construction
    can be translated as 'not only (A), but (B)', 'not to mention (A), (B)', and other similar English
    expressions.In many cases, despite (A) being the obvious factor, (B) is being highlighted as sharing
    similar qualities to (A). This means that inはもちろんsentences, も will almost always be seen after (B).CautionWhile
    quite similar in meaning toだけでなく,はもちろんis quite a bit more formal. Due to this, it may sound quite
    stiff in friendly conversation, unless particularly emphasizing something.
