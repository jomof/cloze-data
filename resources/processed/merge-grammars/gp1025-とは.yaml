  writeup: とはis an emphatic structure that is regularly seen at the end of sentences, and will imply that
    the statement before it is shocking, appalling, or unexpected. In English, it translates very similarly
    as 'to think that (A)' in that it expresses a strong emotional response without expressly saying what
    that exact response is.とはis a combination of the case-marking particle と in itsquotationuse, and theadverbial
    particleは. In this way, it is just marking the whole statement of (A) as what is being highlighted
    as the topic, without actually stating anything else about it.とはmay sometimes be seen following など
    or similar structures, and in these cases will just imply that 'something like (A)' is what is shocking.CautionAlthough
    it is common forとはto come at the end of a sentence with the actual feeling word omitted, the speaker
    may expressly state their reaction afterwards.
