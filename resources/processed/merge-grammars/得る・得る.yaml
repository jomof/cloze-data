  writeup: 得るis a る-Verb that has the meaning of 'to gain', or 'to acquire'. When attached to theconjunctive
    formof verbs, it takes on the nuance of 'for (A) to be possible', or 'to be able to (A)'.Compared
    to できる, meaning that the potential to do something exists.得るmeans something closer to 'there is a
    possibility that (A) can be done', or 'the possibility to do (A) has been gained'.Caution -得るmay be
    seen as either える or うる. The primary difference between the two being that うる is a relatively old
    form that is often seen in literature, and spoken far less frequently than える. Despite this, there
    is a tendency for うる to be the preferred spoken choice when the kana that appears before it is え,
    such as教える becoming教えうる, rather than教ええる.Fun-fact -得るis far more formal/bookish than できる. However,
    there are several set phrases that are very common in daily speech that use this particular grammar
    point, such as あり得る'possible', and あり得ない'impossible'.
