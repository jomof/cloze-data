  writeup: にくわえてis a formal grammar pattern in Japanese that is a combination of に, and the て-form of
    the る-Verb加える 'to add', or 'to append'. Often, this structure will be translated as 'in addition to
    (A), (B)', or 'not only (A), but also (B).Being that it is a formal phrase,に加えてwill also often appear
    in its formal-conjunctive formに加え.To useにくわえて, simply place it directly after the noun that you would
    like to highlight as being the base information, before discussing what exactly is 'in addition' to
    that base in the following clause.Both the kanji and hiragana forms of this structure are fairly common,
    so it will be beneficial to remember both.Caution -にくわえてis frequently used when (B) is something that
    is in addition to (A) in respect to magnifying what was already true of (A). This just means that
    it will often be used to highlight something being brought about by (B) that would not be possible
    with just (A) by itself. This increase may be either positive or negative.
