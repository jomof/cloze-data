  writeup: As anoun, あまり means 'excess', and refers to an amount of something that is in surplus. This
    noun is quite often used after many different types of words, to indicate that something happened/exists
    to an excessive degree (which then resulted in something negative occurring). By itself,余り is not
    negative. However, this grammar point can be thought of as a set phrase that is generally used in
    negative situations.To use あまり, you will need to attach it to the end of the following structures.
    A verb, anい-Adjective(that has been turned into a noun through the use of さ or み) followed by の, aな-Adjectivefollowed
    by な, or a noun followed by の. Then, after あまり, a (B) phrase will highlight what the negative result
    was.CautionThe tense of the overall sentence will be dependent on the first clause. Therefore, it
    is common to see the verb beforeあまりbeing used in several different tenses.
