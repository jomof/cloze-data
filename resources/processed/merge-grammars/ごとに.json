    "writeup": "ごとにis an combination of the nounごと, and the particleに. Together, they are used adverbially to express that something happens 'every (A)', or 'at intervals of (A)'.ごとにmay be used after any verb (usually in non-past form), or noun.Althoughごとにmay be used after verbs, the most common use is with nouns, or phrases that finish with nouns.Cautionごと is the訓読み (Japanese reading) of the kanji毎, which means 'every'. This fact will be important when trying to remember the difference betweenごとにandおきに, a similar grammar point which can also mean 'every', but focuses more on 'interval' or 'gap' of a specific time or distance. Due toおきにfocusing on the space between 'each (A)', there are sentences whereおきにandごとにwill have different meanings.Here, we can see thatごとにwill mean 'every week', whileおきにwill mean 'every second week', due to there being a 'one week interval' whenおきにis used. To make things easier, these two expressions can be remembered in the following way.(A)ごとに= During every (A), (B).(A)おきに= After every space of (A), (B).Fun FactMany native speakers make mistakes with the difference betweenおきにandごとに, so there are quite a large number of people (especially in the younger generation) that will consider them completely interchangeable.",
