    "writeup": "たってis a casual structure that carries the same meaning as 'ても' or 'でも', and can be used with a wide variety of words. Common translations include 'even if (A)', 'even though (A)', or 'no matter how (A)'.In the case of verbs,たってconjugates in the standard way that the た past-tense form usually would.For い-Adjectives,たってattaches to the conjugative く-form.For nouns and な-Adjectives, た will change to だ, and だって will then be used with the stem noun or adjective.Fun-fact - Althoughたってis widely considered a casual form of ても, it originally stems from たとて, which is a combination of theauxiliary verbた, and the particle とて, which itself is thought to be an old-fashioned abbreviation of と言っても. In this way, the modern abbreviation ofたってstill reflects the original extended nuance of たと言っても 'even if (A) is said, (B)'.",
