  writeup: べくしてis a combination of theconjunctive formof theclassical auxiliary verbべし, べく, and the conjunctive
    particle して, which shows a situation from which a logical determination can be made, or will be a
    natural course of action. べく itself indicates the word that it is attached to as a 'purpose' or 'end
    goal'.べくしてis often translated simply as 'as expected of (A), (B)', or 'as was supposed to (A), (B)'.
    (A) and (B) will be the same verb repeated.The literal meaning of 'as determined with the purpose
    of (A)' may also be used if it helps to remember the nuance. This expression is quite formal, so will
    rarely be heard in daily speech.Fun FactAs mentioned in other grammar patterns that contain variations
    of べく such as べき and べし, this structure derives from the kanji可, which is usually translated as 'permissible'
    or 'allowed'. All 可 really indicates is a situation that does not currently exist, but it certain
    to come about as a part of the most logical course of events.
