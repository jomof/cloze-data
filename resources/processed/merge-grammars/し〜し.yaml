  writeup: Likeて,しis aconjunction particle. This means that it is used for linking the (A) and (B) parts
    of a sentence, and describing that link in some way. The 'description' thatしwill highlight is 'reasons'.
    Regularly it is translated simply as 'and'.しmay be connected to the end of almost any word, but will
    require aだbefore it when it comes after nouns orな-Adjectives.しwill follow every 'reason' that is being
    listed in a sentence. However, the lastしmay be replaced withからorので, before the 'result' is stated.Usingしwill
    indicate that each 'reason' being listed is of equal weight/importance. Because of this, it would
    not be appropriate to use in sentences where one of the reasons clearly far outweighs everything else.Fun
    FactIn all of its uses,しindicates things that are矛盾無く共存する, which basically means 'things that coexist,
    without contradicting each other'. This is the primary reason why each thing listed must be of equal
    importance (in terms of the overall story that the speaker is trying to convey).
