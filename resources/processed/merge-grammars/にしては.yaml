  writeup: Likeとして, にして highlights an aspect of something from which another thing happens. The primary
    difference being that と implies that (B) results from (A), whileにimplies that (B) happens/exists at
    the same time as (A). This reflects thecase marking particleに's use as a location. Theadverbial particleは
    presents the entire (A) phrase as something that will be compared.にしてはis regularly translated as 'considering
    (A), (B)', or 'even for (A), (B)', and may be used with both verbs and nouns. Likeとして, にして is often
    considered as a stand-aloneadverbial particle, despite stemming from several parts.Despite the 'considering
    (A), (B)' translation,にしてはis closer in meaning to 'while (A), (B)'. This expresses that (A) and (B)
    share a simultaneous relation, but also that (B) is not necessarily a result of (A) at all.
