  writeup: Theconjunctionそれにis regularly considered to be one word in Japanese, but is more correctly
    just a combination of thepronounそれ, and thecase marking particleに.The thing thatそれis 'substituting'
    for is the entire clause/sentence that came before it, whileにhighlights that extra information is
    about to be added. In this way, it translates to 'and to that', or 'and on that', where 'that' is
    the previous information. Often, it is translated simply as 'moreover', 'in addition', or 'and'.Becauseそれにis
    'adding' information withに, the (B) information itself must be something that would logically happen
    'in addition to (A)', or 'as a result of (A)'. Therefore,それにwill highlight something that has either
    all positive, or all negative connotations. Never both.
