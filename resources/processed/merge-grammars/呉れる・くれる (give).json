    "writeup": "## 1. くれる, which is one of a set of giving and receiving verbs, means 'give'. Unlike the English 'give', however, くれる is used only when the receiver is the first person or someone with whom the speaker empathizes (usually a member of the speakers in-group). Thus, (1) is unacceptable. (If the speaker empathizes with Mr. Ito, (1) is considered acceptable. Addressing someone as \"Mr. Ito\", however, is too formal in such a situation.)\n\n- (I) give (someone)\n- (someone) gives (me)\n- (I) get/receive (from someone)\n- －politeness＋\n- Plain form\n- ①やるto someone of lower status②あげる\n- ②くれる\n- ①もらう\n- Polite form\n- ②差し上げるvery humble\n- ①くださるhonorificますform:くださいます\n- ①いただく",
