  writeup: ともあろうis a grammatical structure in Japanese which highlights either the skill or responsibility
    that a particular person or organization has, and what they are doing despite that, or that contradicts
    that. It will be interpreted as ‘(A) of all people’, or ‘such as (A)’. Often,ともあろうwill be followed
    by the speaker's opinion about how (A) is being ignorant of what is expected of them.This construction
    is a combination of thecase-marking particleと, theadverbial particleも, and the volitional form of
    the う-Verb ある, あろう ‘to be’. The literal meaning is ‘even a (B) such as (A), (C)’, with (C) being something
    unexpected or unwanted.ともあろうwill be seen after nouns, and may be followed by theconjunction particleが
    ‘but’, or a combination of the noun もの and が for further emphasis.もの is primarily used for emphasis,
    and other words such as方‘individual’, or人‘person’ may also be used.CautionOccasionally, this grammar
    pattern may be used sarcastically towards someone of the same position or lower. The context of the
    sentence is the only thing  that would clarify whether it is criticism or sarcasm.
