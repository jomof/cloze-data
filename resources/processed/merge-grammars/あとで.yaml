  writeup: In Japanese,あとでis a combination of the noun後(behind), and the particleで(with). When these words
    are linked, they form an adverbial phrase which is used to express 'after', or 'later'. As withで's
    standard meaning of 'with',あとでis simply highlighting that something will happen, 'with' the 'after/behind'
    part of something.To useあとで, attach it to the end of any past-tense verb, noun followed byの, or verb
    followed byのは(nominalization).Fun FactThe reason that後is translated as both 'after', and 'behind',
    is because sequences of events in Japanese behave similarly to a train. When the head of the train
    (one action) passes a specific point, there are still potentially many carriages (other actions) coming
    'after', or 'behind' it.後でmay also be used to alter the meaning of an entire phrase, by appearing
    at the front. This nuance is just that (A) will happen (at some point) after now.
