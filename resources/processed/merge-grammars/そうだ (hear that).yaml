  writeup: Theauxiliary verbそうだ has two primary functions in Japanese. It can convey one of the following
    things:Hearsay:伝聞- Highlighting things that have been heard from other people.Appearance:様態- Highlighting
    the way that things 'appear', or 'seem'.Theappearancenuance is covered in another lesson, so we will
    focus onhearsayin this grammar point. When used to repeat statements that have been heard from other
    people/sources, そうだ (or そうです) will be paired with the plain form of a verb orい-Adjective, or a noun/な-Adjectivefollowed
    byだ.そうだalways implies that the speaker is not 100% certain about the validity of the information that
    they are conveying. Due to this, it does not sound as confident as other expressions, likeようだ.CautionIn
    order to avoid confusion between theそうだthat is used for repeating information, and theそうだthat is used
    for making observations, the following differences will need to be memorized.Verbs -降るそうだ - Unaltered
    verb, そうだ that is repeating information.降りそうだ -conjunctive form, そうだ that is used for making observations.い-Adjectives-寒いそうだ
    - Unaltered adjective, そうだ that is repeating information.寒そうだ - い removed, そうだ that is used for making
    observations.Nouns andな-Adjectives-綺麗だそうだ - だ  is used before そうだ. This is repeating information.綺麗そうだ
    - No だ between theな-Adjectiveand そうだ. This is making an observation.
