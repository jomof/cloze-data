  writeup: けれども is the more formal (full version) of the conjunction particle けど . Like けど , it usually
    carries the meaning of 'but', but because of its formality, sounds a bit more like 'although', or
    'provided that'. It simply highlights that 'while thinking about (A), (B)'. Meaning that the (B) phrase
    is important, or needs to be considered.As can be seen from these examples, だ will be required when
    using this conjunction after a な-Adjective , or a noun.As a reminder, please see below for a list
    of the most casual form of 'but', to the most formal.Casual - けど - けども - けれど - けれども - が - Formal.Fun
    FactOriginally, けれども was thought to be a more feminine version of が . However, the modern けど is so
    common that it has lost all of the feminine nuance that came from けれども .CautionAs with けど (and other
    forms of 'but' in Japanese), the phrase after けれども will often be omitted if it is obvious, or the
    speaker does not want to say it.
  examples:
    - japanese: もう晩ご飯食べたけれども。
      english: I already ate dinner, but… (There's always room for dessert!)
    - japanese: 私はこの本が好きではないけれども、あなたは好きでしょう。
      english: I don't like this book, but you do, don't you?
    - japanese: トムに言ったけれども、トムは忘れました。
      english: I told that to Tom, but he forgot.
    - japanese: 掃除をしたけれども、まだ汚い。
      english: I cleaned, but it is still dirty.
    - japanese: 映画を見るのは楽しいけれども、チケットが高い。
