  writeup: 足 る, an う-Verb meaning 'to be sufficient', is often paired with に and either verbs or nouns
    in order to indicate that something is 'worthy of (A)', or 'enough for (A)'. This is quite a formal
    grammar structure, so is primarily seen in books, or may be used in speeches.に足る will follow verbs
    in their dictionary form , or nouns. As 足 る itself will always appear in the dictionary form , it
    must be followed by a second noun which it will be modifying as the thing that is or is not worthy
    of something.Cautionに足る may come after する, or immediately follow the noun that would usually have
    する added to it. The primary difference is that に足る following する will put more emphasis on the action
    of (A).CautionWhen wanting to say that something is 'not worth (A)', に足る will not appear as に 足 りない.
    In these cases, the following verb will need to be negated, not 足 る itself.
