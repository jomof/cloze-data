  writeup: 再びis anadverbthat means 'to repeat'. It is regularly translated as 'again', 'once more', or
    'a second time'. Usually,再びwill appear at the beginning of a sentence, before some sort of request
    or statement will be made about what needs to be repeated.Despite meaning 'to repeat',再びspecifically
    has the nuance of repeating something 'for the second time'. Because of this, it will not be used
    to highlight things that need to be repeated over and over again.CautionUnlike また, which is frequently
    used to express 'again',再びis quite formal, and will be seen far more often in books/articles, than
    it will be spoken.
