  writeup: Originally a mixture of thesentence ending particlesか, and な,かなevolved over time to become
    its own (singular) sentence ending particle, which roughly translates as 'I wonder if (A)?'.As it
    is asentence ending particle,かなcan be added to the end of almost any sentence.Combining the meaningsかand
    な, we can see whereかなgets its original meaning.かpresents questions (usually to other people), while
    な shows that a statement is related purely to the speaker's own thoughts/opinions. In this way,かなexpresses
    that the speaker's own thoughts are being questioned.Fun FactIn the past,かなwas thought of as being
    a fairly feminine way to express 'I wonder', and males tended to use phrases likeだろうかto express the
    same type of statement. However, in modern day Japanese,かなis used by both men and women equally.
