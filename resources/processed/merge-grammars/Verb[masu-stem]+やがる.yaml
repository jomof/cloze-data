  writeup: やがる is a colloquial usage of the auxiliary verb 上 がる 'to go up' or 'to be complete' that can
    be attached to the conjunctive form of verbs and will often be translated as 'to have the nerve to
    (A)', or 'to have the gall to do (A)'. It is primarily used by men in response to actions performed
    by others that bring about feelings of scorn or disdain.Alternatively, やがる may also be attached to
    the て-form of verbs, which is simply an abbreviation of ている+あがる as an auxiliary verb once again. The
    meaning however will be the same.
