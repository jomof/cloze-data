  writeup: お〜願うis ahumble speechexpression in Japanese used for making requests in the same way as お〜ください
    'please do (A)'. As with many other polite structures, the use of お will primarily appear with words
    of Japanese origin, while ご will be used for the majority Chinese-origin kanji compounds.願う itself
    is a う-Verb meaning 'to petition', and the literal translation is something like 'I petition that
    you do (A) for me', which sounds incredibly stiff in English, but gets the point across that someone
    is doing a favor for you.Naturally, due to being a polite sentence pattern,お〜願うwill almost always
    appear in it's ます-form,お〜願います.Interestingly, words of western origin, such as katakana loanwords,
    will often omit bothおandご, appearing simply with願うattached to the end.Caution - Asお〜願うis an even more
    polite way of saying お〜ください, or simply even just てください, it will rarely be used outside of formal circumstances,
    such as voice-overs giving instructions etc. If used in daily speech, it may come across as sarcasm.
