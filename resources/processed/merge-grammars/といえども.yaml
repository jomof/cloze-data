  writeup: といえども is a combination of the case-marking particle と, the hypothetical form of 言 う, 言 え, and
    the conjunction particle ども, which is used in much the same way as けれども, or ても. Due to this, despite
    the more literal translation of 'even if one were to say (A)', it is usually translated simply as
    'even if (A)', or 'although (A)'.といえども will be seen following nouns, い-Adjectives, or verbs in any
    of their standard form .といえども may also follow な-Adjectives, but だ will precede といえども in these cases.Despite
    the nuance being slightly different, といえども can be thought of as a very old-fashioned way of saying
    といっても. Due to といえども being old-fashioned, it is often used for emphasis and will frequently be paired
    with expressions like いくら, いかに, どんなに, etc.Fun FactAlthough very rarely used, sometimes いえども is seen
    as 雖 も. In these cases the kanji 雖 , which means 'however', is simply paired with も. This creates
    a slight difference between 'however even (A)', and the more modern 'even if one were to say (A)'.
    Despite this, the meanings are used interchangeably in modern times.
