  writeup: 上にis a grammar pattern that functions as a slightly formal way of saying 'and' in Japanese.
    It shows that something is 'in addition to (A)', 'as well as (A)', or 'besides (A)'. Literally, it
    simply shows that 'on top of (A), (B)'.上にmay be used after that standard form of verbs and い-Adjectives,
    な-Adjectives followed byな上に, and nouns followed byの上に. Occasionally, the に may be dropped from this
    structure, without changing the meaning at all.When it comes to な-Adjectives and nouns, it is also
    common to seeである上にused as a conjugation pattern.Caution -上にmust always be used to highlight qualities
    of things that are equivalent to each other. For example, a good thing and another good thing, or
    a bad thing and another bad thing.
