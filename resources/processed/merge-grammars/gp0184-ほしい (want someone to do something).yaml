  writeup: '## 1. 欲しい is used as an auxiliary with Verbて to mean ''want (someone) to do (something)''.
    When the experiencer wants a person X to do something, X is marked by に. 欲しい is not used if X has
    a higher status than the experiencer. Thus, the following sentence is not appropriate when the speaker
    is a student of Profesoor Yoshida''s. (See Related Expression, [2] for the correct sentence in that
    situation.)'
  formation: "## \n\n- Vて\n- ほしい\n- 話してほしい\n- Want (someone) to talk\n- 食べてほしい\n- Want (someone) to eat"
