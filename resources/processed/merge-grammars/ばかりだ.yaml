  writeup: Occasionally, theadverbial particleばかり is combined with verbs in theirattributive form, to
    show that (A) is the only thing that is occuring. It may also imply that (A) is happening 'more and
    more', or that 'it keeps on (A)'. This phrase utilizes ばかり's standard meaning of 'only', and combines
    it with theauxiliary verbだ(orです).As can be seen with these sentences, this use of ばかり is paired almost
    exclusively with verbs that describe some form of change (higher/lower, stronger/weaker, better/worse,
    faster/slower, etc).If the speaker would like to express further information in a (B) part of the
    sentence,だwill simply get changed to itsconjunctive formで, before continuing.CautionThis use of ばかり
    is primarily seen with negative trends. However, this is not a grammatical rule, and positive trends
    may also sometimes appear with ばかりだ.
