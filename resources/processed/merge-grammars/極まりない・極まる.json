    "writeup": "Seen as either 極まりない or 極まる , this grammar structure makes use of the core meaning of the う-Verb 極 まる 'to be at the extremity of (A)', and will most often be translated simply as 'extremely (A)'. In most cases, this grammar pattern will appear following words that indicate some kind of negative state or emotion.極まる will be used immediately following な-Adjectives, while 極まりない will come after こと when either a な-Adejctive or い-Adjective precedes it.In the case of な-Adjectives, it is not a requirement that 極まりない be preceded by なこと, and it is actually more common for it to directly follow the な-Adjective without な.Caution極まりない is not the negative form of 極まる , but the noun 極 まり 'the extremity' followed directly by the い-Adjective ない, with が omitted between them. This means that the more literal translation for the difference between the two would be something like the following.失礼 極 まりない - There is no limit to the rudeness of (A).失礼 極 まる - The rudeness of (A) goes to the limit.As can be seen, while the meanings are opposite in some sense, the actual nuance of (A) being 'extremely' something remains the same. The actual negative form of 極 まる would be 極まらない , and would mean that something does 'not go to the limit of (A)'.",
