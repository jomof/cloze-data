  writeup: Appearing most frequently at the beginning of sentences,ついis anadverbthat may be translated
    as 'accidentally', 'unconsciously', 'absentmindedly', or 'against one's better judgment'.ついwill often
    be paired with statements that useてしまう, to emphasize that something was unintentional.Fun FactAlthough
    'accidentally' is the most common meaning ofつい, it actually may be used to convey three different
    nuances. These are as follows:はからず - Something that is uncalculated.思わず - Something that is not thought
    about.距離がわずかなさま - A small gap/interval.In each of these meanings,ついkeeps a sense of time being the
    most important factor. Due to this,ついwill give the impression that whatever resulted in the 'accidental'
    action, will be something that happened momentarily. This is very close to the meaning of 'lapse'
    in English. 'a lapse in time', 'a lapse in judgment', 'a lapse in forethought'.
