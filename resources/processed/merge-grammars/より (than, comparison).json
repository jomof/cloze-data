    "writeup": "In N5, we learned about the use ofよりthat is seen when making comparisons inより〜のほうが. However, in this lesson, we will take a look at how thiscase marking particlecan be used by itself. When used alone, this particle expresses that (A) (a noun or verb) is being compared to (B) (a noun or verb that is regularly paired with an adjective). The word thatよりis directly attached to will always be 'less than' the comparison being made. However, the overall expression is used to describe that (B) is 'more' (something) than (A).CautionIn many textbooks,よりis taught as meaning 'more', but the word thatよりis attached to will actually be the thing that is 'less' (something). The word/quote that hasがattached to it will be the thing that is 'more' (adjective). This is particularly confusing whenよりis not directly attached to a word, something which is common in casual spoken language.In this sentence, because theがis attached toこれ,これis the thing that is 'more expensive'. Asよりis not actually directly connected to any other word, it therefore means thatこれis expensive, compared to 'other things'. When you seeよりlike this, just pretend that it says 'other things' before it.",
