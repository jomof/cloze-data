  writeup: As we have seen several times now, theauxiliary verbようだis frequently used with verbs, to express
    that the 'completion' of an action is the specific goal/wish of the speaker. It does this implicitly
    through the meaning of the kanji様'manner of doing'.ようにいのる(or祈る in its kanji form) is no different,
    and will imply that the speaker is praying for (A) to be done/completed. This comes from the meaning
    of theう-Verb祈る itself, which can be translated as 'to pray', or 'to beg'. Despite being able to be
    used when actually praying, this grammar point is used most often to express a 'hope'.In a similar
    way to otherようにstructures, ないように may also be used with祈る, to show that someone is praying for something
    'not' to happen.CautionHowever, 'unlike' otherようにstructures,ように祈るwill sometimes be shortened toようにby
    itself. This is especially true after ます.This is the onlyようにstructure that will have the verb that
    comes after it omitted. Therefore,ように(by itself) will always mean 'to hope for', and should not be
    confused withようにする,ようになる,ようにいう, and other similar grammar points.Fun Factといいis also used to express
    'to hope for (A)', or 'to wish for (A)'. However, unlikeように祈る, the person that the speaker is praying
    for withといいwill mainly be determined by the use ofね(praying for someone else), or な (praying for themselves).
