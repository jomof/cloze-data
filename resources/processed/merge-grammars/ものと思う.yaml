  writeup: 物と思うis made up of thenoun物'thing', thecase marking particleと, and the う-Verb思う 'to think'.
    Regular translations include 'to believe that (A)', or 'to have confidence that (A)'. In a broader
    sense, this grammar pattern is just making use of one of the meanings of物as being something abstract
    that the speaker can reliably determine has all of the qualities of something concrete.As もの is a
    noun, this pattern may follow any word in itsattributive form.When思う appears in the past tense, the
    most common translation is 'as I had believed was true of (A)', or 'I was under the impression that
    (A)'.Although this grammar construction is slightly formal, it may occasionally be heard in daily
    speech.
