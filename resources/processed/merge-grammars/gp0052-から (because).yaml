  writeup: から can have several different meanings in Japanese, depending on which part of the sentence
    it is in, and what comes before/after it. It is often translated as 'because', or 'since'. In these
    cases, it just means 'Because of (A), (B)'.から may be used with almost any type of word, but when the
    nuance is 'because', it will require だ before it when following a noun or な-Adjective .Despite having
    several different nuances, it may be easier to think of から as meaning 'from' in all situations, as
    that is the base nuance.From (A as a reason), (B) = Because/Since.From (A as a location), (B) = From.Fun
    Factから is a special type of particle in Japanese called a case marking particle . These are particles
    that describe the relationship that (A) and (B) exist in. We will learn more about these soon!

  writeup: '## 1. Sentence から represents a reason or a cause. Thus, Sentence1 から Sentence2 corresponds
    to ''Sentence2 because/since S1'', ''Because/since Sentence1, Sentence2'', or ''Sentence1, so Sentence2''.
    Note that the order of Sentence1 and Sentence2 is not always the same in English, while in Japanese
    から clauses (i.e., Sentence1) always precede main clauses (i.e., Sentence2).'
