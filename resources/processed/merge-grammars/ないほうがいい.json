    "writeup": "Like たほうがいい , ないほうがいい is used in Japanese for giving advice. However, this expression suggests that it is better 'not' to do something.This phrase is constructed by using the negative form of a verb grouped with 方 , the particle が , and the い-Adjective , いい .As 方 can be translated closely to 'way', or 'direction', this expression is suggesting that one specific choice is simply the better 'way'.This expression is quite direct, and can imply that there may be some sort of negative consequence if the (A) verb is done.",
