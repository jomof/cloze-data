  writeup: のです is a construction with several different forms, each meaning roughly the same thing. This
    expression behaves similarly to だ and です by themselves (asserting that something is true). However,
    the addition of の strengthens the relationship being highlighted. Due to this, it will come across
    a bit like 'it is a fact that (A)' in English.In these sentences, we can think of the ん , or の as
    simply adding emphasis to the statement. Due to の adding emphasis, this expression will be heard very
    frequently in explanations.CautionThere is no real difference between ん and の . Only の is considered
    'correct Japanese', but ん evolved to make things easier to say. ん is the most common form in spoken
    Japanese, and the use of の could be considered a bit formal, or 'stiff'.While both the だ and です forms
    are equally as natural, only the です form will be used if adding か to the end 〜んです か . This construction
    shows that the speaker is looking for an explanation about something.
  examples:
    - japanese: いいんですか。
      english: Is it good?
    - japanese: 赤がいいんですか。
      english: Is red good?
    - japanese: いいのですか。
      english: Is it good?
    - japanese: これがいいのですか。
      english: Is this good?
    - japanese: 川があるんです。
      english: There is a river.

  writeup: '## 1. In conversation, のだ/です often becomes んだ/です. In informal speech, male speakers use んだ
    and female speakers use の. (For the informal forms of のだ in interrogative sentences, see かい and だい.)
    2. Basically, Sentenceのだ is used when the speaker is explaining or asking for an explanation about
    information shared with the hearer. The information is often what the speaker and the hearer have
    observed or heard. For example, in Key Sentences, A uses のです because he is asking for an explanation
    about what he sees B doing. B also uses のです because he is explaining his actions. In this situation,
    (1) is odd. (1) A: 何をしていますか。 What are you doing? B: 日本語を勉強しています。 I''m studying Japanese. If, however,
    A is only assuming that B is doing something, A can ask the question in (2), and B can answer as B
    does in (1). (2) あなたは今何をしていますか。 What are you doing now? In Example (a), as in Key Sentence, A uses
    んです because A observes that B isn''t drinking sake and wants an explanation for that. And, B also
    uses んです because he is explaining about what A observed. In Example (b), the speaker uses んです in the
    second sentence because it is an explanation about the information which has been given in the first
    sentence. 3. Sentenceのだ is also used when no information is shared by the speaker and the hearer and
    the speaker is not explaining or asking for an explanation about anything. In this case, the speaker
    is talking as if some information were shared with the hearer and the effects of this are, for example,
    (A) to involve the hearer in the affairs he is talking about (See (3) and (4) below.), and/or (B)
    to impose his idea upon the hearer or, at least, to emphasize his idea emotively. (See (5) below.)
    Examples: (3) 今日フットボールがあるんですが一緒に行きませんか。 There is a football game today. Wouldn''t you like to go (together)
    with me? (4) 先生、困っているんです。助けてください。 Teacher, I''m in trouble. Please help me. (5) 日本語の文法は難しいですがおもしろいんですよ。
    Japanese grammar is difficult, but it is interesting, you know.'
