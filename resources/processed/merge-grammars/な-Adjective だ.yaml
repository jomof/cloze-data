  writeup: A predicate is a word that describes the topic/subject of a sentence. The Japanese equivalent
    of this is a 述語 , which literally means 'statement word'. As a predicate , な-Adjectives can appear
    by themselves (when the word they are describing does not need to be stated), or they may be used
    at the end of a sentence.It is important to remember that all な-Adjectives can also function as nouns,
    and therefore tend to sound more like a noun than an adjective, when used as a predicate .When there
    are no other words apart from the adjective itself, it comes across similarly to 'It's pretty', or
    'It's hated', and similar expressions in English. We just have to guess what the 'it' is from context.CautionUnlike
    い-Adjectives , な-Adjectives change form depending on where they are in the sentence. At the end of
    a sentence, they will always be followed by だ , or です (except in casual conversation where だ is omitted).
    However, when used before the word they are describing, they will always be followed by な . Hence
    the name な-Adjectives .In many sentences, eitherはorがcould be used to mark the word/words that thepredicateis
    describing. Which one sounds more natural will depend on many factors. In general, if you are specifically
    pointing out something as being different from other things in the same category,がwill be used.In
    this example, が is distinguishing a specific station as having a unique level of dirtiness compared
    to others. は would sound unnatural in this type of sentence.Fun FactMost な-Adjectives are words of
    foreign (Chinese/English) origin.
  examples:
    - japanese: 夜の海は静かだ。夜の海は静かです。
      english: The night sea is quiet.
    - japanese: さいきさんは親切だ。さいきさんは親切です。
      english: Saiki is kind.
    - japanese: 彼は静かだ。彼は静かです。
      english: He is quiet.
    - japanese: 私は暇だ。私は暇です。
      english: I am free.
    - japanese: 海が綺麗だ。海が綺麗です。
      english: The sea is beautiful.
