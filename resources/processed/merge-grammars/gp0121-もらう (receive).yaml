  writeup: もらう is the 3rd verb that is regularly taught together with くれる , and あげる . It is used to highlight
    that (A) is 'received' by someone. However, unlike くれる and あげる (which are used to highlight that something
    is 'given'), もらう requires the に particle (or から ) to mark the giver, not the recipient. が or は may
    be used to mark the recipient, as they are the one performing the action of receiving. を will mark
    the object that is being given.In the second sentence we can see that the recipient has been omitted,
    while in the third example, the giver was omitted. This is a regular occurrence when using もらう , as
    the receiver is usually obvious, or the 'giver' may not be important to the overall meaning of the
    sentence.In this example, the thing that was given is the focus, while the speaker does not consider
    the 'giver' something that needs to be mentioned. Sometimes, for very simple sentences with clear
    context, neither the 'giver', nor the 'receiver' needs to be mentioned.

  writeup: '## 1. もらう, which is one of a set of giving and receiving verbs, means ''get''. Unlike the
    English get, however, もらう is used only when the receiver is the first person or someone with whom
    the speaker empathizes (usually a member of the speaker''s in-group). Thus, (1) is unacceptable.'
