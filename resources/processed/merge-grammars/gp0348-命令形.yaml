  writeup: In Japanese, there are numerous ways to express an order, command, or instruction. The most
    direct, abrasive, and therefore least used method is called theimperative form, which happens to be
    one of the basic conjugations of verbs.Without particles following it, the imperative form is fairly
    uncommon in daily life, but will often be seen on traffic signs, posters, or banners. In addition,
    it can be also heard shouted at demonstrations, when cheering at sports events, or in urgent situations,
    such as an officer yelling at a suspect to stop.Verbs are conjugated into the imperative form in the
    following way. For う-Verbs, simply replace the last kana of any verb with the equivalent え sound kana
    from the same row. For る-Verbs, replace る with either ろ or よ.The imperative form may sometimes be
    softened with the particleよ. This is a pattern which is mostly used by men that are familiar with
    each other, in order to offer advice or encouragement. Women tend to use the more politeて-formof verbs
    instead.Any verb except for ある and いる may be conjugated to the imperative form, due to their meanings
    being based on existence and nothing more.Fun-fact- Theなさい, polite imperative that comes fromなさるis
    mostly used by teachers and parents talking to their children. It is also often used in instructions
    on  test papers. When speaking to animals, the politeprefixお plus the ます-stem will also occasionally
    be used.Fun FactOriginally, よ was used instead of ろ with る-Verbs. Despite this, with time it has been
    gradually losing popularity, and nowadays it is considered to be a more formal, written variant.
