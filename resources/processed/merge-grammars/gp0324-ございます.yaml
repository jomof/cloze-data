    使用域: 敬語
  writeup: ございますis a combination of the (special-class) verb,ござる(御座るin its kanji form), and theauxiliary
    verbます. It is consideredpolite speech, and is directly equivalent toある(orいる).ござるitself is almost never
    used in daily conversation in modern Japanese, due to the preference of the polite form,ございます. However,ござるis
    regularly used in dramas, manga, and other forms of media (especially historical dramas).Fun Fact御座る
    literally means 'to be', and it does not matter whether the object that is being described is animate
    (would usually use いる), or inanimate (would usually use ある). However,いらっしゃる'to be' is preferred when
    referring to other people, ashonorific languageis more respectful thanpolite speech. Due to this,ございますwill
    often be used in reference to people, in place of であります (the polite form ofである).Notice thatでis used
    in these examples.でございますitself is considered its own grammatical structure, that we will examine in
    a separate grammar point.
