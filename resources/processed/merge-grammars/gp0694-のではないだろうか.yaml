  writeup: のではないだろうかis a fairly long grammar pattern in Japanese that is used when one wants to express
    their opinion indirectly, in the form of a rhetorical question. Common translations include 'I think
    it's (A), isn't it?', and 'it might be that (A)'. However, being that this is just a combination of
    の, ではない 'isn't', だろう 'probably', and か, the literal meaning is simply 'is it probably not that it's
    (A)'. Just like in English, the elongation of the phrase and not saying anything with certainty makes
    it sound more modest.のではないだろうかmay be seen following verbs and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns
    when preceded with な. Additionally, でしょう may replace だろう.This phrase can also be used when seeking
    agreement from the listener, or when mildly trying to persuade them that your way of thinking may
    be correct.
