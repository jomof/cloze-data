  writeup: くらい or ぐらい (more common in spoken language) has several different uses in Japanese, but is
    often translated as 'about', or 'approximately'. It comes from the kanji 位 , which literally means
    a 'rank', or 'grade' of something. This use of くらい comes after numbers, or counter words.As can be
    seen in the last example, くらい may also be used after question words such as どの , when asking about
    the extent (grade) of something.Due to the original meaning of くらい being 'rank', or 'extent', it may
    not be used when referring to broad periods of time. ころ will be used in these situations. However,
    くらい and ころ may be used interchangeably when referring to a specific time (due to a specific time being
    able to be thought of as an extent).CautionPlease see the ころ grammar point if you would like to compare
    these two structures further.
