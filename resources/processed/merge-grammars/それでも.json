    "writeup": "それでもis a combination of thepronounそれ, and theadverbial particleでも. It is often translated simply as 'even so', or 'nevertheless'. Literally, it is a bit closer to 'even with that'.それでもis usually used between an (A) and a (B) phrase, to show that there is more information (usually surprising) to be considered.This grammar point primarily expresses that 'even with' what has been said previously, it is not all there is to think about.",
