    Register: Formal
    使用域: 硬い
  writeup: A fairly old-fashioned phrase,上はhighlights that something is being done or considered as a
    result of (A). It may be interpreted as 'once (A), (B)', 'since (A), (B)', 'now that (A), (B)', or
    'as long as (A), (B)'. In these meanings, (B) will always be something that is deemed as either obvious
    or necessary.上in this phrase is anoun, and will be attached to theadverbial particleは. This creates
    a literal meaning that is similar to 'over and above (A), (B)'. This 'over and above' has a similar
    nuance to 'with that said', or 'all things considered' in English, and just presents (A) as something
    that is finalized.This structure follows verbs in thestandard form.Due to上はbeing quite old-fashioned,
    expressions likeからにはor以上はwill be heard more frequently in modern-day Japanese, and will carry a similar
    meaning.
