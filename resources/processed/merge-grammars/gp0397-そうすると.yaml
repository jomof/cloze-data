  writeup: そうすると, a combination of然う (an adverb meaning 'like that', or 'as such') する and theconjunction
    particleと, expresses that 'once (A) was done, (B)', or 'upon (A), (B)'.そうするとis usually used at the
    beginning of a new sentence, to highlight something that occurred due to the circumstances mentioned
    in the previous sentence/statement.As a stand-alone statement,そうするとis classified as aconjunction.CautionThe
    'result' thatそうするとconveys, should always be one of two specific things. Something that the speaker
    has no control over, or a conclusion/determination that the speaker wants to confirm is correct (based
    on their understanding of the previous statement).Whenそうするとis used to draw a conclusion about another
    person's statement, the translation is closer to 'so you mean to say (A)', or 'if so, then (A)'.Fun
    FactAlthough然う has a kanji form, this particular word will almost always be written in hiragana. This
    is true for many different expressions that use そう, not justそうすると.
