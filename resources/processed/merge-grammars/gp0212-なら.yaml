  writeup: As mentioned in our lesson aboutば,ならis often used by itself to mean 'if'. This is considered
    to be an abbreviation ofならば, thehypotheticalform of なり, aclassical auxiliary verbthat is not used
    much in modern Japanese.Because なり originally meant 'to be', it functions in a similar way to theauxiliary
    verbだ. This means that it regularly pairs with nouns, or phrases that have beennominalized(become
    noun-like), through the use ofの.However, unlikeだ(orです),ならis also regularly used without the extra
    help ofのfor nominalization, and can be attached directly to verbs orい-Adjectives.CautionBecauseならis
    an abbreviation ofならば, it is strictly used when making guesses about what 'may', or what 'could' happen
    in certain situations. This means that it will not be used as 'if' in statements about results that
    are produced through some sort of effort/training.Fun FactAlthoughならcomes from theclassical auxiliary
    verbなり, it should not be confused with the particle なり, which often has the meaning of 'as soon as',
    or 'just after'. Thankfully, the particle なり is also quite uncommon in modern Japanese.
