  writeup: と言おうかis an expression that combines thecase-marking particleと in itsquotationuse, the volitional
    form of the う-Verb言う,言おう ‘to say’, and theadverbial particleか used for mid-sentence questions. It
    may be translated as ‘how to put it’, or ‘perhaps it’s (A), or perhaps it’s (B)’. However, the more
    literal ‘shall I say it is (A), or shall I say it is (B)’ is also a common interpretation.This expression
    will be used twice, where both the (A) and the (B) phrase are being questioned by the speaker. As
    with many other uses of と of aquotation, the preceding word may be almost anything.と言おうかis interchangeable
    with the more common と言うか, but it is advisable to only use it when specific emphasis needs to be made,
    or for some type of dramatic effect. In many cases, it will sound unnatural in daily speech.と言おうかwill
    frequently be used with fairly vague or imprecise descriptions, in order to avoid but hint at what
    the speaker actually wants to say. Often, this will be something negative, and will therefore be omitted.
