    Register: Standard
    使用域: 一般
  writeup: In addition to 'passive' verbs,れるandられる(theauxiliary verbs) are used when expressing possibility
    '可能'.られるwill be attached to the base form ofる-Verbs(the form after る has been removed). Note also
    thatれるandられるthemselves behave like standard る-Verbs, so can be conjugated into a variety of different
    tenses in the same way as a standard verb.A common sight in modern Japanese is words where the ら may
    be removed, 'ラ抜き言葉', andれるmay be used by itself. However, this is not technically correct Japanese,
    and may cause confusion in cases where ら is required (withる-Verbsandくる, whenられるis expressing 'passivity',
    'respect', or 'spontaneous occurrence').Forう-Verbs, they will behave a little differently. Instead
    of the final kana of the verb changing to an あ sound, and then adding れる (as would be the case withpassiveverbs),
    the final kana of the verb will change to an え sound (る will become れ, う will become え, す will become
    せ, etc.) before adding る.Interestingly,するverbs do not have a 'potential' form, and the verbできるwill
    be used in its place.Cautionことができるandられる(when used in its 'potential' meaning) have exactly the same
    nuance. However, many people considerことができるto be slightly more polite.Fun FactWhen using thepotentialform,
    eitherをorがmay be used to mark the 'object'. You will need to be careful though, as this does not apply
    toできる, which may only ever useが.
