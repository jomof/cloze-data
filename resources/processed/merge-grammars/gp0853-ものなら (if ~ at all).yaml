  writeup: Often seen after the potential form of verbs is theconjunction particleものなら. This grammar pattern
    expresses that while (A) is not thought to be possible, if it were possible, (B). Common translations
    include 'if (A), (B)', if one could (A), (B)', and 'if (A) were possible, (B)'.Asものならis just a combination
    of もの and thehypothetical formof だ (なら),ものならsimply states that if (A) were a 'thing', then (B).Due
    toものならregularly expressing a desired outcome in the (B) part of sentences, this grammar structure
    will usually be accompanied by てみる or てみたい. Additionally, もし may also appear at the beginning of the
    sentence to further increase the nuance of 'if'.てみる is often used for criticism, suggesting that if
    someone thinks that (A) were possible, then perhaps they should try it. てみたい on the other hand is
    more commonly seen when (A) is wished for, and the speaker would like to do it if possible.While not
    a strict rule, the verb in both the (A) and (B) parts ofものならsentences is frequently the same. Especially
    when expressing a desire to do (A).
