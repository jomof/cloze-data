  writeup: しかもis a conjunction in Japanese which is commonly translated as either 'furthermore', or 'moreover'.
    This is a somewhat formal grammar pattern which indicates that both (A) and (B) exist at the same
    time, or are in unison.しかもitself focuses on the overall topic, so will be used for giving objective
    opinions, such as observable facts, rather than personal opinions.Asしかもis a conjunction, it may be
    used between two phrases, or sometimes at the beginning of a second sentence, when referring back
    to the first.Often, (A) will be considered the 'base' information, while (B) is extra information
    added on top of (A), or further explaining (A).Fun-fact - Originally,しかもcame from the combination
    of the archaic interjection然'as such', or 'like that', and the particle も 'too', or 'also'. In this
    way, some reflection can be seen between it and modern English phrases like 'additionally', where
    the (B) information is simply adding on to what is already known about (A).Fun-fact - In modern writing,しかもmay
    also appear as either而もor併も, although both are quite rare.

    - japanese: このテレビは画質がめちゃくちゃいい。しかも、受信機がついていないから受信料を払わなくてもいい。
