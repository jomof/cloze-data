    "writeup": "To express that actions are beginning, or ending in Japanese, the verbs始める(to commence), or終わる(to end) will need to be used. In this lesson, we will focus on actions that are 'ending'.To say that (A) is ending/finishing, we will need to attachおわるto the ます stem of almost any verb. Whether you use the hiragana form, or the kanji form does not matter, as there will be no change in nuance.Due toおわるbeing a verb itself, the tense can be changed to show that something will end, is ending, or has ended.CautionUnlikeはじめる, which uses the transitive form,終わるuses the intransitive form of its transitive/intransitive pair. This is due to most actions in Japanese being considered to be things that 'come to an end' naturally (intransitive), rather than forcefully (transitive). However, there are exceptions to this, and終える (the transitive version) may also be seen used as an auxiliary to other verbs.",
