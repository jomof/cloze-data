  writeup: In order to express that someone was 'made to do', or 'let do' something, theauxiliary verbsせるandさせるwill
    be used. The meaning thatせるandさせるwill convey (when attached to a verb) is called使役(causative, employment,
    or using) in Japanese.A common misconception is thatせるandさせるare standard conjugations of each verb.
    However, theseauxiliary verbsshould be thought of as having their own meaning, in a similar way to
    howたい, ない,だ,です, and other auxiliaries each have their own meanings.In order to use these grammar structures,
    remove the る fromる-Verbs, and then addさせる. Forう-Verbs, change the last kana to the あ sound kana from
    within the same column (except for う, which becomes わ), and then add せる (る becomes ら, む becomes ま,
    く becomes か, etc.).As usual,するand来るhave special conjugation rules.するwill be replaced completely byさせる(in
    a similar way to howできるcompletely replacesするin the 'potential' form).来るwill become来させる.CautionWith
    causative, eitherに, orをcan mark the doer of the action that せる, or させる is linked to (not が). This
    is because the actual 'doer' of the action is considered to be the person that is making/letting someone
    perform that action.にwill usually imply that someone was 'let' do something, whileをimplies 'make'.Fun
    FactBecause the actual 'doer' in causative verb sentences will be marked withが(as is always the case),
    the literal translation ofせるandさせるis closer to the following:(A) が (B)に楽しませる- For (A) to cause fun
    'in' (B).(A) が (B)を楽しませる- For (A) to cause fun 'through' (B).It is these standard meanings of the
    particlesに(a location) andを(a target) that will create the 'let', or 'make' nuance when usingせる, orさせる.

  writeup: |-
    ## 1. The idea that someone/something (= the causer) causes or allows someone/something (= the causee) to do something is expressed by the causative construction. In the causative construction, the causer is usually marked by は in main clauses and by が in subordinate clauses. When the main verb is an intransitive verb, the causee is marked by either を or に. The choice between the two particles depends on the following general rule. When に is used, the causee has taken an action intentionally. For example, に is ungrammatical in (1) because the causee didn't intend to go to the party in this situation.
