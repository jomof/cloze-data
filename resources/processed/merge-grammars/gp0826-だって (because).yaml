  writeup: だってis a colloquial combination of theauxiliary verbだ, and theadverbial particleとて in Japanese
    (a combination of the particles と, and て). It has a wide range of uses, but primarily exclaims that
    something is the 'premise' for whatever has been said, or will be said next. This 'exclamation' is
    usually translated as 'I heard', 'cause', 'but', or 'even if'. The meaning that will be conveyed is
    determined primarily by whereだってappears in a sentence.When placed at the beginning of a sentence,だってhighlights
    the speaker's (usually) displeasure about something that has just been said, before following it with
    an explanation or counterpoint. Thisだってis quite similar toでも.At the end of a sentence,だってis used to
    express hearsay, in a similar way to 'I heard that', or 'it was said that', in English. In these cases
    it will be preceded by なん. なんだって always appears after a noun, or a phrase that has been nominalized
    (with の or こと).CautionWhen used directly after a noun, だって has a similar nuance to the だって that appears
    at the beginning of sentences (emphasizing what has come before it, in order to explain further).
    This comes across asでも, and may not be used with なん.Fun FactTheadverbial particleとて itself is an abbreviation
    of expressions like と言って, and と思って. だとて (the full construction) may also be used, but is almost always
    replaced by だって, as it is far easier to say.Fun FactWhen used at the beginning of a sentence, もん or
    もの will often come at the end of that sentence, in order to strengthen the opinion given by the speaker.
    This is more commonly used by women and children.
