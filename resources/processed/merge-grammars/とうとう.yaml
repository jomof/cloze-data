  writeup: とうとうis an adverb that is used to express that something 'finally' happens. In Japanese, there
    are a few ways to do this, butとうとうis one of the more common. Coming from the kanji到頭, this structure
    literally means 到 (to arrive at), 頭 (the head of/crux of) something. Due to this, 'finally', and 'after
    all' are the two most common translations ofとうとう. Like many other adverbs in Japanese,とうとうis often
    used at the beginning of a phrase/sentence.Whileとうとうis written in hiragana the majority of the time,
    knowing the kanji will help when trying to remember the expression's nuance. That nuance is that something
    has 'ended', usually after some sort of long journey/effort.This adverb may be used to express either
    positive or negative outcomes, as it focuses more on the time required to achieve the result, rather
    than the result being good or bad.Cautionとうとうis not used in situations where you expect something
    to happen/start, but there has not actually been a period of time in which some sort of effort was
    made to achieve a result.A good example of this is the changing of seasons. You might want to say
    'finally, it's summer!', but this is not something that anyone has done anything to achieve. Rather,
    it came naturally. In these cases,いよいよwill be used, and has the nuance of 'finally', or 'at last'
    (in relation to something starting/happening).
