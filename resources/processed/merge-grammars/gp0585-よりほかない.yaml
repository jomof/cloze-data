  writeup: Used in a similar way to しかない,より他ないis a structure that emphasizes that only (A) is possible,
    when attached to the end of verbs. This grammar pattern is a combination of thecase marking particleより
    'than', or 'from', the noun他'other', and the い-Adjective, ない. From this it can be translated directly
    as 'there is nothing other than (A)'. However, the emphasis is usually on the impossibility of doing
    anything other than (A), rather than the existence of nothing else.Common interpretations include
    'to have no choice but to (A)', 'there is no other way than (A)', or simply 'have to (A)'.Occasionally,  the
    particles に, は, or a combination of both as には may come between他and ない. While this does not change
    the meaning, it does further emphasize the point that there is no choice but (A).
