  writeup: Remembering thatするhas no potential form, the replacement る - Verb できる 'to amount to' will often
    be used in conjunction with particles, to indicate whether the possibility of amounting to something
    exists. Theconjunction particlesばorたらwill most frequently be used.できればandできたらare usually translated
    simply as 'if possible'.Bothできればandできたらwill come at the start of a sentence, before the following
    statement will express some (desired) outcome.CautionAsばandたらare the only 'hypothetical' indicators
    that can express the process toward potential outcomes, usingならor と would be be illogical. This can
    be visualized as follows:(A) できると - Will express the result after achieving (A), not what is required
    to get there.(A) できるなら - Asならis just thehypothetical formof だ, It is used to make guesses about what
    could happen if the situation of (A) exists, not how that situation can be used to produce some other
    result.
