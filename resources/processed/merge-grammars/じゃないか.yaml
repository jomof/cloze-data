  writeup: When learningじゃないandではない, we briefly mentioned that these constructions are regularly partnered
    with the particleか, in order to form a (usually casual) question. In this lesson, we will further
    explore this usage.Unlikeじゃないandではない(which need to come after a noun orな-Adjective),じゃないかis able to
    be attached to the end of almost any phrase, to indicate a question. This is very similar to finishing
    a sentence with 'isn't it?' in English.Whenじゃないかis too casual,ではないかwill be used instead. Despite being
    more formal, this may sound a bit stiff at times, so is best only used when politeness is expected.
