  writeup: いわゆる, occasionally seen in its kanji form所謂, is a word that is used before nouns to indicate
    that something is 'what is called (A)', 'the so-called (A)', or 'generally known as (A)'.いわゆるis a
    combination of いわ, a modern variant of いは, the indeterminate form of言う 'to say', and ゆる, which is
    the classical literary equivalent of theauxiliary verbれる, the displacement verb indicator in its attributive
    form. In this way, the literal meaning of 'what is said to be (A)' is carried over into the English
    translations.Fun-fact - The kanji for謂means 'oral tradition', and highlights the way that something
    is referred to over the course of different time periods, or in different places.
