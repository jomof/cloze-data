    "writeup": "The negative form of い-Adjectives in Japanese is created by using the conjunctive form of the adjective, followed by ない . conjunctive form just means 'agglutinative', or 'conjunctive' in Japanese. For い-Adjectives , this conjunctive form is created by removing い, and replacing it with く.The ない used with い-Adjectives is considered to be a different word to the ない used with verbs. When used with い-Adjectives , ない itself is also an い-Adjective . This means that it follows the same rules as regular い-Adjectives . Due to ません (the polite negative form) being an auxiliary verb ,  it cannot be conjugated with い-Adjectives in the same way as verbs.As can be seen here, you must first add the verb ある , and then conjugate it into its negative form using the auxiliary verb ません. This is how the polite negative is created.CautionAs with regular い-Adjectives , you cannot use だ after ない . です is acceptable to create a semi-polite form, but is best used in spoken language only.",
