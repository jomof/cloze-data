  writeup: がちis asuffixin Japanese that will be used after nouns, or theconjunctive formof verbs. It conveys
    that someone is 'apt to (A)', 'tends to (A)', or 'is prone to (A)'. Although not always negative,がちis
    most frequently used to express negative tendencies.Fun Factがちas a grammar structure comes from the
    word勝ち, meaning 'a win'.勝ち in itself is used to express something that appears 'repeatedly', or 'again
    and again'. Due to this,がちmay be thought of as similar to 'to win out' in English, meaning that 'although
    there are many possibilities, (A) winning out is the most likely'. This 'winning out' may be due to
    preference, or sheer good/bad luck.
