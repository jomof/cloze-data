  writeup: Although several grammar patterns make use of the う-Verb限る 'to limit',限りmay be the most versatile.
    This is partly because it does not include に like other限る based structures, and therefore will have
    its meaning modified by the word that comes directly before it.限り will follow verbs in their standard
    forms, and nouns linked to である. Let's take a look at a few of the standard meanings and translations.The
    first meaning indicates that (B) is something that is limited to being within the scope of (A). This
    is the most standard meaning and can be translated as 'limited to (A), (B)'.The second meaning highlights
    that within the limit or scope of some particular source of information, (B) is true. This scope usually
    relates to the senses (like vision), or to knowledge. This may be interpreted as 'as far as (A), (B)',
    'as long as (A), (B)'.The third and final meaning of限り will imply that 'limited to (A) being the case,
    (B) will occur'. In this nuance,限り simply implies that assuming that (A) is true, (B) is something
    that will need to be taken into account as well. This will be interpreted as 'while (A) is the case,
    (B)', or 'assuming (A), (B)'.Despite these various meanings,限る will always highlight (A) as the limit
    or constraint within which the logic of (B) exists.
