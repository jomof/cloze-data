    "writeup": "Whenて(orでwhen following ない) is paired with the past form of theい-Adjective,いい;てよかった,なくてよかった, orないでよかったwill have the meaning of 'I'm glad that (A)' (when positive), or 'I'm glad that I didn't (A)' (when negative).The primary difference betweenなくてよかったandないでよかったin this expression, is thatないでよかったwill be used far more frequently in casual speech. Comparatively,なくてよかったtends to be reserved for books, and may even be considered old-fashioned by some people.",
