  writeup: Like際に'on the occasion of (A)',に際してwill be used to show some particular occasion, and is used
    most frequently in regard to one-off events, or chance occurrences. However, unlike際に,に際してis a combination
    of に, and the て-form of際する, which is a verb that usually has the meaning of 'to come to pass'.Despite
    the more literal translation of 'when (A) comes to pass',に際してwill often just be interpreted as 'on
    the occasion of (A)', or 'at the time of (A)'. This is a formal grammar pattern that is seen connected
    either to nouns, or verbs in their dictionary form.Caution - While there are many similarities between際にandに際して,
    a few key differences exist. The first being thatに際してis primarily used when (B) is something that
    will be done before (A), or when presented with the situation of (A). However, in the case of際に, the
    nuance is more specifically 'on the occasion of (A)', marking the exact point in time, rather than
    the approach to that time.Following on from this example, becauseに際してhighlights the approach to a
    specific situation, it will never appear connected to verbs in the past tense.際に, on the other hand,
    frequently appears with verbs in the past tense, as it can highlight the 'occasion' of an action being
    complete.
