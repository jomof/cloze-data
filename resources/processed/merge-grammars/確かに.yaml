  writeup: 確かにis the adverbial use of the な-Adjective確か, meaning 'to be certain', or 'to be assured'.
    It may be used in the same way as 'certainly' or 'surely' in English, especially when the speaker
    wants to highlight (A) is definitely the case.Caution -確かにas 'certainly' is only used for verifying
    information, and does not carry the nuance of giving permission, as it does in English.Caution - When
    the に is removed,確か is often used in a similar way to 'if I remember correctly', 'if I'm not mistaken',
    or 'now that you mention it'.
