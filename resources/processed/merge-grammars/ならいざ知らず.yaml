  writeup: ならいざ知らずis a grammar expression which combines thehypothetical formof the auxiliary verb だ,
    なら, the adverb いざ ‘now’, or ‘well then’, and the classically-negated form of the う-Verb知る,知らず ‘to
    not know’. It is often translated as ‘I don’t know about (A), but (B)’, or ‘maybe (A), but (B). This
    phrase is formal, and usually used to emphasize that, regardless of (A), (B) fits a specific description.ならいざ知らずwill
    follow verbs in theirstandard forms. Additionally, it may follow either な-Adjectives or nouns that
    have had their terminal だ replaced with なら.Just like the literal translation of ‘if it’s (A), well
    then I don’t know’, this structure emphasizes that (A) may or may not be the case, but (B) is definite.
    However, there is no direct use of ‘but’ in Japanese. This shows that the ‘but’ comes from the simple
    contrast of (A) being unknown while (B) is known.ならいざ知らずmay also be seen following other structures
    such as い-Adjectives when they have been nominalized with の.This の pattern is also used with verbs,
    but it is less common than simply attaching ならいざしらず to one of the standard verb forms.Fun FactIn many
    cases, (A) is an extreme example used to show that (B) is the opposite of that, and is therefore either
    surprising or irritating.CautionOccasionally は will be used instead of なら. However, the meaning of
    the overall phrase will remain the same.
