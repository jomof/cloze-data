  writeup: 更にis word that is often used adverbially in Japanese to convey the meaning of 'more and more',
    'even more than (A)', or 'again'. This use is an extension of the base meaning that the kanji更has
    in indicating that something is 'approaching change'. Because of this, the expression used following更にwill
    always be something that is either further along than the initial statement either in regard to time,
    quantity, or volume. Taking this into consideration, 'in addition to (A)' may also be used as a fairly
    standard translation.Asさらにis used adverbially, it often appears at the beginning of part (B) of a
    sentence, after the 'base' information has already been indicated.Fun-fact - The meaning of更as 'approaching
    change' merely indicates that something has already reached 'fullness', and anything more than that
    will cause a fundamental change in the state of (A). Due to this, さらに primarily indicates things where
    (A) is considered 'complete' or 'enough' in and of itself, and what happens in (B) pushes that thing
    beyond a certain threshold. This may be either positive or negative depending on the sentence.
