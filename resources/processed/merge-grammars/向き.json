    "writeup": "向きis anothernounin Japanese that is frequently used as asuffix.向きcomes from the intransitive verb向く, meaning 'to face'. This word is often attached to the end of other nouns, in order to show that something is 'facing (A)', or 'suitable for (A)'.Due to向きbeing intransitive, it usually implies that something is facing toward (A) naturally, or through chance. Because of this, it may convey that something is 'suitable for (A)', but not necessarily designed specifically for it.Caution向け, coming from the transitive verb向ける is used far more often to express that something has been specifically designed for (A).When comparing向きand向け, the primary difference is that向きconveys that something is 'appropriate for (A)', while向け is closer to 'intended for (A)'.",
