  writeup: どころかis a combination of thenounところ 'place', and thesentence ending particleか. The change from
    ところ to どころ is a consistent sound change that is seen regularly in sentences that use所negatively.どころかmay
    be translated as 'far from', 'let alone' or 'anything but'. It strongly negates any statement before
    it, while also emphasizing what comes after it.どころかmay be paired with theattributive formof any other
    word. However, this is not a strict rule, as it can also be seen with the語幹stem form ofな-Adjectives,
    and directly attached to nouns.Sentences that useどころかmust always have a part (B) that emphasizes some
    type of far more important information (in the speaker's opinion).Fun FactAs か simply transforms どころ
    into either a question, or a statement of doubt, the literal translation ofどころかis similar to 'it's
    not even remotely (A)' as a statement, or 'do you honestly think it's (A)!?', when asking a direct
    question.
