  writeup: Occasionally in Japanese, theadverbial particleこそ will be seen followed by therealis form(sometimes
    referred to as the perfective form) of verbs. This is a classical verb form that does not have a modern
    counterpart. However, thehypothetical formhas largely replaced therealis formin the manner in conjugates.The
    verbs that will be seen altered this way are する ‘to do’, なる ‘to become’, and ある ‘to be’. They will
    respectively becomeこそすれ, こそなれ, and こそあれ , and are used specifically for emphasis. Common translations
    include ‘certainly not (B), but (A)’, or ‘even though (B), actually (A)’. The (B) phrase in this grammar
    point will include a negative statement, and is usually something that the speaker is responding to
    or correcting about what another person mistakenly thought.こそすれmay attach to either the noun part
    of する-Verbs, or theconjunctive formof standard verbs.なれ and あれ will be used based on the standard
    rules of what type of word なる would usually appear with (a noun or adjective), and what type of word
    ある would usually appear with (a noun).CautionThere are cases where the base verb will have been entered
    in some way, like by having the causative or the passiveauxiliary verbsattached to them before the
    new base will be altered with こそする. So you will need to work out what verb stem is actually being
    used in any given sentence.
