    "writeup": "In Japanese, のは and のが behave in a very similar way to the words 'that' and 'which' in English. This means that they perform a task called nominalization . Nominalization is when a phrase is treated in the same way as a single noun.Rather than a single noun, we can see from these examples that the phrases 沢山 食 べ る のは and バスに 乗 る のが are behaving in the same way that a single noun would. In English, this can either mean 'that which', or 'the one who/that'.This construction can be used after verbs in any tense, except for the polite ます or ません, which are only used at the end of a sentence, or certain clauses.Cautionの cannot be used as a substitute for こと in set expressions like ことができる , or ことがある . It also may not be followed by だ , である , or です , as this would become the explanatory 〜んです , or のです in that case.",
