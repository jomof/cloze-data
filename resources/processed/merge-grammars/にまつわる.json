    "writeup": "Making use of the う-Verb まつわる 'to coil around',にまつわるis a formal grammar pattern that followsnounsand expresses that something broadly discusses the topic of (A). It is usually translated as 'surrounding (A)', 'associated with (A)', or 'connected to (A)'.In most cases, まつわる will be both preceded and followed by a noun, with the precedingnounbeing the topic, and the followingnounbeing the thing that is dealing with that topic.まつわる itself is primarily seen when (B) is some sort of information or explanation related to (A). Because of this,話'tale',物語'story',伝説'legend',神話'myth', and similar words will often appear as (B).Fun Fact纏わる shares the same kanji as纏まる, another common verb that means 'to come together', or 'to consolidate'. Although the kanji itself is rarely used outside of books, it may help to remember the nuance being conveyed in まつわる of 'coming together'. This 'coming together around (A)', or simply 'surrounding (A)' translates the feeling of the structure quite accurately.",
