  writeup: 好き , meaning 'to like', is one of the very common な-Adjectives in Japanese that is used in
    many different expressions. All な-Adjectives behave similarly to verbs, in that their form changes
    depending on what comes after them.For 好き , it will be followed by な when acting as an adjective,
    or one of either だ or the more polite です when acting as a noun. This distinction is made depending
    on whether it is linked to another noun, or is independent.In the example with だ, 好き is expressing
    that the thing is 'likable' (assertion). However, in the example with な , 好き is expressing 'likability'
    as a quality of the noun it is attached to.Caution好き is considered quite a strong adjective in Japanese
    when it is directed towards people, so it may be interpreted as romantic interest. 大 好き is often translated
    as 'love'.
