  writeup: 癖is anounthat means 'habit' or 'tendency'. However, as it usually refers to a negative thing,
    'vice' is another accurate translation.くせに(usually appearing without kanji) is the combination of
    くせ, and thecase marking particleに. This structure is often used to criticize the actions of others,
    and is used in a similar way to 'despite', 'even though', or 'and yet' in English.As くせ is a noun,くせにmay
    be used after theattributive formof any other word.Fun Fact癖is a word that has developed a 'negative'
    meaning over time. Originally,癖was used to convey a preference, or the side that someone or something
    tended to lean toward (due to it being favorable for some reason). When adding thecase marking particleにto
    this, it merely expressed that (A) was the preferable state/location, so (B) not being/not acting
    in a way appropriate for (A) is less than desirable.
