  writeup: ないでください is an expression that is used to politely ask someone 'not' to do something. It is
    a combination of the casual negative form of a verb, the で particle, and ください (the conjunctive form
    of くださる).ください is classified as honorific language , a type of polite speech that is used to refer
    to the actions of other people. The ください form of くださる is used almost exclusively for making requests.
    くださる is the honorific language equivalent of くれる .In friendly conversation, ください may be omitted from
    this expression, and the で form itself can be used as a very casual way of saying 'please don't do
    (A)'.CautionAlthough ください is the polite form of くれる , ください is considered the base form of this phrase,
    and ないでくれ (the conjunctive form of くれる ) would be considered far too casual in most situations.
