  writeup: ため (or為in its kanji form) is a noun in Japanese that can be translated quite closely to 'sake'
    in English. However, it is classified as anon-independent wordin Japanese, and must always be connected
    to another word which illustrates the 'sake' that ため is highlighting. Thecase marking particleに will
    often be added after ため, to show that (A) is a goal that something will done to reach.However, when
    used with verbs in the past tense,ためにmore frequently highlights that something happened 'due to (A)',
    rather than 'for the sake of (A)'. Because of this, a more accurate description of ため in all situations
    is 'in light of (A)'. This expresses that (A) is the primary or major event/thing that resulted in
    (B).To useためにas 'in light of', 'as a result of', or 'because of', attach it to the end of verb in
    its past form, or a noun follow by の. It may also be used afterい-Adjectivesorな-Adjectivesin theirattributive
    form.This 'in light of (A)' nuance can be used in reference to things that have already happened (as
    above), or in reference to something that is considered as the purpose of an action (as in our otherためにgrammar
    point).
