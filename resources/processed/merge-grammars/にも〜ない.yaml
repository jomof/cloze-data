  writeup: When combined with either of theauxiliary verbsof volition, う or よう,にも〜ないconveys that 'despite
    wanting to (A), it can't be done'. There are usually some circumstances as to why (A) cannot be done
    that are beyond the control of the speaker. The same verb will be repeated in both the volitional
    form and the negated potential form. This means that the literal meaning of this grammar pattern is
    'Even if I went to (A), I can't (A)'. This 'went to' implies the 'attempt' or 'will' on behalf of
    the speaker.CautionAs opposed to the similarに〜ないgrammar point that pairs with verbs indictionary form,ようにも〜ないtends
    to refer more to physical reasons for why something cannot be done.に〜ないon the other hand is often
    used to illustrate mental limitations.
