  writeup: Like ないで 'without',ことなくis an expression used in Japanese following verbs that expresses (B)
    being done 'without (A)'. However;ことなくis used in more formal situations, and when there is some contrast
    between (A) and (B). This may appear in one of two ways, which we will discuss in a moment.ことなくis
    a mix of こと, and なく, the adverbial form of ない. It will follow the dictionary form of verbs.The first
    contrastive use ofことなくillustrates that (A) is something negative, to which (B) should be done as a
    preventative measure, or was able to be done while avoiding (A).The second use ofことなくhighlights when
    (A) is something that was or would be wished for, but unfortunately (B) happened without it being
    realized. In this way, (A) is frequently some kind of unmet desire.
