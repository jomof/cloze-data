  writeup: Much like てはいけない , なくてはいけない states that something 'must not' be done. However, this is where
    the similarities end. なくてはいけない is an example of a double negative in Japanese, and actually has the
    meaning '(A) must be done', or 'must do (A)'.While this grammar point is usually translated as 'must
    do', the literal translation is 'must not, not do (A)'. This double 'not' is where many learners have
    difficulties. いけない simply means 'cannot go', and comes from the negative potential form of 行 く.To
    use this structure, simply create the negative form of a verb, and then convert ない to なく (the conjunctive
    form of an い-Adjective ), followed by て . After this, は is added, and then finally いけない .いけない is considered
    to be the most common structure used with the 'must', and 'must not' grammar points, and is natural
    in both speech, and written Japanese. Alternatively, ならない may be used in formal speech, but is much
    better suited to writing. だめ is also acceptable, but much more casual than either いけない or ならない .CautionThe
    ては in なくては is often converted to ちゃ, as this is easier to say. なくちゃ may then be followed by いけない ,
    or いけない may be omitted, without changing the meaning.These casual structures are very similar to words
    like 'gotta' in English.
