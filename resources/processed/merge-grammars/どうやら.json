    "writeup": "どうやらcan be translated as 'apparently', or 'it seems like', and is often grouped together with other phrases of speculation such as ようだ, そうだ, and らしい. Due to this,どうやらsimply strengthens the uncertainty of things that the speaker is already unsure about. This is in a similar fashion to phrases like 'in some way it seems like (A)'.Like many adverbs that express amount or speculation,どうやらwill appear at the beginning of sentences and modify the meaning of the entire phrase.Fun-fact - While classified as a standalone adverb,どうやらis originally a combination of どう 'how' and やら, a助詞(particle) that is used for denoting uncertainty about singular things or lists. With this in mind, it is similar to the way that 'or whatever', or 'or some such' may be added to a sentence in English in order to emphasize that (A) is not certain.",
