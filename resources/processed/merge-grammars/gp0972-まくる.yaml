  writeup: まくるis a verb that will be attached to theconjunctive formof other verbs in order to show that
    (A) is being done over and over, a lot, or with a great amount of vigor. It comes from the verb う-Verb捲る
    'to roll', or 'to turn', so means 'to do (A) around and again'. Common translations include 'to (A)
    like crazy', 'to do nothing but (A)', and 'to constantly do (A)'.As mentioned, this structure will
    attach to theconjunctive formof other verbs.This structure may be used both in positive or negative
    contexts, and it is quite common for the nuance ofまくるto indicate that (A) is being done recklessly,
    or with abandon. This implies that the speaker isn't thinking about the consequences of doing (A)
    repeatedly, if any may exist.CautionThe (A) verb must be something that is volitional, meaning that
    the speaker must have control over it and its repetition.
