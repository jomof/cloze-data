  writeup: In order to express an objective opinion in Japanese, the expressionと考えられるwill often be used.
    This is a combination of と, and the passive-indicatingauxiliary verbられる. Common translations for this
    structure include 'can be considered as (A)', 'is thought to be (A)', or 'it is conceivable that (A)'.Asと考えられるbegins
    with と, this structure will frequently appear at the end of entire phrases, converting them into a
    quote.When wanting to express a subjective opinion,と思われるwill be used instead.Fun-fact - The primary
    difference between a subjective and objective opinion is that an objective opinion is primarily based
    on observable facts about the topic (unbiased and focuses on the object), while a subjective opinion
    is based more on emotions, feelings, or preferences (may be biased, regardless of what is actually
    true about the topic).Caution - Compared toと考えられている,と考えられるfocuses more on judgements, while the former
    is primarily used to illustrate widely accepted opinions.
