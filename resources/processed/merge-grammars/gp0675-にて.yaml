  writeup: にてis often considered as its own stand-alone particle, despite originally being a mix of に,
    and the conjunction particle, て. When combined,にてbecomes a formal case-marking particle that is used
    in the same way as で. This means that it can convey the meaning of 'with (A)', 'by (A)', 'at (A)',
    or 'using (A)'.にてwill primarily appear following nouns that illustrate a means, method, time, location,
    reason, or origin that the speaker wants to highlight.As this grammar structure is formal, it will
    primarily be seen in writing, or heard in announcements. で will be the far more natural choice in
    casual conversation.
