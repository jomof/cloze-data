  writeup: The sentence-ending particle わ initially stems from the adverbial particle は, however, they
    are used in quite different ways. わ will primarily be used by women to either emphasize something,
    or for the purpose of convincing the person they are talking to that their statement is true.This
    could be translated as 'you know!', 'oh?', 'ever so (A)', or 'oh how I ever (A)' in English, where
    (A) is some fact that they want to highlight.わ may be used after the plain form of words, which means
    any verb, adjective, or auxiliary verb in their unconjugated forms.Note that both だ and です are acceptable.
    This is because both だ and です are different auxiliary verbs that are in their plain form, rather than
    one being a conjugation of the other.Usage of わ by younger women is become less and less common in
    recent generations.Cautionわ may also be used by men. However, this use puts emphasis on either surprise
    or light exasperation. This exasperation is usually in relation to something that is true, but cannot
    be helped.わ used by men for these purposes is still very common in some parts of Japan. Particularly
    the west. Thankfully, there is a very obvious pitch difference between the わ that is used in female
    speech, and the わ that is used in male speech.
