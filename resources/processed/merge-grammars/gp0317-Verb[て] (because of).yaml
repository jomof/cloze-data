  writeup: One of the functions that the conjunction particleてperforms in Japanese is very similar to
    'since', or 'due to', in English. Phrases that use this particular (A)て(B) nuance of theて-formprimarily
    express something that is beyond the control of the speaker in the (B) statement.To use this grammar
    construction, pair theて-formof a verb orい-Adjectivewith the (B) phrase. In the case of nouns andな-Adjectives,で(the
    particle) will be used instead.Fun FactThe 'because' nuance ofて(orで) in this grammar construction
    is primarily influenced by the (B) phrase being something that is uncontrollable, rather than being
    a different meaning of the particlesて, orでthemselves. Literally the meaning is closer to the following:(A)
    て困る - Being troubled cannot be controlled, so (A) must have caused it.(A) て嬉しい - Being happy cannot
    be controlled, so (A) must have caused it.(A) て大変- Having a problem cannot be controlled, so (A) must
    have caused it.(A) て びっくり - Being surprised cannot be controlled, so (A) must have caused it.(A) て疲れている
    - Being worn-out cannot be controlled, so (A) must have caused it.(A) て心配- Feeling anxiety cannot
    be controlled, so (A) must have caused it.Many other words, such as the ones listed above will causeて(orで)
    to have a similar nuance.てすみませんalso uses this meaning ofて, as すみません is a feeling that the speaker
    cannot control, relating to the situation being left unfinished.
