  writeup: じゃない is the casual form of ではない . では is regularly contracted to じゃ in Japanese, so is worth
    remembering as its own structure. じゃない (casual), or ではない (semi-polite) are the structures used for
    creating the negative form of nouns and な-Adjectives .These structures are simply added to the base
    form of the noun or な-Adjective .じゃ and では can also be used with the negative ます form of ある , to create
    the polite variant.ない is sometimes said/written as ね or ねえ . However, this is considered very casual,
    or even a bit rough. Accordingly, it is best avoided in most conversations.Cautionじゃない is used very
    frequently to ask questions. This is similar to じゃないか , a grammar point covered in another lesson.
    However, the nuance difference is that じゃない as a question is a little bit more blunt, like 'isn't
    it?' in English. On the other hand, じゃないか is more like 'don't you think?'.When じゃない is used as a question,
    it will usually be obvious, due to a rising tone.
