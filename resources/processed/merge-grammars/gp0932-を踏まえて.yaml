    taking things into account. Because of this, the combination of theadverbial particleを, and踏まえる in
    its て-form can frequently be translated as 'considering (A)', or 'keeping (A) in mind'.を踏まえてis primarily
    used in formal situations where (B) is an action being undertaken with (A) as the premise. As this

    ofを踏まえてas 'being firmly planted' can be used equally as naturally, so long as its figurative nature
    is kept in mind.
