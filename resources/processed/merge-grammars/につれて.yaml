  writeup: につれて, orに連れてwhen using kanji, is an expression that may be translated as 'as (A), then (B)',
    or 'in proportion to (A), (B)'. It is formed through the use of thecase marking particleに, the る -
    Verb連れる 'to take along', and theconjunction particleて. Literally, the translation is similar to 'being
    taken along with (A), (B)', or 'in tow with (A), (B)'.につれてwill be used after the plain, non-past form
    of verbs, or nouns.As連れる is a transitive verb, (A)につれて(B) implies that (A) is causing (B) to happen
    simultaneously. This does not have to be something that (A) is purposely doing (although it may be),
    just a 'domino' type effect, where (A) is considered the instigator.
