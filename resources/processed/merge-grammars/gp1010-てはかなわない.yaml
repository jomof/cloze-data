  writeup: In order to convey that something is undesirable, the grammar structureてはかなわないmay be used.
    This combines theconjunction particleて, theadverbial particleは, and the negative form of the う-Verb叶う
    ‘to grant (a wish)’, or ‘to realize (a goal)’. This may be interpreted as ‘it’s unbearable when (A)’,
    or ‘I can’t stand it when (A)’. However, the literal translation is ‘it’s not a dream come true for
    (A)’.When used following verbs, the (A) verb is often in the passive. This indicates that the speaker
    does not like being the target or victim of (A). However, standard verb structures may also be seen.In
    addition to this,てはかなわないmay follow theconjunctive formof い-Adjectives, or appear as ではかなわない when following
    な-Adjectives.CautionAlthough many grammar structures frequently appear in hiragana, making their original
    kanji hard to identify, it will be important not to mix up叶う ‘to grant’ with敵う ‘to be a match for’.
    Grammatically, these verbs are both used quite differently.
