  writeup: とあればis a grammar pattern in Japanese that is used as an emphatic version of なら 'if'. It will
    primarily be used in formal situations, or for literary effect, such as in a novel. It may be translated
    as 'if (A) is the case, then (B)', or 'should (A) be true, then (B)'.This is a combination of the
    case-marking particle と, and thehypothetical formof the う-Verb ある 'to be', あれば.とあればwill primarily
    follow nouns, but is occasionally also seen after other structures such as verbs and adjectives when
    the と is being used as aquotation.(A) is often some special circumstance or condition that leads to
    the conclusion or assumption of (B), were (A) to be accurate. As this expression is emphatic, (B)
    will usually indicate something that must be done, or can't be avoided with structures like しかない,
    なければならない, ざるを得ない, etc.Fun Factとあればtends to appear with のため before it quite often. This can be translated
    as 'if for the purpose of (A)', and will describe the lengths that the speaker is willing to go for
    (A) in (B).
