  writeup: ような気がするis a phrase that takes the base meaning of気がする 'to have a feeling that (A)', or 'to
    give off a vibe that (A)', and adds an extra layer of uncertainty through use of theauxiliary verbよう.
    This can be understood as meaning 'to have a funny feeling that (A)', or 'to kinda have a feeling
    that (A)'.As always, よう must be attached to theattributive formof any word that comes before it.Caution気がする
    is quite a bit stronger thanような気がする, so the latter will often be used when the speaker is not 100%
    sure about something, and does not want to sound rude.
