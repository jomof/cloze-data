  writeup: When the る - Verb合わせる (sometimes併せる) is seen in the form合わせて, it conveys that something has
    been made to 'match (A)' or 'fit with (A)'. (A) being a noun that appears beforeに, followed by合わせて.
    This structure can also have the nuance of 'in accordance with (A)', highlighting that (A) is the
    governing factor.It is also possible to see the う - Verb合うused in its past tense form, linking an
    (A) noun to a (B) noun. This has a similar meaning, but is closer to '(B) that has met (A)'.In sentences
    that use either of these expressions, more information is usually given about why something is happening
    in accordance with (A), or what the purpose of (B) meeting (A) is/was.CautionWith合わせて, sometimes the
    meaning is as simple as 'at the same time as (A)', or 'together with (A)'. However, (A) will still
    be perceived as being the primary cause/reason for whatever happens in the (B) part of the sentence.
