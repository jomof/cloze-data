  grammar_point: だけでなく(て)〜も
  jlpt: N3
  meaning: Not only ~ but ~ also, Not just ~ but ~ also
  meaning_warning: なくて = casual・colloquial, なく = formal・written
  details:
    Register: Standard
    使用域: 一般
  writeup: As an extension of the standardだけでなく, meaning 'not only, but also', adding theadverbial particleも
    to the (B) part of a sentence will place extra emphasis on the thing that is being included in the
    same category as (A).だけ itself is anadverbial particle, so will primarily follow nouns. After this,
    the negative conjunctive form of theauxiliary verbだ (でなく) will create the 'not only' meaning.て is
    not strictly required as part of this structure, but will help to create a far more natural 'separation'
    between (A) and (B) when it is used.Either じゃなく orじゃなくてmay also be used, as is the case with all でなく
    andではなくbased grammar structures.
