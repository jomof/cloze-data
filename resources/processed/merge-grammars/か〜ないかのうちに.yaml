  writeup: か〜ないかのうちにis a slightly formal grammar structure used in Japanese to indicate a precise point
    in time where the action of (A) can not be determined as either being started, or finished. Usually,
    it highlights the exact moment either before or after (A) commences. This grammar structure is comprised
    of か, ない, か, の, the noun内'within', and に. Literally, it just means 'while not knowing whether (A)
    or not (A), (B)'.The verb that appears before か and ないか must be repeated in this grammar pattern,
    and may be used in its dictionary form. Standard translations include 'right after (A)', 'as soon
    as (A)', and 'barely when (A)'.Additionally,か〜ないかのうちにmay be used to highlight relatively short periods
    of time within which something happens. This is usually in regard to some sort of positive or negative
    occurrence that would not usually be expected to be able to happen so quickly.
