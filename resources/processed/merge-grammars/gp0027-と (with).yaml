  writeup: In our second lesson about と , we will look at the common translation of 'with' that is associated
    with this particle. と shows that there is a relationship between (A) and (B), regardless of if that
    relationship is translated as ' and ', or ' with '.In either case, the nouns that are marked with
    と are usually all performing some mutual action (that mutual action may simply be existing).When と
    is used as 'with', it means that both/all people or objects are equally involved in the action. However,
    に highlights that one person is the target (destination) of an action, so will result in something
    sounding a lot more one sided.Here we can see that both people are talking when と is used. It is a
    mutual conversation. When に is used, however, the person marked by に is being talked 'to', and is
    usually not actively participating in the conversation.
  examples:
    - japanese: トムと話す。
      english: I talk with Tom.
    - japanese: 僕は友達とごはんを食べる。
      english: I will eat food with my friend.
    - japanese: ゆうこさんはみおさんとコーヒーを飲む。
      english: Yuko-san drinks coffee with Mio-san.
    - japanese: タキはミツハと走る。
      english: Taki runs with Mitsuha.
    - japanese: たなかさんはやまださんと話す。
      english: Tanaka-san talks with Yamada-san.

  writeup: '## 1. When Y is the subject of a clause, X to indicates that X and Y have a reciprocal relationship.
    For example, in Example (a), the fact that Tom often plays tennis with John necessarily means that
    John often plays tennis with Tom; in other words, it means that they have a reciprocal relationship.
    Thus, と often corresponds to the English ''with'', as in ''in the company of''. と also appears with
    such reciprocal verbs and adjectives as 結婚する ''marry'', 喧嘩する ''quarrel'', 話し合う ''discuss with'', 似る
    ''resemble'', 違う ''differ'' and 同じだ ''be the same''. (See Examples (b), (c) and (d).)'
