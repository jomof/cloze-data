  writeup: ようにいうis an expression which combines theauxiliary verbようだ, with theう-Verb言う. This indicates
    that something is being said in a way that instigates (A). Asようだis being linked to the verb言う, it
    will take on its adverbial form,ように.Asようにいうmeans 'to be said in the way of (A) being done', it is
    regularly translated as 'to tell', 'to request', or 'to order'. In the case of requesting,頼む may substitute
    for言う. For ordering,命じる may substitute for it instead.言う itself is the most versatile of these three
    verbs, as it may imply 'to order', or 'to request'. This will depend on the tone of the speaker/overall
    context of the request/order.
