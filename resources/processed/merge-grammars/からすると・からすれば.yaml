  writeup: からするとis an expression combining the conjunction particle から 'from', する 'to do', and either
    of the hypothetical markers と or ば. It may be translated as 'judging from (A), (B)', or 'considering
    (A), (B)'. However, the way that する behaves in these types of sentences is quite comparable to expressions
    like 'going off' in English, in that it just indicates that (A) is the basis from which the speaker
    is about to make their judgment.からするとorからすればwill be seen following nouns, before the (B) part of the
    sentence will highlight the speaker's assessment of (A).Fun-fact - In almost all cases that する is
    paired with a hypothetical structure like と, ば, or たら, it indicates that the speaker is 'going with'
    the assumption of (A) being true, before further expressing what applies based on that assumption.
