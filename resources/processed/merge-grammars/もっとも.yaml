  writeup: もっとも, sometimes also seen as尤も, is aconjunctionthat is used to clarify when (A) is not the
    only important thing to be considered. This expression is usually translated as 'although'. However,
    'for all that', or 'with that said' are also accurate translations, depending on the context. Let's
    look at a few examples.Due toもっともoffering clarification about something, the (B) phrase will often
    end with が, けど,けれども, and other similar expressions.Whenもっともis used, the speaker is agreeing that (A)
    is true, but not the whole picture. As a noun itself,尤も can be described as 道理に適う, which means 'to
    stand to reason'. This nuance is kept, and may also be used as an accurate translation forもっともas a
    conjunction.
