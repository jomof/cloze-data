  writeup: One of the uses of the extremely commonというstructure in Japanese is the pairing of identicalnounsin
    order to convey the meaning of 'every single (A)'. In many cases, this expression will simply be used
    for emphasis, but the literal meaning is 'every (B) that could be called an (A)'.というwill be used between
    the samenounrepeating itself.CautionWhen this structure is seen with abstract expressions like今日'today',
    it will generally mean '(A) of all (A)'s'. This just implies that 'of anything that can be called
    (A), this particular one has something special about it'. What that special thing is will usually
    follow immediately after in the sentence.
