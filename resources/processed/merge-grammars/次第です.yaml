  writeup: When following a verb in one of itsstandard forms,次第'directly following' will be used to express
    reasons or give explanations. In these cases, it will be followed by either of theauxiliary verbsだ,
    or です. However, です is far more common, due to this use of次第primarily appearing inpolite speech.In
    this particular use of次第, it is similar to 'the eventuation is that (A)', meaning that something ultimately
    ended up as (A),Fun FactIn all of its nuances,次第just expresses a sequence of events or deciding factors,
    and what either will or has happened due to that. This link can be seen in other grammar patterns
