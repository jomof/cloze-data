  writeup: 折角(せっかく) is an idiomaticadverbthat is often used to express doing something 'with trouble',
    'at great pains', or 'to be a rare/long-awaited occasion'. Being an adverb that often modifies the
    meaning of a whole sentence, it will commonly appear at the beginning of a statement. When折角is nominating
    an event as being long awaited, it will appear directly before the event, separated only by thecase
    marking particleの.Fun FactThere are several guesses for where折角originates. One of the most common
    is that it is an abbreviation for頭巾の角を折る 'to fold the horn (tail) of a hood'. This was something that
    a famous confucian did intentionally to protect his hood from getting wet in the rain. The people
    of the time started to copy the act, and折角also came to be used as an idiom to mean 'intentionally',
    or 'to go out of one's way to do something'.
