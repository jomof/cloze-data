  writeup: どうせis anadverbused in Japanese to express that some particular state or condition of (A) will
    result in (B). Usually, there is no way to stop (B) from happening, and it is considered a natural
    consequence of (A). In English, this translates closely with phrases like 'at any rate', or 'in any
    case'.Being an adverb,どうせmost often appears at the beginning of sentences, before going on to describe
    the inevitable situation.どうせoften carries the nuance of frustration or resignation that (A) cannot
    be changed. In these cases, it is often paired with other grammar structures such as なら or だから. This
    shows that if (A) cannot be changed, then (B) is a good idea. This usage translates similarly to 'if
    (A), you might as well (B)'.Fun-fact - This grammar structure comes from a combination of どう 'how',
    and theimperative formof する, せよ. In this way, it is just emphasizing that no matter 'how (A) is done',
    the result cannot be changed.
