  writeup: きっかけ'chance', or切っ掛け in its kanji form is a noun in Japanese that expresses when the trigger
    of (A) led to (B). It is often translated simply as 'because of (A), (B)', 'with (A) as a trigger,
    (B)', or 'with the opportunity of (A), (B)'.きっかけprimarily appears in two different forms. (A)をきっかけに(B),
    or (A)がきっかけで(B). This grammar pattern may be seen either with verbs in their past-tense form or nouns.
    However, in the case of appearing after verbs, it will often be preceded by の or some other nominalizing
    structure like こと.In many cases, the trigger of (A) will have the effect of instigating a rather large
    change or new beginning.Caution -きっかけwill not be used when the causal relationship between (A) and
    (B) is plainly obvious, due to what would be expected or easy to anticipate result.Because of this,
    it can be thought thatきっかけis almost always referring to the opportunity of (B) appearing because of
    (A), with some external choice being made, or action being taken on that occasion.
