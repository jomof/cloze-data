  writeup: Similarly to だ , です is an auxiliary verb that is an expression of determination or assertion.
    It states that something 'is' a certain way. です is considered to be the polite variation of だ . Keep
    in mind though that although their roles are similar, both だ and です are standalone structures.です connects
    to words in exactly the same way as だ , but is also regularly seen attached to the end of い-Adjectives
    .CautionAlthough です is regularly attached to the end of い-Adjectives , some may actually consider
    this incorrect Japanese, and it should not be used in formal writing. In daily spoken language/texting,
    however, it is completely normal.The above example technically should not be used in formal writing.
    Despite this, in recent years, it is starting to become the norm.
