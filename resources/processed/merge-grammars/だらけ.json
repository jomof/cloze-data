    "writeup": "だらけis asuffixthat is used in Japanese to express when one thing is 'covered in', or 'filled with' another thing.だらけwill be attached to the end of nouns, before (sometimes) being followed by thecase marking particleの and a second noun. The second noun is frequently omitted if the place or thing that is 'covered in' something is obvious.Fun Factだらけis primarily used to express things that exist in a 'scattered' state (like stars in the sky). Due to this, it will not sound natural when used to describe a thing that is 'covered in' something that is not scattered in some way.",
