  writeup: ばよかったis a common expression used when someone regrets that something has not been/was not done.
    It is a pairing of theconjunction particleば, and the past form of theい-Adjective,良い(remembering that
    conjugations ofいいuse よ, and not い). This construction is often translated to 'I wish I did (A)', or
    'I should have done (A)'.ばよかったis used after verbs, so requires the standardばconjugation, before addingよかった.Asばhighlights
    hypothetical situations,ばよかったliterally means that 'it would have been good if (A)', where (A) is the
    thing that the speaker wishes had happened.Fun FactThis grammar point is in direct contrast toばいい,
    the non-past version, which is used to express 'it would be good if (A)'.
