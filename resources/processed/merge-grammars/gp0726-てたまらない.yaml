  writeup: てたまらないis made up of the conjunction particle て, and the negated form of the う-Verb堪る meaning
    'to bear', 'to endure', or 'to tolerate'. Common translations include 'to not be able to help wanting
    to (A)', or 'extremely (A)'.The primary difference between both meanings is that the 'can't help but
    want to (A)' nuance is seen attached to verbs conjugated with たい, while the 'extremely (A)' nuance
    is seen conjugated with both い and な-Adjectives. In both of these situations, the more literal interpretation
    is 'to be unbearably (A)'.As always, で will replace て when な-Adjectives are used.
