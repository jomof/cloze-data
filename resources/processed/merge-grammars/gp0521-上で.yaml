  writeup: 上でis an expression in Japanese that is used after the past form of verbs, or nouns followed
    by の. It shows that something will happen 'after (A)', or 'upon (A)'. This grammar point is used in
    a similar way to its literal meaning, which is 'with the above/previous (A), (B)'.上as 'above', andでas
    'with', in で's use as acase marking particle.上でis a structure that is primarily used in formal settings.
    Due to this, it will not be used in casual conversations very often. It also strongly hints at (A)
    being a requirement for (B), or (A) being something that would logically be expected before (B).CautionDue
    to上でbeing used to show logical progressions from (A) to (B), (A) cannot be a verb that is passive.
    Passivity in Japanese often implies that someone/thing has a lack of control in relation to the actions
    that happen to them/it. As a result of this, (A) not being able to be controlled would result in (B)
    sounding like it could not be planned for.This is different to the way that passivity works in English
    (simply showing that something received an action upon it).
