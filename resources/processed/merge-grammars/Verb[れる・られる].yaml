  writeup: In Japanese, there are several ways to express that something 'passively' happens. All of these
    are done with theauxiliary verbsれるandられる. Japanese verbs in thepassiveform behave in a slightly different
    way than they do in English, so we will examine this difference more closely later. For now, let's
    focus onれる,られる, and される(the form used withするverbs).Passivity in Japanese means that the person (or
    thing) that is the target of the action will be the subject of the sentence, rather than the person
    that is 'doing' whatever verb is being used.You can conjugate any Japanese verb into thepassiveform
    in the following way. Forう-Verbs(godan verbs), simply replace the last kana with the equivalent あ
    sound kana from the same row (す becomes さ, つ becomes た, ぶ becomes ば, う becomes わ, like with ない, and
    so on), then addれる, orられる. Forる-Verbs(ichidan verbs), just replace the る withられる.するandくるbehave slightly
    differently than most other verbs. Forする, it will become される, whileくるwill become こられる.As can be seen
    in these examples, the 'doer' of the verb will be marked withに, butからcan also be used in cases where
    there is no physical contact with the subject.Cautionられるcan be used in several different situations.
    These are listed below.Passive:受け身- Something happens to the subject as a result of an external force
    (sometimes sounds negative).Possible:可能- There is the possibility for something to be done.Spontaneous:自発-
    Something happens by itself, or 'without instigation'.Respectful:尊敬- You are respecting someone by
    making them the subject of the sentence, despite someone else actually performing the verb.Fun FactIn
    Japanese, passivity focuses on the lack of control of the subject of the sentence. Due to this, the
    subject will sometimes be called the なる人, while the doer of the verb is called theする人.Traditionally,
    many textbooks use the term 'passive', simply because there is no equivalent verb type in English
    (passiveis the closest). However, we would like to introduce the term 'displacement verb'. This just
    means that the subject of the sentence is being described in a similar way to what happens in keigo
    (polite speech).CautionBut wait, what aboutれるwithる-Verbs! Well, in Japanese, ら removal words 'ラ抜き言葉'
    are very common. These are words that are able to useれる, instead ofられる. The original meaning of both
    of theseauxiliary verbsis exactly the same, but there are cases where ら may not be removed. The standard
    rules are as follows.ら may be removed -る-Verbsandくる, when the meaning is 'possible'.ら may not be removed
    -る-Verbsandくる, when the meaning is 'passive', 'spontaneous', or 'respectful'.In both of these sentences,
    the meaning is exactly the same. However, ラ抜き may only be used whenられるis being used to highlight 'possibility'.
