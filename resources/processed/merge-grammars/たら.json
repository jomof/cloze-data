    "writeup": "Theconjunction particleたらis used as a kind of 'halfway point' between 'if' and 'when' in Japanese. It expresses the completion of an (A) action, and then a (B) action that is considered to be the result of (A). It may be hypothetical, or it may be presenting a one-time result of something that happened in the past.To useたら, it will replace た in the simple past form of verbs,い-Adjectives,な-Adjectives, and nouns.CautionDespite appearing to be the past form of the word that it is attached to,たらitself does not actually carry the nuance of 'past'. Other words in the sentence will need to be examined to see whetherたらis truly highlighting something from the past, or simply the completion of something (which may or may not happen in the future).Fun FactAlthoughたらis regularly used to mean 'if', it almost always has a nuance of 'when'. This is due toたらspecifically highlighting the following situations:Completion:完了- Completion of (A).Materialization:成立- Coming to fruition of (A).These meanings are opposed to other 'if' structures likeば, andなら, which focus far more strongly on the hypothetical 'if' meaning.",

    "writeup": "## 1. The meaning of Sentence1たらSentence2 varies depending on the contents of Sentence1 and Sentence2 and also on the situation in which this construction is used. However, Sentence always represents an antecedent and Sentence2 a subsequence. For example, in Key Sentence, Mr. Yamada's coming precedes the speaker's returning home. Likewise, in Example (a), the speaker's asking his teacher precedes his understanding something. If this relation does not hold, this construction cannot be used. For example, (1) cannot be expressed by the たら construction because the event of Sentence1, the speaker's going to Chicago, does not precede the event of Sentence2, his going there by car.\n\n- ⎧a. 来なさい。\n- ⎪b. 来てください。\n- 仕事が早く終わっらた僕のうちに\n- ⎨c. 来たらどうですか。\n- ⎩d. 来ませんか。",
