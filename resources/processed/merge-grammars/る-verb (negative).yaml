  writeup: The negative form of る-Verbs are conjugated based on the same set of rules used for other forms
    of る-Verb conjugation (removal of る, followed by the addition of something else). In the case of negation,
    the additional component will be ない (casual), or ません (polite).While the common translation of ない and
    ません is simply 'not', they actually have several possible nuances. These nuances are 'don't' (usually
    not), 'won't' (intentionally not), or 'can't' (unintentionally not).Both ない and ません are auxiliary
    verbs ( ません is a conjugation of ます), meaning that they have their own set of conjugation rules.CautionThe
    ない attached to make the negative form of adjectives is a different word, and therefore follows different
    conjugation rules. When attached to adjectives ない itself is an い-Adjective , and not an auxiliary
    verb .
