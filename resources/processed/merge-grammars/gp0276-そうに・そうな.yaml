  writeup: そうだis one of the 18auxiliary verbsin Japanese, and can be used in the same way asな-Adjectives(may
    be followed by な when acting as an adjective, or に when acting as an adverb). This is a unique characteristic
    ofそうだandようだ. It is not something that can be done with allauxiliary verbs. As withそうだ,そうにandそうなcarry
    the meaning of 'seeming like (A)', or 'looking like (A)'.Cautionそうmay also be used when attached to
    theい-Adjective, ない. In this case, there is a unique conjugation rule which you will need to be careful
    of. As always, い will be removed from ない before attachingそう. However, さ will need to be inserted between
    な, andそう. This results in the construction なさそう.Note that this addition of さ does not happen with
    verbs. This is due to the ない that is used with negative verbs being anauxiliary verb,  and not anい-Adjective.
    With theauxiliary verbない, simply remove the い, before addingそうdirectly to the stem.
