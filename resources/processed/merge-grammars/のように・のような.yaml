  writeup: Theauxiliary verbようだis used for making observations. It states that something is 'in the manner/way
    of (A)'. Like theauxiliary verbそうだ,ようだmay be used in a similar way toな-Adjectives(can be followed
    by な when acting as an adjective, orにwhen acting as an adverb).のis required before these constructions
    when it is describing a noun.Becauseよう(coming from the kanji様) usually expresses the 'manner' in which
    something is existing/happening, it is regularly used when the speaker has direct personal experience
    from which they are drawing a comparison. This means thatようwill sound far more confident thanみたい,
    orそう.Fun FactWhenようだis describing another word (in itsような, orようにform), this is known as 'presenting
    an example' (例示in Japanese), and means that '(A) is an example of (B)'.
