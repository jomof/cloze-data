  writeup: にする is a structure that combines the に particle (a location/target), with the verb する . It
    means to 'make/decide' something in a certain way. The nuance with にする is that the speaker has direct
    control over the outcome. This is where the strong feeling of 'choice' comes from. The noun that comes
    before にする is the thing that is being decided.In this example, although the common translation is
    'to decide', it is actually much closer to the slang expression 'to do (A)' in English. This means
    that the literal translation is actually 'I'll do a beer', or 'I'll make it a beer'.Sometimes the
    particle と is used instead of に. Although this has the same meaning, it changes the nuance slightly.
    When と is used, it takes away the feeling of being a direct decision. とする tends to be used in more
    formal situations, but this is only because と is less 'definite', so results in the phrase sounding
    less pushy.If you were going to compare these two to an English equivalent, it would be similar to
    the difference between the following sentences.に - I'll buy a burger. (A burger is the direct target
    of 'buy')と - I'll go with a burger. (You aren't 'going' anywhere, it just sounds softer)This grammar
    point may be used for more abstract nouns, and does not specifically need to be 'items'.
