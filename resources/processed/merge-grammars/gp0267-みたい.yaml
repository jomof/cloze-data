  writeup: In Japanese, there are many ways to express that something happens in a way that is 'like'
    something else, or 'resembles' something else. One of these ways is through the use of theな-Adjective,みたい.みたいcan
    be used after any word that aな-Adjectivewould usually follow, to express that something is 'like (A)',
    or 'similar to (A)'.In the above examples, we can see thatみたいshould always be followed byだ(orです) when
    it is at the end of a statement, however, this is frequently omitted.みたいis also often used to describe
    another noun, but needs to be followed by な in these cases. In this type of sentence, it is just expressing
    that something is '(B), but resembles (A)'.みたいis used most often in conversational situations, and
    is based on direct, reliable information. It is far less formal than its counterpart,ようだ.CautionDespiteみたいmeaning
    'to resemble', and being based on (usually) visual stimulus, it should not be confused with見たい 'to
    want to see'. This is a common mistake that learners make, asみたいitself does not have a kanji form.Fun
    Factみたいだis originally an abbreviation of the more formal phrase を見たような. As a result of this, we can
    see thatようだkept its formal meaning, whileみたいbecame the casual equivalent.
