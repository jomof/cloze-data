  writeup: Like many other adverbs in Japanese,まずcan be used to modify a whole phrase/sentence. This means
    that it will regularly appear at the beginning of a statement.まずis associated with kanji先and therefore
    carries the meaning of 'first', or 'starting with'.まずis regularly used when you want to convey that
    something 'should' be done before anything else/discussed first, and not when something is first in
    rank.In this kind of sentence, it would be far more natural to use a statement like一番,最初or一位if discussing
    rank.CautionWhen usingまず, it can sound like you are giving someone advice, so be careful to use polite
    language, or perhapsと思うto show that the suggestion is just an opinion.
