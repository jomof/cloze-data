    "writeup": "さ is a感動詞(interjection) in Japanese that has three primary uses. These are as follows:誘い、促し - To invite, incite, or draw attention to something.驚き、当惑し - To express surprise, confusion, or bewilderment.話の流れを抑える - To control or keep in check the flow of a conversation.In this lesson, we will be focusing on the first meaning (to invite or draw attention). In English, this is usually translated as 'there we go', 'ok then', or 'well you see'. さ (or sometimes さあ) will come at the beginning of a sentence, before the point that the speaker would like to highlight is explained.CautionThisさand theさused for expressing confusion or bewilderment are often used interchangeably. When drawing attention, it comes across like 'well you see', but when expressing confusion, it is closer to 'well let me see'. The latter has a slight nuance of 'let me think about my answer first'.",
