  writeup: とは言うもののis a set expression that may be used after most types of words, it is a combination
    of と as a case-marking particle, は as anadverbial particle, the う-Verb言う, and theconjunction particleものの
    'although'. Its literal translation of 'although it is said that (A), (B)' is the same as how it will
    usually be interpreted in English.When used after either nouns or な-Adjectives, だ will precedeとは言うものの.This
    phrase may also be used at the beginning of sentences when acknowledging a statement that was made,
    but then pointing out that there is other important information as well. In all cases, the (B) phrase
    that comes after ものの will be considered the important or defining detail.
