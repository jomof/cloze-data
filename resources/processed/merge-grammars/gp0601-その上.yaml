  writeup: その上is a formal expression used in Japanese to indicate that something is 'besides', 'in addition
    to', or 'furthermore' in relation to the previous statement. It primarily comes at the beginning of
    sentences before reflecting back on and adding new information in regard to what has already been
    said.The literal meaning can be thought of as 'on top of that (B)', where 'that' is the information
    that has already been mentioned.Despite often being used in formal settings, it is not uncommon to
    hear this phrase used in daily speech, due to its simplicity in highlighting something being 'in addition'.
