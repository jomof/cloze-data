    "writeup": "In the previous grammar point, we learned thatたところ(orていたところ) will mean 'just did (A)', or 'was just doing (A)'.ているところworks in a similar way, but expresses that someone is right in the middle of doing something. It is regularly translated as 'doing (A) right now', or 'in the process of (A)'.CautionUsingているところwill indicate that someone is 'busy with (A)', and would therefore not be used when changing actions suddenly. In these casesているところだったwould be used, before the (B) phrase would further explain what happened next.",
