  writeup: In Japanese, て is a very important conjunction particle that can be used with many different
    structures. When it is partnered with a verb, it has special conjugation rules, depending on whether
    it is being added to a る-Verb or a う-Verb . In the case of う-Verbs , it also depends on what the preceding
    kana is.The most common translation in any situation is just 'and' or 'then', due to (B) being highlighted
    as something that happens/happened after (A).In these examples, we can see that て basically means
    '(A) て (B)' = '(A) happened, then (B)'. However, this is only when it is linked to another verb.Sometimes
    the て form appears as で . This is a change that happened throughout the course of history, in order
    to make sentences flow more smoothly. Despite this, there is no difference in meaning between て and
    で as a vocal change.The easiest way to identify whether to use て or で is by looking at the preceding
    kana. If the plain (dictionary) form of the verb finishes in ぐ, ぬ, ぶ, or む, then で will be used. る-Verbs
    never use で .CautionThere are several irregular verbs when it comes to て form conjugation. Let's look
    at an example of each one.Apart from these 5 verbs, the rules for て form conjugation are 100% consistent.
