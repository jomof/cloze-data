  writeup: はともかくis an expression which makes use of the adverbial-particle は, and the adverb兎も角meaning
    'to set aside', or 'at any rate'. This structure will be used when the speaker wants to change the
    topic from (A) to (B), or mention (B) as being something additional on top of (A).はともかくis primarily
    seen following nouns in their dictionary forms. In many cases, this will be when (A) is something
    that the speaker thinks is not worth considering, or not worth making an issue out of when (B) is
    more important.Fun-fact - The adverb兎も角is thought to have come from the Buddhist expression兎角亀毛, meaning
    'horns on rabbits, fur on turtles', referring to things that do not exist. Although this particular
    meaning is not widely accepted as being strongly related to the modern meaning of兎も角, some relation
    can be drawn between it and English phrases such as '(A) is neither here nor there' in reference to
    something that is non-existent, or of little importance.
