  writeup: も can mean 'too/also', or 'even', or 'neither/either', depending on if the sentence is affirmative
    or negative. Multiple meanings like this are quite common for Japanese particles, as there is no need
    to use different words simply to agree with other statements in the sentence (unlike English).As you
    can see here, English requires 'either/neither (when negative)', or 'too/also', but Japanese only
    requires も . You can think of it as simply meaning 'Whatever is true for (A), is also true for (B)'.も
    is part of many other compound grammar structures in which it keeps its original meaning, but shifts
    the nuance a little bit. Some of these include でも , にも〜ない , とも . As we can see, it is frequently paired
    with other particles!Here, も can be seen pairing with で . This suggests that 'With (A), (B) also'.
    This is regularly translated simply as 'but' in English, despite the nuance being closer to 'and also'.

    - japanese: あなたもトムです。

    - japanese: 私も。
