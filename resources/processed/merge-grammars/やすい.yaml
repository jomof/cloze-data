  writeup: 易い is an い-Adjective that is regularly seen attached to the ます stem of verbs (the form of a
    verb that can be used as a noun). When attached in this way, it carries the meaning of 'easy to (A)',
    where (A) is the verb that comes before やすい .Sometimes, やすい has a translation that is a bit closer
    to 'prone to (A)', or 'likely to (A)' in English. This nuance is regularly seen when the verb is related
    to emotions.CautionThere is another adjective 安 い that has the meaning of 'cheap'. This kanji should
    never be used with verbs to mean 'easy'. Most of the time, やすい itself will be written in hiragana,
    and usage of 易い is quite limited.Fun FactAlthough 易い is an い-Adjective , it is almost never used by
    itself (when not attached to verbs). In such cases, it is much more natural to use the な-Adjective
    簡単 .
  examples:
    - japanese: 昨日やすいゲームを買った。
      english: The game that I bought yesterday was cheap. (安い meaning cheap, not 易い meaning easy)
    - japanese: 私は簡単なゲームが好きです。
      english: I enjoy easy games. (易い would not work here, as it is not usually used without a verb)
    - japanese: ケーキは作りやすい。
      english: Cake is easy to make.
    - japanese: 東京から大阪へは電車が行きやすいですよ。
      english: It is easy to go from Tokyo to Osaka by train!
    - japanese: 今日の宿題は少なかったので、しやすかった。
