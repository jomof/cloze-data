  writeup: Although a combination of thesubstitute noun何and the imperative form of する, しろ,何しろis often
    considered to be a singular adverb that carries the meaning of 'no wonder', or 'after all'. A more
    literal translation would be something like 'whatever the case, (A)', and just expresses that in any
    circumstance, only one conclusion can accurately be drawn in regard to (A).何しろwill frequently appear
    at the beginning of a sentence, or at the start of the second clause.何しろwill regularly be seen partnered
    with statements including words like から or ので, in order to emphasize an explanation or reason as to
    why (A) is the way it is.
