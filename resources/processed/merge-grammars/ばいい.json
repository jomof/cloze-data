    "writeup": "In contrast toばよかった, which is used for expressing regret about something that someone wishes had been done,ばいいhighlights that the speaker is hoping for a particular result, in relation to something that has not happened yet. This translates as 'It'd be good if (A)'.To use ばいい, add theconjunction particleば, to the end of any verb, and then attach theい-Adjective,いい.Althoughばいいliterally means 'if (A), it's good', it can also be used to give advice, and has a meaning that is similar to 'should (A)' in these situations. It is generally quite a soft way of giving advice.Cautionばいいmay also be used when making statements about something that the speaker believes is not possible. In these cases, it is regularly paired withのに, and has the nuance of 'despite it being good if it were (A)'. This shows that the speaker thinks that (A) would be good, but is aware that (A) cannot/will not happen for some reason.",
