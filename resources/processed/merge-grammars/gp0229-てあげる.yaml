  writeup: When joining theconjunction particleて, with theる-Verbあげる(to give), it implies that someone
    is doing something for the benefit of someone else. Literally, this expression means 'to give/bestow
    the action of (A) upon (B)', but translates more naturally as 'to do (A) for (B)', or 'to do (A) as
    a favor for (B)'.The receiver of theてあげるaction will be marked withに, while the doer will be marked
    withが(if mentioned).CautionUnfortunately,てあげるcan sound quite patronizing in modern Japanese, and should
    be avoided in situations where someone may take offence to having something done for them (for example,
    doing something for someone of higher status). This is primarily due toやる(a casual variation of 'to
    give') being phased out.Fun FactOriginally,やるwas used when referring to giving water to plants, or
    feeding animals. However, some people started usingあげるfor these purposes as well, believing that it
    sounded 'nicer'. Historically, this actually achieved the opposite result, and some people began to
    think thatあげるwas insulting, as it was being used for plants/animals.These days,てやるis almost never
    used, unless you have a very close relationship with someone and are using it jokingly.

  writeup: '## 1. あげる is used as an auxiliary verb with the て form of verbs. The meaning of Verb-てあげる
    is ''do something for someone'' or ''do someone a favour by doing something''. The restriction which
    applies to あげる1 also applies to あげる2. Namely, sentences with Verb-てあげる are descriptions from the viewpoint
    of the benefactor (i.e., the person in subject position); therefore, the indirect object must not
    be the first person or a person the speaker empathizes with. (⇨ ㊦ あげる (1)1, Note 1) Thus, (1a) and
    (1b) are ungrammatical.'
  formation: "## \n\n- Vて\n- あげる\n- 話してあげる\n- talk for someone’s sake\n- 食べてあげる\n- eat for someone’s sake"
  part_of_speech: Auxiliary Verb (Group 2)
