  writeup: ぬis the attributive form of ず, aclassical auxiliary verbthat is used for negation like ない,
    and connects to verbs in the same way.Asぬis the attributive form of ず, it may be seen modifying nouns
    that directly follow it. However, this use is not common in modern times, and in many cases it will
    be used as part of set expressions that have not changed in the time since ない became the far more
    widely used structure for negation. Alternatively, it may just be used for artistic expression, or
    to make a character seem 'classical'.In the case that the verb being negated is いる, the old fashion
    おる will be modified toおらぬinstead.Alternatively, する will be negated asせぬ, and くる will be negated asこぬ.
    This is consistent with the standard conjugation patterns seen with the use of ず.
