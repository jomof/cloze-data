  writeup: ことだし is a combination of thenounこと 'thing', theauxiliary verbだ, and theconjunction particleし,
    used for listing reasons. The whole structure itself often translates simply as 'because (A)', or
    'since (A)', but places extra emphasis on there being other reasons besides what the speaker has specified.This
    structure may appear after any word in itsattributive form, or after anounthat has been followed with
    の.Just like with its standard use in creating lists, し is being used in this grammar point to show
    that (A) is not exclusive. The way this comes across is that 'while there are other reasons, (A) is
    good enough to (B)'. (B) is usually some suggestion, invitation, or expression of determination.
