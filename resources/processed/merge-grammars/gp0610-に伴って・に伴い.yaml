  writeup: When the う-Verb伴う 'to accompany' in its て-form is used with に and attached to the end of nouns
    or verbs in their dictionary forms, it is regularly translated as 'due to (A), (B)', 'hand in hand
    with (A), (B)', or 'along with (A), (B)'. In all of these meanings, the base interpretation of 'to
    accompany' is being highlighted.As 'accompanying' does not specifically indicate that (A) is controlling
    (B), this grammar structure may be used simply to indicate things that happen at the same time, rather
    than when something is being directly caused by the first. However, (A) having a strong influence
    on the change of (B) is usually implied.に伴うmay also appear directly before another noun when it is
    being modified by the verb.に伴ってis used both for events that are progressively changing at the same
    time, and momentary events that cause a sudden change.
