  writeup: お〜になる(orご〜になる) is anhonorific languageexpression which is used to pay respect to the actions
    of the person that is being spoken to/another person (never the speaker). In this expression,になるis
    used in exactly the same way thatするwould be, except that it will be attached to the ます stem of the
    verb that it is referring to.The primary difference between お and ご, is that お will be used with words/readings
    of Japanese origin (kun-yomi), and ご will be used with words/readings of Chinese origin (on-yomi).
    In fact, お and ご are both represented by the same kanji. For this kanji,御is one of the kun-yomi, and御is
    one of the on-yomi.Fun FactSome verbs, like いでる, are used almost exclusively withhonorific language.
    おいでになる (theお〜になるform of いでる) is an example of this, and can mean 'to come', 'to go', or 'to be'. This
    is due to the perspective of the speaker when usinghonorific language, and something that we will
    discuss in more detail later.

  writeup: '## 1. In ordinary circumstances, おVerbますになる is used when the speaker describes someone''s
    action or state with respect. However, if a social norm requires the speaker to talk in honorific
    speech, the honorific form is used, even if the speaker does not respect the person he talks about.
    Politeness is expressed in this form by two elements: first by the polite prefix お, and second by
    the verb なる which describes someone''s action or state indirectly. This indirectness is a common strategy
    in polite expressions.'
  formation: "## \n\n- おVます\n- になる\n- お話しになる\n- Someone (will) talk\n- お教えになる\n- Someone (will) teach"
