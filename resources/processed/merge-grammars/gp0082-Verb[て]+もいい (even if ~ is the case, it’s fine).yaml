  writeup: Noun, い-Adjective , or な-Adjective+てもいい is a construction in Japanese that is used to express
    that something is 'okay', or 'alright'. It is also frequently used as a question to ask if you 'can',
    or 'may' do something.As can be seen, with い-Adjectives , we will need to use the conjugation form.
    This is created by removing the い and then replacing it with く.This phrase is also regularly used
    without the も , but is considered a bit more direct/casual in those cases. It is best to remove the
    も only when talking to people that you know well.てもいい is an expression that literally means て (noun,
    etc) も (also) いい (is good).Similarly to the てもいい grammar point that is used with verbs, this variant
    may also be used as a question. To do this, you simply need to follow てもいい with です か , or the more
    casual の .
