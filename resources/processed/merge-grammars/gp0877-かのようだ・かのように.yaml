  writeup: かのようだis a set phrase in Japanese indicating that something 'appears to be (A)', but the speaker
    is not certain. It will be translated as 'as if (A)', or 'just like (A)'. This is a combination of
    theadverbial particleか, の and theauxiliary verb様だ 'appearing to be'. The more literal meaning can
    be thought of as 'is it not like (A)?', due to the uncertainty expressed by か.かのようだmay follow verbs
    and い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns followed by である.When ようだ is altering the meaning of a
    verb or a noun later in the sentence, ように or ような may also be used.This grammar construction will often
    be seen with expressions that emphasize the speaker's assumption about (A), such as まるで. If compared
    to English, this merely strengthens the sentence in a similar way to the difference between 'it's
    as if (A)', and 'it's just as if (A)'.
