  writeup: In the negative-potential form,切れない will attach to theconjunctive formof other verbs, to express
    that a particular action is 'unable to be completed'. Let's look at some examples.Unlike切る, which
    usually attaches to verbs to show that something was done to the point of running out,切れないoften implies
    the exact opposite. This means that the (A) verb cannot be completed specifically because there is
    too much/many of something in order to finish it.切れないmay also imply that something cannot be done
    'to the point of satisfaction'. In this case, the feeling of dissatisfaction is what the speaker considers
    too much to overcome.
