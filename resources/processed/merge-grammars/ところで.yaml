  writeup: ところで is aconjunction particlethat is made up of the noun, ところ 'place', and thecase marking
    particleで. It is used in a similar way to 'by the way', or 'incidentally' in English, but will only
    be used for introducing new topics, not continuing within the same topic.ところで will primarily appear
    at the beginning of a sentence, before making a statement or asking a question about something unrelated.The
    literal translation of ところで is closer to 'and with that', and implies that something (within the previous
    topic) suddenly reminded the speaker of another thing (that happens to be a new topic).CautionWhen
    ところで appears after the past tense of a verb as たところで, it carries a different meaning, and will express
    that something isn't the case, despite (A). This is an advanced grammar point that will be covered
    at another stage.
