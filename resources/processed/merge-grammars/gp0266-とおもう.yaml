  writeup: To express that you 'think' something in Japanese, the common expressionと思うis regularly used.
    As you can probably guess, this is just a combination of the particleと, plus theう-Verb思う.とおもうcan be
    used after any verb,い-Adjective,な-Adjective, or noun, but will requireだafter a noun orな-Adjective.Although
    this structure usually requiresだafter nouns andな-Adjectives, it is often omitted in casual speech.CautionIf
    you want to express what somebody else is thinking,と思っているwill be used. This is due toと思うhaving a sense
    of 'permanence', and thus not something that the speaker could know about another person.と思っているcan
    also be used to express your own thoughts when they are currently happening.
