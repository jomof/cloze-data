    "writeup": "だけでis a combination of theadverbial particleだけ, and thecase marking particleで. This expression is regularly thought of as meaning 'just by (A), (B)'. However, the literal translation is a bit closer to 'with only (A), (B)'. This reflects theでparticle's standard usage of showing a 'tool' that is being used to achieve a certain result.To useだけで, simply attach it to the end of any (non ます) form of verb, or noun.Fun Factだけdiffers fromしかin one very important way.だけhighlights that there is/was more than one option, but that only one thing was chosen/used. However,しかimplies that there is only one possible option to begin with.",

    "writeup": "## The choice of the tense of the verb before だけ depends on (1) whether or not the action expressed by the verb (Action 1) was taken in the past, and (2) whether or not the action/event expressed by the verb (Action 1) precedes the action/event expressed by the main verbal (Action 2). If A1 precedes A2 and A1 is a past action, the verb must be in the past tense (example, Key Sentence (B) and Example (e)). If A1 precedes A2 and A1 is not a past action, the verb is commonly in the nonpast tense, although the past tense is also acceptable (example, Examples (f) - (h)). If A1 does not precede A2 and A1 is a past action, the verb is commonly in the nonpast, although the past tense is also acceptable (example, Example (d)). If A1 does not precede A2 and A1 is not a past action, the verb must be in the nonpast (example, Key Sentence (A) and Examples(a) - (c)).",
