  writeup: As a construction that combines と言う (presenting the previous statement as a quotation) and
    ても, meaning 'even if (A)', or 'even though (A)',と言ってもwill mean 'even if I say (A)', or 'although I
    say (A)'. This expression is used when the speaker wants to highlight (A), but draw the listener's
    attention to (B), in order to clarify something.This expression may be used after any word in almost
    any tense, due to thecase marking particleと is being used in itsquotationrole. However,な-Adjectivesand
    nouns will sometimes be followed byだ(although it is regularly omitted).Fun Fact言う is a う - Verb that
    focuses on what can be said about something, rather than specifically what one person is saying. Due
    to this, if no speaker is identified with が, thenと言ってもcould mean 'although some might say (A)', or
    'even though it is said that (A)'.
