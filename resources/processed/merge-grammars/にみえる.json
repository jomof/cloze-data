    "writeup": "にみえる(primarily written only in hiragana) is a phrase that combines thecase marking particleに, with theる-Verb見える'to appear', or 'to be visible'. This construction is regularly used with nouns, to show that something 'appears to be (A)', but it may also be partnered with theauxiliary verbsようだorそうだ(in their adverbial formsようにandそうに) to add a level of uncertainty. In these cases, it sounds closer to 'to seem to be (A)' in English.As with many otherようだstructures,みたいmay be used instead. This creates the expressionみたいにみえる. While this may appear confusing at first, it just means 'to look like something that could be (A)'. In this way it reinforces the 'guess' that the speaker is making.CautionIn grammar constructions like this, kanji will very rarely be used. This is primarily because it will change the way a native speaker perceives the meaning. Many grammar structures are written purely in hiragana, specifically to express that they are a 'set' construction. Adding kanji can lead a reader to assume that the writer is highlighting the kanji's meaning, rather than the more common grammatical meaning.",
