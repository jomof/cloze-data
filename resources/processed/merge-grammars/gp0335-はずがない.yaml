  writeup: Likeはず, coming from the kanji筈, which suggests that something is 'bound' to be true,はずがないsuggests
    that something is 'not bound' to be true. This expression is usually translated as 'hardly possible',
    'improbable', or 'unlikely', but in reality, it is a bit weaker than these, and translates more literally
    to '(A) is not the only possibility'.Asはずがない(a combination of筈, the case-marking particleが, and theい-Adjectiveない)
    is a phrase that starts with a noun, it may be used after any word that could usually connect with
    a noun.CautionThere is a big difference in nuance between ないはずだ'bound not to', andはずがない'not bound
    to'. ないはずstrongly negates the (A) statement, and expresses the speaker's opinion that it is almost
    definitely not true.はずがないon the other hand, simply suggests that (A) being almost 100% true is not
    the case.
