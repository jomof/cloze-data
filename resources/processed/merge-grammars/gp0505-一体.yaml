  writeup: In order to convey the feeling of 'what the heck', with any 'how', 'what', 'where' or 'why'
    type question, theadverb一体will be used in Japanese. いったい appears frequently both with, and without
    kanji.いったい will usually be seen at the beginning of sentences, before some statement about what the
    speaker finds unbelievable.The literal meaning of いったい is 'one body', or 'one form'. In this way,
    when paired with questions, いったい can be thought of meaning 'in a way that can be understood, what
    is (A)', or 'in a way that makes sense, what is (A)'.Fun FactLike the 'one body', or 'one form' meaning
    mentioned above,一体is sometimes used to mean 'in general', or 'generally' when seen as一体に. However,
    this use is slowly becoming less common, partly due to how often一体is used simply to express surprise
    or shock.
