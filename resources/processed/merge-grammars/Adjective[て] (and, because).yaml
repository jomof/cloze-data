  writeup: The て form of an い-Adjective , or で form of a noun (or な-Adjective ) is exactly the same as
    the て form of a verb, in that it carries the meaning of 'and', and is used for linking.Building on
    from the adjective+て, noun+で grammar point, instead of linking adjectives, adjective+て+(B) is used
    for linking an adjective to an entire phrase. With this construction, the phrase is simply added after
    て (with い-Adjectives ), or で (with nouns and な-Adjectives ), without any extra consideration for the
    phrase following it (this means that the (B) phrase will behave as if it was its own sentence).As
    with adjective+て, noun+で , it should be noted that て and で are different structures here. て is the
    same conjunction particle that is used with verbs (meaning that い-Adjectives are similar to verbs),
    while で is actually a form of だ that is used for conjugation. It is the same で as the one that is
    used in the formal version of だ , である . Which we will learn later.CautionLike other て forms ( ている
    1 , ている 2 , and ている 3 ), the て (or で ) form of other words can have several possible meanings. These
    meanings are as follows.Linking - Like 'and' in English.Reasons - Like 'with (A)', or 'because of
    (A)' in English.Manner - Like 'to do (B) in an (A) way' in English.CautionAs with all other conjugations
    of いい , remember that it will be よくて, and not いくて.
