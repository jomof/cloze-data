  writeup: そうもないis an expression used with verbs in Japanese, to indicate that some particular action
    is very unlikely. It is a combination of theauxiliary verbそう, theadverbial particleも, and theい-Adjectiveない.To
    recap, one of the primary uses of そう is to highlightappearance. Therefore,そうもないliterally means 'to
    not even appear like (A)'. This structure will be used after verbs in theirconjunctive form.Cautionそうもないis
    very similar to そうにない. The primary difference being thatそうもないis stronger. This is due to も expressing
    something that is surprising (or for emphasis), whileにsimply marks a location (or state) within which
    something does or does not exist. The difference can be understood as follows:(A)そうもない- To not even
    look like (A), where 'even' emphasizes (A).(A) そうにない - To not be looking like (A), where 'be' marks
    where (A) is 'not' existing.Cautionそうもないis an expression that is very commonly used with potential
    verbs, in order to convey that the 'possibility' of something cannot be observed. While this translates
    as 'to not appear as if (A) can be done', realistically it comes across quite strongly, similar to
    'to not stand a chance of doing (A)'.
