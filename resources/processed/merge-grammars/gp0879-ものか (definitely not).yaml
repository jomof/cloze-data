  writeup: ものかis a set expression in Japanese that is used to strongly suggest that the previous statement
    absolutely will not happen, or is definitely not true. It is a combination of the noun もの 'thing',
    and theadverbial particleuse of か for conveying 'doubt' or 'uncertainty'. Common translations include
    'definitely not (A)', 'absolutely not (A)', and 'do you really think that (A)'. Literally, the meaning
    is quite close to 'as if' in English, as ものか just poses a strong question to which the speaker already
    completely disagrees with.ものかmay appear after any word that could attach to もの, such as a verbs and
    い-Adjectives, or な-Adjectives and nouns followed by な.Other forms which may be seen areもんか,もんですか,
    andものですか, with women being more traditionally likely to use theもんですかandものですかvariants.Additionally,
    when following the た form of verbs,ものかwill imply that the speaker cannot bear for (A) to eventuate,
    due to evaluating it as something highly negative.Caution - There are several other situations in
    whereものかwill be used, but in each of them it may be easiest to think of the primary translation as
    being 'as if (A)', as it merely implies the speakers shock or disbelief in relation to whatever conditions
    are presented in the previous statement. These 'conditions' may involve an amount, possibility, or
    result of (A).
