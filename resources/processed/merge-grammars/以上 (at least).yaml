  writeup: In order to mark something as 'equal to, or more than (A)',以上will be used. This is simply a
    combination of the kanji以which means 'by means of', and上'above'. This expression may also be translated
    as 'greater than (A)', or 'exceeding (A)'.To use以上, attach it to the amount that you want to highlight
    as the 'minimum' amount.以上is also regularly used as a statement that translates roughly as 'the end',
    or 'that's it', and is a very common way to say that something has finished.Although saying 'the end'
    would sound a bit rude in English in this situation, it is completely natural in Japanese, and literally
    means 'the above (list of things I said) is all'.
