  writeup: A common pattern in Japanese is referring back to a noun that has already been mentioned, without
    actually repeating it.  This is achieved through the use of the particle の , in a similar way to its
    standard possessive use. The noun that would usually follow の is dropped, as it has either been said
    earlier in the sentence, or is understood clearly from context.In these examples, it would also be
    grammatically correct to use the same noun following の , but as can be seen in the English translation,
    it results in unnecessary repetition. This is called word stacking/redundant words ( 重 ね 言葉 ) in Japanese,
    and is considered a poor writing/speech habit. Despite this, it is important to know that this の is
    exactly the same as the possessive の (with the following word simply being left out).In the following
    sentence, we can see another common use of の that translates similarly to 'one' in English, when referring
    to non-specific things.From this, it is clear that the repeated noun is not needed. Japanese is a
    language that avoids repeating words in many situations. This example shows noun replacement, rather
    than noun omission, another common use of の which we will cover in another lesson.
  examples:
    - japanese: あの車、あなたが乗っているのですか。
      english: That car, was it the car (one) you drove? ('Car' repeated, when の 'the one' should have
        been used instead)
    - japanese: その帽子は娘の(帽子)です。
      english: That hat is my daughter's (hat).
    - japanese: あのパソコンは君の(パソコン)でしょう?
      english: That computer is your (computer) right?
    - japanese: 木綿のスカーフは私の(スカーフ)です。
      english: The cotton scarf is my (scarf).
    - japanese: 「この本は誰の(本)?」「先週に来たお客さんの(本)。」
      english: '''Whose book is this (book)?''''It''s the customer''s (who came in last week) (book).'''
    - japanese: この駐車場もあなたの会社の(駐車場)ですか。
      english: This parking lot is also your company's (parking lot)?
