  writeup: どこ is one of the forms of the どれ family of words used to enquire about unknown things. In this
    case it asks about a place. Just like どれ represents 'which', どこ represents 'which place', or simply
    'where'.Cautionどこ should not be confused with どっち, a similar word which is also sometimes translated
    as 'where'. どっち focuses more on the direction that one is/is going, where どこ focuses purely on 'which
    place'.
  examples:
    - japanese: どっち?右?左?
      english: Which way? Right? Left? (Focuses on the direction of movement)
    - japanese: ここはどこですか?
      english: Where is this place? (Focuses on the location)
    - japanese: どこに行きますか。
      english: Where are you going?
    - japanese: すみませんが、この本はどこにありますか。
      english: Excuse me, but where can I find this book?
    - japanese: ここはどこ?
      english: Where is here?
    - japanese: どこがいい?
      english: Where is good?
    - japanese: 美味しいレストランはどこですか。
      english: Where is a delicious restaurant?
