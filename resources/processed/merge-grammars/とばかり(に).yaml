  writeup: とばかりis a construction that is often used to show that something is being done 'as if to say
    (A)', or 'seeming that (A)'. It is a combination of the case-marking particle と in its 'quotation'
    use, and theadverbial particleばかり, exhibiting that something is 'basically exactly as described'.
    Due to this,とばかりsimply indicates that while (A) is as described, it is not literally the case.とばかりcan
    appear after almost any word, as the と is creating a quote. に will often follow ばかり when the sentence
    is going on to describe what is actually happening.とばかりにis an abbreviation ofと言わんばかり'to only just
    not be at the point where (A) is said', which itself will still be seen quite often.In this case,言わん
    is an abbreviation of言わぬ, making use of theclassical auxiliary verbぬ used for negation.CautionAsとばかりにwill
    be used to describe the way that something 'looks like it is about to say', it won't be used for describing
    the speaker themselves. However, it may occasionally be seen being used about the speaker if the sentence
    is in third person.
