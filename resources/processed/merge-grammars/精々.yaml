  writeup: 精々'at the limit' is an adverb used to convey that something is 'at the most (A)', or 'at best
    (A)'. This just indicates that the point that (A) has reached cannot be progressed beyond, due to
    having already reached some physical or metaphorical barrier. This can also often come across as 'no
    more than (A)', especially in cases where no actual barrier exists, but the speaker cannot imagine
    that anything higher (or lower) than (A) is possible.As精々is an adverb, it often appears at the beginning
    of sentence, or at the beginning of the second clause of a sentence, before the thing that is thought
    to be at its maximum is described.Fun-fact -精々is said to have come from the old-fashioned word精試,
    which meant 'to completely exhaust all of one's good faith'. In modern times,精々itself has kept this
    meaning of 'completely exhausting (A)'. However, this is no longer used in reference to 'good faith',
    but rather exhausting all of one's 'power', 'mental capacity', or 'power of assumption' in relation
    to (A).
