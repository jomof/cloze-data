  writeup: まで is a particle that roughly means 'as far as (A)', or 'until the point of (A)'. When used
    with verbs, it is often translated as 'until (A) happens'.Because まで means 'as far as/until the point
    of', it cannot be used with verbs in past tense, as would usually be the case in English. Due to this,
    past tense will be made clear by the context of the story, or verbs that come later in the sentence.When
    used with a place, まで functions similarly to に. This means that someone or something will go 'to'
    the place, but not go any further.CautionTo get a better idea of how まで is used in relation to the
    past, let's have a look at another example, and how it would translate in English.Here we can see
    that the English sentence will say 'started', but 始 まる 'start' ( non-past tense ) is required in Japanese.
    However, later in the sentence, 来 なかった ( past tense ) is used. In this way, the overall meaning stays
    the same, while being slightly different to what an English native speaker would expect.

      english: The teacher didn't come until the class started.
    - japanese: 映画が始まるまで、友達と話した。

    - japanese: 彼が来るまで、日本語を勉強します。

    - japanese: カタカナを覚えるまで、私は寝ない。
      english: Until I memorize katakana, I won't sleep.
    - japanese: その漢字を覚えるまで、辞書を使う。
      english: Until I remember that kanji, I will use a dictionary.
    - japanese: お風呂に入るまで、ゆっくりしたい。
      english: Until I get in the bath, I want to relax.
