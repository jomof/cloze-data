  writeup: When grouped with に, the う-Verb関わる 'to be concerned with' is frequently used to show a relation
    between (A) and (B). This grammar pattern may be translated as 'relating to (A), (B)', 'concerning
    (A), (B)', or '(B) that has to do with (A)'.This structure appears after nouns, and is occasionally
    followed directly to a second noun in order to modify its meaning. Also, it is most common to see
    this pattern in its non-kanji form.This grammar pattern may also highlight that (A) is something that
    the speaker should be cautious about, due to a potential negative outcome.Caution - Despite being
    similar toに関する,にかかわるimplies a deeper, more important relationship between (A) and (B), so they are
    not completely interchangeable.
