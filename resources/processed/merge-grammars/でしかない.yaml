  writeup: でしかないis a construction comprised of the conjunctive form of だ, で, the particle しか, and the
    い-Adjective, ない. Like all other しか based structures, it is used to indicate that the target word is
    'no more than (A)', or 'merely (A)'. The primary difference withでしかないcompared to other similar grammar
    patterns is that it will only appear directly after nouns.Althoughでしかないcan be used with either a positive
    or negative nuance, it tends to be seen more frequently with a slightly negative nuance in relation
    to (A), indicating that it has no value or significant meaning beyond (A).
