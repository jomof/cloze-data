  writeup: どうにも is an expression that is often paired with negative structures such as できない 'cannot',
    ならない 'won't happen', or ようがない 'no way'. It is a combination of theadverbどう 'how', thecase marking
    particleに, and theadverbial particleも, and may be translated as 'even however (A), still not (B)'.
    The whole structure itself is usually interpreted simply as 'it is meaningless to (A)', 'there's nothing
    one can do about (A)', or nothing will come of (A)'.どうにも will primarily be seen either at the start
    or end of sentences, after or before going on to explain a situation which seems impossible due to
    some specific reason.This grammar pattern emphasizes the speaker's feelings of resignation, frustration,
    or regret in relation to something that is out of their control. Due to this, it often highlights
    the actions of someone other than the speaker.Occasionally, どうにも is further emphasized by the addition
    of こうにも.
