  writeup: としてもis a structure used in Japanese for expressing thoughts about (A), assuming that it were
    what is being described. This may be translated as 'even if we assume that it's (A)', or 'assuming
    that (A)'. However, the literal translation is quite close to 'even going off that it were (A), (B)',
    asとしてもsimply expresses that despite (A) not being true, the speaker is willing to say that it is for
    arguments sake, before giving their thoughts about that hypothetical situation.としてもwill be seen following
    verbs and い-Adjectives, or nouns and な-Adjectives that are followed by だ.In some cases,としてもjust functions
    as an extension ofとして'as', and can be interpreted as 'even as (A)'. This nuance primarily highlights
    people or organizations in the position of (A), and states that 'even for (A), it will still be (B)'.
    Unlike the previous nuance, thisとしてもwill only be used with nouns.
