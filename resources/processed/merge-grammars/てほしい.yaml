  writeup: As mentioned in our lesson about 'saying that you want something' withがほしい, sometimes ほしい can
    be used as auxiliary adjective (an adjective that needs to be connected to another word in order to
    have meaning). In these cases, it will follow theconjunction particle,て. When used this way,てほしいexpresses
    that the speaker 'wants somebody to do something'.To useてほしい, simply change the verb that you 'want
    someone to do' into itsて-form, and then add ほしい.Cautionてほしいcan also be used to ask questions/explain
    about what other people want you (or somebody else) to do. Due to this, we will need to be careful
    when trying to identify who wants who to do what.
