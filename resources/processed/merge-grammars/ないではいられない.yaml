  writeup: In order to express that something cannot be helped or cannot be resisted in Japanese, the
    phraseないではいられないwill be used. This is a structure that is comprised of verbs in the negative form connected
    to で, は, and the negative-potential form of the る-Verb居る 'to be'. In this way it just means 'to be
    unable to be without (A)'.ないではいられないprimarily expresses the inability of the speaker to tolerate (A)
    not happening, due to wanting to do it. It may also indicate that they will unfortunately do it despite
    knowing that they shouldn't.ないではいられない may also be used to highlight that in the situation of (A),
    some particular emotion, feeling, or reaction cannot be repressed. (B) is something that happens naturally
    as a consequence of (A).
