  writeup: からいうと (appearing with or without kanji) is a phrase in Japanese that is used to express a particular
    viewpoint or standpoint from which some type of evaluation, conclusion, or opinion can be drawn. The
    と that appears here is one of theassumptionuses of this particle, meaning that から言えば may also be used.からいうと
    will always follow a noun (or noun phrase), before the (B) part of that same sentence will describe
    some kind of evaluation/opinion/etc. This structure closely reflects phrases like 'speaking in terms
    of (A), (B)', or 'what can be drawn from (A) is that (B)'.Occasonally, the use of particles such as
    と orばmay be skipped entirely, with から言って being used instead.Caution'Name+からいうと' may not be used with
    this expression, as a person is not a 'situation'. However, it is perfectly ok to use something like
    'name の立場からいうと', as this highlights a specific situation that the said person is in.CautionDue to
    からいうと regularly highlighting some sort of 'overall situation', it will not be used with momentary/visual
    things. In these cases, while not strictly incorrect, it may sound quite unnatural to a native speaker.A
    more appropriate choice here would be something like から見ると, as this can be used to make purely visual
    assessments.
