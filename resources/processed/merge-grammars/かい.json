    "writeup": "Thesentence ending particleかいis a grammar structure that is used in Japanese to highlight a question. Despite commonly being thought of as one word, it is actually the combination ofか(the sentence-ending particle) and い, another sentence-ending particle that is primarily used by men (in a similar way toねandよ).かいwill usually be used directly after the word/phrase that it is highlighting. In the case of verbs andい-Adjectives,のmay be inserted beforeかい. Forな-Adjectivesand nouns,なのmay be inserted directly before it. However,の(orなの) are frequently omitted, due to how casualかいis.When it is not omitted,の(orなの) may be shortened to ん (or なん). This is in the same way thatのandなのwould behave in theのですandなのですgrammar structures.Although there are some exceptions,かいwill almost always be used to ask simple yes/no questions.CautionBecauseかいis very casual, and quite direct, it often sounds like an accusation. Due to this, care should be taken with your tone of voice, so as not to be taken the wrong way.Fun FactOutside ofかい, the sentence ending particle い is not commonly used in modern Japanese, and therefore will only appear in a few very specific structures (like だい). Despite being similar toね, い is considered to be fairly ぞんざい 'rough', and should only be used with people that you are very familiar with, and never to someone above you.",
