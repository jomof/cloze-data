  writeup: ぞ is a sentence-ending particle that is used for emphasis in a similar way to よ. However, it
    is quite a bit stronger and primarily only used by men. While よ may simply state a point or a fact,
    ぞ is usually reserved for more forcefully highlighting something. In many cases, it will just be translated
    as an exclamation point.ぞ may be used at the end of any sentence, but can only follow conjugatable
    words such as verbs, adjectives, and auxiliary verbs.The speaker frequently uses ぞ simply to encourage
    or convince themselves, rather than specifically directing the statement at another.CautionAlthough
    uncommon, ぞ may also be used as an adverbial particle in the same way as は. In sentences like this,
    it is more emphatic and draws extra attention to the topic itself.Additionally, this use of ぞ as an
    adverbial particle may also follow question words such as どこ ‘where’, 誰 ‘who’, なに ‘what’, etc.This
    use is also emphatic, but not quite to the same extent as with standard nouns.
