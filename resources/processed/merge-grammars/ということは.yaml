  writeup: ということはis a phrase in Japanese that often appears in the middle of sentences, expressing that
    the previous statement is something that is about to be clarified. This can be translated as 'that
    means', or 'that is to say'.ということはbased sentences will often finish withということだ, although it is not
    limited to appearing this way.The more literal translation is something similar 'that which is said
    to be (A), (B)'. In this way, it simply presents (A) as a thing that requires further explaining.Additionally,ということはwill
    appear at the beginning of sentences, when the speaker is confirming their understanding about something
    that has just been said. Often in the form of a question. In these cases, the translation is similar
    'so you mean to say that (A)?'.As can be seen from the breakdown of という, こと, and は, this statement
    just expresses that the 'thing' which is 'classified as' (A) is 'in general' understood to be (B).
