  writeup: や否や, like か否か, is a grammar pattern that makes use of否'no', an interjection. However, unlike
    the pairing with theadverbial particleか 'or' when stating 'whether or not (A)', the  pairing of否with
    や in its role as aconjunction particlehas the meaning of 'as soon as (A)', or 'no sooner than (A)'.
    Remembering that や simply highlights the word before it is not being limited to that, the literal
    meaning ofや否やis 'at a point when neither (A) or not (A) could be determined, (B)'.や否や will be used
    after verbs in theirdictionary form.や否やis a formal expression that will generally be used when (B)
    is something that happens spontaneously, or is surprising.CautionAs や itself carries the 'not limited
    to' meaning, it is also possible to see this structure with the否や part omitted. In these situations,
    the meaning will not change at all. や in this case behaves similarly to か when presenting a question
    in the middle of a sentence, and sounds like 'when not certain that (A), (B)'.
