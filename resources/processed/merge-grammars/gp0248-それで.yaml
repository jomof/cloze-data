  writeup: Likeそれに,それでis anotherconjunctionthat is regularly considered to be one word in Japanese, but
    is more correctly just a combination of thepronounそれ, and thecase marking particleで.The thing thatそれis
    'substituting' for is the entire clause/sentence that came before it, whileでhighlights that 'with
    that', or 'by means of that'. In this way, it translates to 'therefore', 'because of that', or 'with
    that' where 'that' is the previous information.それでis frequently used at the beginning of a second
    sentence, to highlight the information from the first.CautionYou may also seeそれでは.でin this case is
    theconjunctive formofだ(the auxiliary verb). Due to this, the meaning is closer to 'well then', 'in
    that case', or 'if so'. Thisではis also frequently shortened toじゃ.
