  writeup: あまりis a very flexible word in Japanese, that is used in several different grammar points. When
    paired with the ない form of a word, it translates to 'not very (A)', or 'hardly (A)'. To pairあまり(or
    the casual form,あんまり) with another word, we just need to place it at the beginning of a phrase, or
    directly before the ない statement.Fun FactAlthoughあまり〜ないis regularly translated as 'not very' the literal
    translation is closer to 'not excessively (A)'. This is due to余り(the kanji which this word comes from),
    meaning 'excessive', or 'to be in excess'.あまりhas this meaning of 'excessive' in all of its grammar
    points, and the nuance will only change based on whether the sentence itself is positive (does not
    use ない), or negative (uses ない).
