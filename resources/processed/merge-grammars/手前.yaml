  writeup: Thenoun手前'in front of' has several different meanings in Japanese depending on whether it is
    being used with a verb in itsstandard form, or with a noun.Regarding verbs, it expresses 'going forward
    from (A), (B)'. This is usually in relation to something that has happened either accidentally or
    completely, and may represent what will be done as a result of being in that situation.This can also
    be interpreted as 'now that (A), (B)', and simply highlights that nothing can be done except to move
    on or 'forward' given the current circumstances.When手前appears with nouns followed by thecase marking
    particleの, it often expresses that what is 'in front' of (A) is the reason for (B), or simply is 'in
    front of (B)'.Despite the many translations,手前always shows something that is 'facing' the noun or
    verb that appears with it. Due to this, thinking of this structure as similar to 'faced with (A),
    (B)' may be helpful, as English also expresses lack of option and finality in this way.
