  writeup: When thenounこと (or事in its kanji form) is combined with なの, it conveys an explanatory meaning
    that is similar to what can be seen in theんです・のですgrammar pattern. As withんです,ことなのtransforms 'it is
    (A)', into 'it is that it is (A)', simply emphasizing the point.ことなのmay be seen in several different
    forms, and is quite often used in conjunction withというのは. In these types of sentences,というのはwill present
    the topic, beforeことなのwill be used to show the conclusion that the speaker has drawn about that topic.This
    expression may be used with any word in itsattributive form, nouns followed by の, orな-Adjectivesfollowed
    by な.という may also be used directly beforeことなの. However, this is not always the case, and is even more
    unlikely when it was already utilized in the first half of the sentence.CautionAsというのはis quite long,
    it will often be shortened to って or とは in casual speech.Cautionことなのis also frequently used when asking
    questions. This is usually when the speaker has drawn a conclusion about something that has been said,
    and wants to confirm their understanding.なのか is very frequently heard/seen in drama, novels, manga,
    and similar types of media, but may be considered rude in daily speech.
