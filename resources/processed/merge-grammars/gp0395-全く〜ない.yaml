  writeup: 全く〜ないis an expression that combines theadverb全く, with a phrase that uses another word in its
    ない form. It is often translated as 'not at all (A)'. Literally, it is closer to 'completely not (A)',
    or 'entirely not (A)', coming from the kanji全's meaning of 'whole'.Like many other adverbs, まったく may
    be used at the beginning of a sentence, or directly before the word that it is describing as being
    'not at all' (A).It is common to see this expression using both the kanji form, and plain hiragana
    form of全く, so both should be learned early.Cautionまったく is very similar to全然, another grammar point
    that is used to highlight the complete lack of something. However, まったく tends to sound a little bit
    more serious, and is therefore more likely to be used in formal writing/situations.全然on the other
    hand is far more common in casual speech.
