  writeup: Being a combination of に and the う-Verb先立つ 'to take the lead', or 'to precede', this structure
    connects to both nouns and verbs in their dictionary forms, to indicate that (B) is a preliminary
    step required for (A). It may be interpreted as 'before (A), (B)', 'prior to (A), (B)', or 'in preference
    over (A), (B)'.Despite these several interpretations, the literal meaning of 'standing before (A),
    (B)' can be useful to remember, as it highlights the importance of (B) as a first step.As先立つ is a
    verb, it may be seen in its dictionary from when followed directly by another noun, or in its て-form
    when indicating the whole (B) phrase as preceding (A). Additionally, the formal-conjunctive form,先立ち
    will often be used in preference of the て-form, asに先立つis a formal grammar structure.Fun-fact -先立つ
    may often be seen paired with物, and is a set expression in these cases that translates similarly to
    'means' in English. This 'means' refers to the prerequisites required to enable something, and will
    usually appear in negative sentences, in order to show that one 'does not have the means to do (A)'.
