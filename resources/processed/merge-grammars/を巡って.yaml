    Register: Formal
    使用域: 硬い
  writeup: One of the more indirect ways that 'to be concerning (A)' is conveyed in Japanese is through
    the pairing of a noun with thecase marking particleを and the う-Verb巡る 'to go around' in either its
    て-form, or standard form when paired with a second noun.This grammar point can be translated as 'concerning
    (A)', 'in regard to (A)', or 'about (A)'. However, following the most natural translation, we can
    see that 'to go around the topic of (A)', or 'encompassing (A)' are also acceptable.Caution - In addition
    to being quite formal,を巡ってkeeps the 'around the topic of (A)' nuance that comes from the stem verb.
    This means that rather than expressing one opinion, it takes into consideration many different viewpoints,
    and is frequently used when there is a disagreement or dispute about (A).Because of this, it can sound
    quite unnatural to useを巡ってif the topic of (A) is simply a personal opinion.
