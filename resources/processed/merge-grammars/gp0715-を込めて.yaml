  writeup: をこめて, orを込めてwhen appearing in its kanji form, is a phrase that expresses when something is
    'full of (A)', or 'filled with (A)'. The structure is comprised of を, and the て-form of the る-Verb込める,
    which means 'to pack into', or 'to load with'. In this way, the literal meaning is fairly consistent
    with the standard English translations.をこめてwill appear directly after the noun expressing the particular
    feeling or emotion being discussed.Caution - It is important to note that this particular structure
    is treated as a set phrase, and will primarily only be used when some particular feeling or emotion
    is the thing that is being 'packed into (A)'.
