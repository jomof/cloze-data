  writeup: In Japanese, many particles are often grouped together with thecase marking particleの. The
    primary function of this is to form a link between noun (A), and noun (B). In each of these cases,
    noun (B) will be considered to have all of the qualities described by noun (A), and the first particle
    that follows it.The particle that comes before の will always be something that adds some form of immediate
    information about noun (A). The most common ones are as follows:Noun (A) から の Noun (B) - The (B) that
    is 'from' (A).Noun (A) と の Noun (B) - The (B) that is 'grouped with' (A).Noun (A) へ の Noun (B) - The
    (B) that is 'toward' (A).Noun (A) で の Noun (B) - The (B) that 'done with' (A).Noun (A) まで の Noun (B)
    - The (B) that is 'until' (A).CautionBecause noun (A) is describing noun (B), noun (B) will be considered
    as the subject of the statement. Due to this, particles that usually mark subjects, topics, or objects
    of actions cannot be paired directly with の. This includes に, も, は, が, andを.
