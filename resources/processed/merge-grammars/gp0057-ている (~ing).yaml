  writeup: ている is a construction used in Japanese to convey that someone or something is existing in a
    constant state of 'doing' the verb that comes before て . In English, depending on the verb, this can
    be translated as 'is (A)', 'am (A), or 'are (A)~ing'. The expression is made by adding いる to the て
    form of either る-Verbs , or う-Verbs .Due to いる being one of the verbs for 'existing' in Japanese,
    the ている form means something closer to 'continuing to exist in a specific state', rather than (A)~ing
    in English. This is why verbs like 死ぬ , and 知る , appear as the ている form in Japanese, when they would
    appear as the past form in English.
  examples:
    - japanese: 何をしている?
      english: What are you doing?
    - japanese: 寿司を食べている。
      english: I am eating sushi.
    - japanese: 今、勉強していないよ。
      english: I am not studying now.
    - japanese: 彼は図書館で日本語を勉強しているだろう。
      english: He is studying Japanese at the library, right?
    - japanese: 私のお父さんが、高い時計をしています。
      english: My father is wearing an expensive watch.

  writeup: '## 1. いる is used as an auxiliary verb with Verb-て and expresses the continuation of an action
    or state. In general, if Verb-て expresses an action which can continue or be repeated, Verb-て expresses
    the continuation of the action. If Verb-て is a verb indicating a momentary action which cannot be
    repeated, Verb-て expresses the idea that something happened to X and X maintains the state which was
    created by that event. Key Sentence and Example (a) are examples of the first usage and Examples (b),
    (c) and (d) are examples of the second usage. Note in Example (d) that 知る the dictionary form of 知って,
    means ''to get to know'' and 知っている expresses the continuation of the state after the speaker got to
    know Miss Suzuki, which is expressed by know in English. It is also noted, however, that ''not to
    know'' is not 知っていない but 知らない.'
