  writeup: いかんis a grammar structure that has evolved as an abbreviation ofいかん, anadverbmeaning 'in what
    way'. In almost all circumstances, it can be translated directly as 'depending on', and will be followed
    by either theauxiliary verbだ at the end of sentences, or theconjunctive formof だ, で, when used in
    the middle of a sentence.いかんwill follow nouns, and may or may not be preceded by の.Occasionally,いかんwill
    be followed by によって. This may seem like repetition for no particular reason, but in most cases it
    will just strengthen the original meaning of 'depending on', and can be literally translated as 'depending
    on what way (A) is oriented, (B)'.いかんitself is used in a very similar way to次第'upon (A)', or 'depending
    on (A)', and more often than not implies that the degree of (A) will be the factor that determines
    the overall result. Due to this, it will often be followed by subclauses that use verbs of decision
    making such as決まる.Fun Factいかん, like いかに, is simply another word that has the same meaning as どう 'how',
    and even shares the same kanji structure of如何,如何. It is also quite common to see the structure かどうであるによって
    'depending on in what way' used as an explanation for the meaning ofいかんin various dictionaries and
    other teaching resources. Due to this, it may be beneficial to simply considerいかんas a less common
    version of どう, or かどうである.
