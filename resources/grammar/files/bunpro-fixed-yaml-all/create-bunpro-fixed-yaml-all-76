writeup: う-Verbs include all of the verbs in Japanese that end in う sounds (including some of the verbs
  that end in る). These verbs are called Godan ( 五段 ) 'five-level' verbs in Japanese, due to their conjugations
  using all 5 of the different sounds in the same column ( 段 ) that their base form comes from.As we can
  see here, the く in 聞 く changes to き when conjugated to the polite form. All of the other sounds the
  K-column will be used with 聞 く, depending on the conjugation. This is the same for all of the う-Verbs.聞
  （か） ない, 聞 （き） たい , 聞 （く） , 聞 （け）る , 聞 （こ）うHere we can see the う-Verb 聞 く using all of the different
  K-column sounds in various conjugations.CautionJust like with る-Verbs , the base form of the verb may
  be called 'plain form', 'casual form', or 'short form', depending on the source/book.
