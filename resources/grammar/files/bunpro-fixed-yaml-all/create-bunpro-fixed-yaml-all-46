writeup: Like ここ and そこ , あそこ is a word that is used to identify a place in Japanese. The place that あそこ
  will be used to identify is somewhere that is separated from both the speaker and the listener. This
  translates roughly to 'that place over there' in English. あそこ can be used to identify both physical
  locations, and emotional ones.In the same way that あれ can be used to point back to something that was
  mentioned previously, あそこ can be used to point back to a place that was mentioned previously. However,
  unlike それ or そこ , あれ and あそこ will only be used this way when both the speaker and listener have intimate
  knowledge of the topic.Cautionあそこ should not be confused with あっち, a similar word which is also sometimes
  translated as 'over there'. あっち focuses more on the direction that one is/is going, while あそこ focuses
  purely on 'that place'.
