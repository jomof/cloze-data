writeup: When seen in sentences containing verbs negated with theauxiliary verbない, とても carries the nuance
  of 'not (A) at all', or 'cannot (A) at all'. とても is supposed to only be used when expressing 'impossibility',不可能.
  Due to this, it will primarily appear alongside the potential form of verbs.Fun FactAs long as some
  part of the sentence expresses the speaker's view about the impossibility of (A), the verb is not always
  required to be in the negative form.
