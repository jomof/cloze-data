writeup: Theadverbial particleもis often used for labeling (A) as part of a category, when it would not
  usually be considered part of that group. In this way, it emphasizes that (A)'s inclusion is something
  that is surprising/unexpected in some way.Whenもis used after a specific number + counter, it shows that
  the number itself is surprising. This can be when the actual number is lower, or higher than what was
  expected. Due to this,もcan translate as 'as much as (A)', or 'not even (A)', and other similar phrases
  in this expression.At first glance, this may seem different thanも's translation as 'too' or 'also',
  but in those cases,もis also just pointing out the something unexpected is part or whatever group was
  initially highlighted.The above sentence just shows that the (B) speaker is unexpectedly putting themselves
  in the group that the (A) speaker initially only considered themselves to be a part of.
