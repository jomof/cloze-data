writeup: Although it is often considered a stand-aloneadverb,必ずしも is a combination of the adverb必ず 'invariably',
  or 'certainly', and theadverbial particlesし and も. し and も are often combined in order to strengthen
  the meaning of the word before it. Due to this,必ずしも may be translated as something similar to 'absolutely
  certainly'.However,必ずしも is an expression that is only used in negative sentences, so is commonly translated
  as 'not always (A)', 'not entirely (A)', or 'not necessarily (A)'. Despite this, the literal meaning
  is close to 'not absolutely certainly (A)'.必ずしも is often used at the beginning of a phrase, before expressing
  something that is not 100% certain.
