writeup: が is considered to be the subject marker in Japanese. This means that it marks someone or something
  that is performing an action, or it identifies someone or something as having a specific feature (this
  is usually a feature that the listener is not aware of).In both of these sentences, が puts focus on
  the thing performing an action/existing in some way (as opposed to any other thing). Because of this,
  が is usually said to highlight what comes before it, while は highlights what comes after it.が always
  shows the 'target' of a statement, when other targets also exist. This is why が is used to describe
  situations that are happening either 'in the moment', or 'individually of other things'.Because the
  group in this sentence is only one group out of many possible 'groups of people' that could be described,
  が will be used.Cautionが is not usually used to describe something about yourself, unless you are intentionally
  describing yourself compared to other people. If you want to talk about yourself 'in general terms',
  は will sound more natural (there are exceptions).
