writeup: か is a particle that frequently comes at the end of sentences in Japanese, and carries the same
  meaning as a question mark in English. (It is not limited to appearing at the end of sentences, however).
  In addition to questions, か can also express uncertainty about something, without strictly being a question.か
  regularly comes after the polite form of words, such as ～ です か , ～ます か . However, in casual conversation,
  か can be used directly after the word that the speaker is showing uncertainty about.Both examples are
  grammatically correct, but the sentence without です may be considered rude by some people (as it sounds
  too familiar/direct).
examples:
  - japanese: これは本ですか。
    english: Is this a book?
  - japanese: これはあなたの本ですか。
    english: Is this your book?
  - japanese: これもあなたの本ですか。
    english: Is this also your book?
  - japanese: これはペンですか。
    english: Is this a pen?
  - japanese: これはいいですか。
    english: Is this good?
