writeup: へ is a particle used when describing a place that someone or something is 'moving toward', or
  'in contact with'. In many cases, the particles に and へ are interchangeable, but there is a slight difference
  in meaning. へ focuses more on the distance/effort required to get between (A) and (B), while に focuses
  more on the connection between (A) and (B). へ always comes after the noun signifying the destination.In
  these examples, while they may seem the same at first glance, へ shows that there is a space between
  (A) and (B), while に puts the emphasis solely on the destination. This is why common expressions such
  as 'city/country name へ ようこそ' sound very polite. It is like saying 'Welcome, and we acknowledge your
  journey/effort to get here'.In the TV-show example, this commonly means 'thank you for your effort to
  watch this particular show, out of all the ones you could have chosen'.

  - japanese: 大阪へようこそ。

  - japanese: 私は電車で大阪へ行く。
    english: I go to Osaka by train.
  - japanese: 神戸へ行く。
    english: To go to Kobe.
  - japanese: 家へ帰る。
    english: To return to one's house.
