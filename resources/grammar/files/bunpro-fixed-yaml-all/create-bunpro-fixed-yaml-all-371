writeup: Noun, い-Adjective , or な-Adjective + てもいい is a construction in Japanese that is used to express
  that something is 'okay', or 'alright'. It is also frequently used as a question to ask if you 'can',
  or 'may' do something.As can be seen, with い-Adjectives , we will need to use the conjugation form.
  This is created by removing the い and then replacing it with く.This phrase is also regularly used without
  the も , but is considered a bit more direct/casual in those cases. It is best to remove the も only when
  talking to people that you know well.てもいい is an expression that literally means て (noun, etc) も (also)
  いい (is good).Similarly to the てもいい grammar point that is used with verbs, this variant may also be used
  as a question. To do this, you simply need to follow てもいい with です か , or the more casual の .

  - japanese: 高くてもいい。

  - japanese: 水曜日でもいいですか。
