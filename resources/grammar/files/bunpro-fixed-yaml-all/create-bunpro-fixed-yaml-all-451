writeup: 疾っくに, seen primarily asとっくに, is an adverb that can be translated roughly as 'long ago'. This
  word is an emphasized version of疾うに, a literary form which is not used much in modern Japanese.とっくにis
  a sentence altering adverb, so will appear most often at the beginning of sentences, or before the verb
  it is describing as having happened a long time ago.When compared with structures likeすでにandもう,とっくにwill
  either indicate something that has happened much further in the past, or may be used simply for exaggeration.Fun-fact
  - It is uncommon to seeとっくにlisted with an exact time, as the stem (old Japanese) word疾し already means
  something close to 'far earlier', or 'at a much earlier time'.
