writeup: に気が付くis a common expression that highlights when someone 'notices that (A)', or 'realizes that
  (A)'.付く 'to be attached' is the intransitive form of付ける 'to attach', meaning that it is something that
  happens by itself. Thecase marking particleにmarks the 'location' to where your気(sometimes interpreted
  as 'attention') becomes attached.This structure may be used after nouns, or verbs that have been nominalized
  with eitherの, orこと.Fun FactThere are many different translations for気in English. These can range from
  'spirit', to 'attention', to 'will', or even 'consciousness'. However, perhaps one of the most accurate
  ways to translate気, is 'presence of mind'. The 'location' to which your focus, attention, or perception
  is drawn, will always highlight your気.
