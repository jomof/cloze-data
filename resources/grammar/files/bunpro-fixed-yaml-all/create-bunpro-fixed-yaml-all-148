writeup: Coming from thenoun気味meaning 'sensation',ぎみis asuffixthat is used to convey weak signs of (A).ぎみmay
  be used with nouns, or theconjunctive formof verbs. Often,ぎみis translated as 'looking (A)', 'a touch
  of (A)', 'feeling a little (A)', or 'slightly (A)'.ぎみrefers to the senses of the person who is experiencing
  them, and therefore may be used to refer to feelings about other people/things, or feelings about oneself.Asぎみexpresses
  'weak signs of (A)', it is often used to soften a statement, so that the speaker does not appear overconfident.CautionAlthough
  it comes from気味,ぎみwill always be said with a ぎ, and not a き. This is a sound change used to distinguish
  the noun and thesuffix.
