writeup: 嫌い, meaning 'to dislike', is one of the very commonな-Adjectivesin Japanese that is used in many
  different expressions. Allな-Adjectivesbehave similarly to verbs, in that their form changes depending
  on what comes after them.For 嫌い , it will be followed by either な , when acting as an adjective, だ ,
  or the more polite です , when acting as a noun. This distinction is made depending on whether it is linked
  to another noun, or is independent.In the example with だ , 嫌い is expressing that the thing is 'dislikable'
  (assertion). However, in the example with な , 嫌い is expressing 'being disliked' as a quality of the
  noun it is attached to.In the same way that 好き can often be partnered with 大 to mean 'love', 嫌い can
  often be partnered with 大 to mean 'hate'.CautionDespite ending in い, 嫌い is one of the few words that
  is actually a な-Adjective , and needs to be memorized.
