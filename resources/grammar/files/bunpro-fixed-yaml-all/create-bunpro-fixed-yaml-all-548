writeup: Like 易い , にくい is an い-Adjective that is regularly attached to the ます stem of verbs. However,
  instead of meaning 'easy to (A)', it means 'difficult to (A)'. (A) will always represent the verb that
  comes before にくい .The nuance of にくい is that (A) is a task that is difficult to do, because of the required
  skill level, or similar factors. This is different from づらい, which focuses more on a task that is difficult
  due to being unbearable/hard to endure for some reason.Fun FactAn easy way to remember the difference
  in nuance between にくい and づらい, is that にくい comes from the same kanji as 難 しい, which usually carries
  the meaning of 'difficulty' (in relation to skill being required).
