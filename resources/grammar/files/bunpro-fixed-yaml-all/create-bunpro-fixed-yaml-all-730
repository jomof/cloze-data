writeup: もの, an extremely common noun in Japanese that means 'thing', can also be used as asentence ending
  particle. In these cases, it adds a small amount of emotion to a statement, and presents it as a reason.
  Due to this,ものis usually translated as 'because', or 'cause'. Literally, it just means 'it's an (A)
  thing!'.ものis quite casual, so should be avoided in formal situations.To useものas 'because', attach it
  to the end of theplain formof any word.To emphasizeものeven further, the explanatory んだ (after a verb
  orい-Adjective), or なんだ (after aな-Adjectiveor noun) will often be used.Cautionものcan be shortened toもんin
  its use as a sentence ending particle. However, this makes the statement sound far more 'cute' or 'childish'.
  Due to this, it should be avoided in standard conversation.Fun FactAlthough it is not used regularly
  in standard Japanese, んですもの is a slightly more polite version of んだもの that appears frequently in anime,
  manga, and novels.
