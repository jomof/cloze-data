writeup: でしょう is a conjugated form of です , and can also be seen in the contracted form でしょ (more casual).
  でしょう is regularly translated to 'right?', or 'probably' in English. In a broader sense it just expresses
  an assertion about something (like です ), that the speaker assumes the listener would probably agree
  with.In the above, we can see that, in both examples, the speaker is looking for confirmation that/affirming
  that the listener agrees with them.As でしょう is a conjugation of です (the polite form of だ), it usually
  follows the plain form of words, rather than words using ～ます. However, in very formal situations, or
  older literature ～ます でしょう may be seen.CautionDespite sounding relatively low confidence, using でしょう
  implies that the speaker has some form of information that makes them believe that the (A) statement
  is true.
