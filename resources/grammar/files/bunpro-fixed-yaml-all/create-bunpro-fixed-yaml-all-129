writeup: がある is a common construction that is simply a combination of the が particle, and the う-Verb ,
  ある . This expression means 'to exist', or 'there is', and is used in relation to non-living/inanimate
  things.Because the things being described in these examples are not considered to be 'alive', ある is
  the verb that will be used. いる is used for living things.The polite form of ある conjugates as あります .
  Due to the る changing to り, we can determine that ある is a う-Verb (Godan verb) . However, ある is irregular
  in that the plain negative form is ない , not あらない.The kanji form of 有る is quite common, and should be
  learned as early as possible, to save any confusion while reading. There is no nuance difference between
  this expression being used with, or without kanji, and is up to the preference of the writer.CautionThe
  が in がある is often omitted in casual speech, or writing that behaves like casual speech (manga, instant
  messaging, etc).
