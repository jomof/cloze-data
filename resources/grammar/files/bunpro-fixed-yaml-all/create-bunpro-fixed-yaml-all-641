writeup: In Japanese, のは and のが behave in a very similar way to the words 'that' and 'which' in English.
  This means that they perform a task called nominalization . Nominalization is when a phrase is treated
  in the same way as a single noun.Rather than a single noun, we can see from these examples that the
  phrases 沢山 食 べ る のは and バスに 乗 る のが are behaving in the same way that a single noun would. In English,
  this can either mean 'that which', or 'the one who/that'.This construction can be used after verbs in
  any tense, except for the polite ます or ません, which are only used at the end of a sentence, or certain
  clauses.Cautionの cannot be used as a substitute for こと in set expressions like ことができる , or ことがある . It
  also may not be followed by だ , である , or です , as this would become the explanatory ～んです , or のです in
  that case.
examples:
  - japanese: この仕事をするのは私だ。
    english: I am the one who does this job.
  - japanese: 読むのは私です。
    english: I am the one who reads.
  - japanese: 寿司を食べるのは、彼だ。
    english: He is the one who eats sushi.
  - japanese: 漢字を覚えるのは、彼女です。
    english: She is the one who remembers kanji.
  - japanese: 文法を勉強するのは、私です。
    english: I am the one who studies grammar.
