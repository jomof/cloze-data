writeup: 間にis an expression that can be used with almost any type of word, to highlight that (A) is the
  period/space within which something else will or did happen/exist. It may also be a period/space 'until'
  something else will or did happen/exist. It is a combination of the noun間, and thecase marking particleに.When
  used with verbs orい-Adjectives,間にwill simply follow the verb/adjective. However, の will be required
  after nouns, while な will be required afterな-Adjectives.When間にis being used to express the period/space
  'until' something happens/exists, it will be paired with まで.With間に, the (B) action/location is usually
  something that can or did happen/exist at a 'specific' point during (A), and does/did not take up the
  whole time-frame/space of (A). In this way, it can translate more literally as 'in the span of (A)'.
  This comes from the kanji間's common meaning as 'an interval'.
