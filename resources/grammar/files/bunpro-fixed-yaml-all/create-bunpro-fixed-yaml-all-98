writeup: When 方 is attached to the ます stem of a verb, it carries the nuance of the 'way of doing (A)'.
  This is identical to 方 's standard meaning of 'way', or 'direction'.When used with する verbs, sometimes
  the construction 仕方 is seen. This has exactly the same meaning as the form without kanji, and may be
  thought of as meaning 'way of dealing/attending to (A)', as 仕 's original meaning is 'to attend to (A)'.
  In these cases, the する verb is followed by の , and then 仕方 .Fun FactAfter attaching 方 to a verb, the
  entire expression is thought of as a noun-phrase. This means that it can be followed by particles such
  as は , を , and others, to create longer sentences.
