writeup: だけ is used in Japanese in a similar way to 'only' or 'just' in English. The basic meaning of
  this word is that 'while there are/were several possibilities, only (A) is true/was chosen'. だけ is used
  by attaching it to the base (dictionary) form of any word, except for な-Adjectives , which require な
  when being used adjectivally.Due to な-Adjectives being able to be used as either a noun or an adjective,
  the meaning of a sentence will be different depending on whether だけ is used with the noun form, or the
  adjective form.Basically this difference just highlights whether something is being discussed in a measurable
  way (an adjective), or an immeasurable way (a noun).
examples:
  - japanese: 一人だけです。
    english: Only one person.
  - japanese: それだけです。
    english: Only that.
  - japanese: サッカーだけが好き。
    english: I only like soccer.
  - japanese: 私だけ行きます。
    english: Only I am going.
  - japanese: その映画は長いだけ。
    english: That movie is just long.
