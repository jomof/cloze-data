writeup: ている is a construction used in Japanese to convey that someone or something is existing in a constant
  state of 'doing' the verb that comes before て . In English, depending on the verb, this can be translated
  as 'is (A)', 'am (A), or 'are (A)~ing'. The expression is made by adding いる to the て form of either
  る-Verbs , or う-Verbs .Due to いる being one of the verbs for 'existing' in Japanese, the ている form means
  something closer to 'continuing to exist in a specific state', rather than (A)~ing in English. This
  is why verbs like 死ぬ , and 知る , appear as the ている form in Japanese, when they would appear as the past
  form in English.
examples:
  - japanese: 何をしている？
    english: What are you doing?
  - japanese: 寿司を食べている。
    english: I am eating sushi.
  - japanese: 今、勉強していないよ。
    english: I am not studying now.
  - japanese: 彼は図書館で日本語を勉強しているだろう。
    english: He is studying Japanese at the library, right?
  - japanese: 私のお父さんが、高い時計をしています。
    english: My father is wearing an expensive watch.
