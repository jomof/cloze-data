writeup: There are several different ways to express 'if' in Japanese. One of these is through using theconjunction
  particleば.ばpresents hypothetical situations (possibilities), and pairs with verbs using an う to え sound-change
  conjugation method on the terminal (last) kana. Let's examine this with a few verbs first.As we can
  see with these verbs, the final kana will change to an え sound, from its original う (る to れ, う to え,
  く to け, す to せ, etc.) before addingば. It is important to practice these, to not get them mixed up with
  verbs that useれる, andられる. Unlike with these verbs, the base form ofするandくるwill not change when usingば.To
  conjugateい-Adjectiveswithば, the い will be replaced with けれ, one of the standardい-Adjectiveconjugation
  forms. After this, just addば.Forな-Adjectives, and nouns,なら(another standard conjugation form of these
  words) will be added, before attachingば.In the negative form (using ない), both theauxiliary verbない, and
  theい-Adjectiveない will conjugate in the same way. Simply replace い with けれ, and then addば.Fun FactTheならinならばis
  often used by itself to mean 'if', and is an abbreviation of theclassical auxiliary verbなり 'to be'.
  In itshypothesisform, なり will becomeならば. However, なり is very irregularly used by itself in modern Japanese,
  withなら, andならばbeing far more common.CautionSo that you do not mix up the conjugation rules forば, andpassiveverbs,
  remember that the last kana of the verb will change to an あ sound, before addingれるwithpassiveverbs.
  However, this change is to an え sound withば.
