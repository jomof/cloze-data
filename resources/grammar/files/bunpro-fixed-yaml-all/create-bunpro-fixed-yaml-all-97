writeup: Originally,かしらwas an abbreviation of か知らぬ, or かしらん, which are both ways of expressing 'whether
  it's (A), I don't know'. These days,かしらis a standalonesentence ending particlethat works in a similar
  way toかも, by expressing the speaker's uncertainty about the previous statement.かしらmay be attached to
  the end of almost any phrase that the speaker wants to express doubt about.CautionAlthough the original
  forms of か知らぬ, or かしらん were useable by anybody,かしらis thought to be very feminine in modern Japanese,
  and therefore is not often used by men.
