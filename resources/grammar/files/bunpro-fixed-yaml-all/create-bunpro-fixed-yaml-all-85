writeup: およそ or おおよそ, alternatively written as either凡そ or大凡is an adverb that commonly translates as 'approximately'
  or 'roughly' in English. It is primarily used in slightly more formal contexts, and can frequently be
  heard over announcements.As おおよそ is an adverb that is used in relation to time or distance more than
  anything else, it will usually be positioned at the beginning of sentences.Fun-fact - The kanji 凡 itself
  has the meaning of 'commonplace' and may also be translated as 'as a rule'. This just indicates that
  (A) is something that largely applies, but is not the case 100% of the time.
