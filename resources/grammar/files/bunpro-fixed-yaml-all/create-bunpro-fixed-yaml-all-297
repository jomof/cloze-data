writeup: だけでis a combination of theadverbial particleだけ, and thecase marking particleで. This expression
  is regularly thought of as meaning 'just by (A), (B)'. However, the literal translation is a bit closer
  to 'with only (A), (B)'. This reflects theでparticle's standard usage of showing a 'tool' that is being
  used to achieve a certain result.To useだけで, simply attach it to the end of any (non ます) form of verb,
  or noun.Fun Factだけdiffers fromしかin one very important way.だけhighlights that there is/was more than one
  option, but that only one thing was chosen/used. However,しかimplies that there is only one possible option
  to begin with.
