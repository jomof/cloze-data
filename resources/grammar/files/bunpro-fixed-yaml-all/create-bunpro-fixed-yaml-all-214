writeup: する verbs are one of only two main verbs in Japanese that do not follow the standard rules of
  conjugation for Godan and Ichidan verbs. The other primary verb being 来る . する means to do something,
  or to make something a certain way.する will almost always have the particle を attached to the thing that
  is being done (depending on the form of the verb). The reason that する verbs are called さ-column irregular
  conjugation verbs in Japanese is because the る in する does not conjugate, but is dropped.This will leave
  す to be the part that conjugates. Because of this, する has qualities of both る-Verbs (the る being dropped),
  and う-Verbs (the remaining す changing, depending on the conjugation). Here are some examples of how
  する changes.（さ）せる , （し）ます , （す）る , （せ）よ .We will learn more about each of these conjugations of する ,
  and their individual meanings at a later stage. For now, let's take a look at the polite します conjugation.In
  a broader sense, する can be thought of as meaning 'to do something that has an external effect'.
