writeup: かもしれないis an expression in Japanese that is often treated as a single word, but is actually the
  combination of theparticleかも, and thepotentialform of theう-Verb知る (to know) with theauxiliary verbない
  attached.かもしれないis regularly translated simply as 'might', or 'maybe', but the literal translation is
  much closer to 'even (A), we cannot know'.To useかもしれない, attach it to the end of any verb, noun,な-Adjectiveorい-Adjective,
  in their non-polite (keigo) forms.As theう-Verb知る is part of this construction, it may also be altered
  to its polite-potentialform, creatingかもしれません.Due toかもしれないbeing such a common grammar pattern in daily
  speech for expressing uncertainty about various things, several colloquial forms also exist. These areかも,かもしらん,
  andかもしれん.かもis by far the most common of these colloquial forms, withかもしらんpotentially sounding a little
  bit rough/boyish.
