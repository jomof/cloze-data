writeup: In Japanese, を is a particle that marks the object of an action. This means that the subject
  (the person or thing performing an action) is performing that action with the object being the goal/target
  of the action. In most cases, whatever を is attached to will not actually be 'doing' anything, but will
  instead have something being done to it.In these sentences, を is marking the thing that is having an
  action performed 'on' it. This is how the Japanese language views the ' object '. However, unlike English,
  an object can also be a place in which an action is performed 'through', if the goal of that action
  is based in that location itself.In these sentences, を is marking the place 'through' which the action
  is taking place. This use of を highlights that the place itself is what is being interacted with (running/walking
  requires interaction with the ground, so the ground/place is the object).
