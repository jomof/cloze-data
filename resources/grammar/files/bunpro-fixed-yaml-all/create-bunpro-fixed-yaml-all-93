writeup: One of the common uses of the particle か is often translated to 'or' in English. While this translation
  is accurate, it is not actually any different from か 's regular usage as a question marker.From these
  examples, we can see that, in Japanese, か is performing the same role that a question mark would, or
  that a change in tone of voice would in spoken language.'Would you like tea? coffee?' (said with a rising
  tone).This nuance of か can be used after the dictionary form of almost any word in Japanese. However,
  using です or ます will change the nuance from 'presenting possibilities', to 'asking a formal question',
  so should be avoided.
examples:
  - japanese: ここかそこ。
    english: Here or there?
  - japanese: ここのレストランかあそこのレストランでいい。
    english: This restaurant or that restaurant is good.
  - japanese: これは私のペンかあなたのペンですか。
    english: Is this my pen or your pen?
  - japanese: 赤か青。
    english: Red or blue.
  - japanese: 暇か忙しい。
    english: Free or busy.
