writeup: のです is a construction with several different forms, each meaning roughly the same thing. This
  expression behaves similarly to だ and です by themselves (asserting that something is true). However,
  the addition of の strengthens the relationship being highlighted. Due to this, it will come across a
  bit like 'it is a fact that (A)' in English.In these sentences, we can think of the ん , or の as simply
  adding emphasis to the statement. Due to の adding emphasis, this expression will be heard very frequently
  in explanations.CautionThere is no real difference between ん and の . Only の is considered 'correct Japanese',
  but ん evolved to make things easier to say. ん is the most common form in spoken Japanese, and the use
  of の could be considered a bit formal, or 'stiff'.While both the だ and です forms are equally as natural,
  only the です form will be used if adding か to the end ～んです か . This construction shows that the speaker
  is looking for an explanation about something.
