writeup: といえども is a combination of the case-marking particle と, the hypothetical form of 言 う, 言 え, and
  the conjunction particle ども, which is used in much the same way as けれども, or ても. Due to this, despite
  the more literal translation of 'even if one were to say (A)', it is usually translated simply as 'even
  if (A)', or 'although (A)'.といえども will be seen following nouns, い-Adjectives, or verbs in any of their
  standard form .といえども may also follow な-Adjectives, but だ will precede といえども in these cases.Despite the
  nuance being slightly different, といえども can be thought of as a very old-fashioned way of saying といっても.
  Due to といえども being old-fashioned, it is often used for emphasis and will frequently be paired with expressions
  like いくら, いかに, どんなに, etc.Fun FactAlthough very rarely used, sometimes いえども is seen as 雖 も. In these
  cases the kanji 雖 , which means 'however', is simply paired with も. This creates a slight difference
  between 'however even (A)', and the more modern 'even if one were to say (A)'. Despite this, the meanings
  are used interchangeably in modern times.
