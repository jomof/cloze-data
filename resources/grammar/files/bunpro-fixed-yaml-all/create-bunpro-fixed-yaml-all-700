writeup: ましょう is one of the conjugations of the auxiliary verb ます, and is a common (polite) way to suggest
  that something be done 'together' (when used with a verb). It is often translated as 'let's (A)', or
  'shall we (A)?'. To use ましょう , we will simply need to change ます to ましょう , when conjugating the verb.Despite
  regularly being translated as 'shall we (A)?', ましょう does not specifically target another person, and
  can also be used as a declaration that (A) will be done/needs to be done. This use reflects the base
  meaning of ましょう , which is the polite volitional form (deliberately/purposefully doing something).In
  this example, the speaker is expressing to themselves that they 'will' do something, and are strongly
  resolved to make it happen (similar to 'I shall' in English).
