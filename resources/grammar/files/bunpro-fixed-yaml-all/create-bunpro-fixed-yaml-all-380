writeup: で is a particle that has several different uses in Japanese. At its core, it is always used to
  highlight something that is ' required ' to perform some sort of action. One of these uses relates to
  places, and translates roughly as 'at', or 'in' in English.In these sentences, the place is considered
  essential for the action to be performed, or the result of the action to be achieved. This is unlike
  the particle に , which marks the location itself as being the destination or target of an action. Basically,
  で means (A) 'place' allows (B) 'action' to occur. While に means (A) 'place' is the target for (B) 'action'
  occurring.In the first example, we can see that に marks the place that the person exists during an action,
  but the action itself is not dependent on the place. In the second example, the action is considered
  dependent on being at that place, as there are possibly no barbeques in other areas.
