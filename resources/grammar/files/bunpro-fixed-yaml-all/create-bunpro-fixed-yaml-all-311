writeup: だろう is a conjugated form of だ , and can also be seen in the contracted form だろ (more casual).
  だろう expresses that the speaker thinks that something is true (assertion/expectation), and also that
  the listener would probably agree with them. This comes across like 'right?', or 'probably' in English.だろう
  carries exactly the same meaning as でしょう (the polite equivalent). However, due to だ being more casual
  than です , だろう is also considered to be more casual/masculine than でしょう .CautionWhile だろう is usually
  used when the speaker has some sort of information that would support their assertion, it can also be
  used simply when the speaker 'feels' that something is true.In this kind of sentence that expresses
  a 'feeling' or 'hunch', だろう comes across as quite low confidence. The speaker's tone of voice will often
  reveal how confident だろう is.
