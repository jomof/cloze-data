writeup: We have seen many cases now where theauxiliary verbようだmay be modified slightly to show that something
  is being done 'in a way' that will bring about a specific outcome. In this lesson, we will look at howような(when
  used with nouns), orように(when used with verbs) may be used with almost any noun/verb, to show that they
  are being done/existing in a particular manner.Sometimes, this structure is used purely to express the
  speaker's uncertainty about whether (B) really is being done/existing in the way of (A). In these cases,ように(orような)
  will be translated as 'as if', or 'as though'.
