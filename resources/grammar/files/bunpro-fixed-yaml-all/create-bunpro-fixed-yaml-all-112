writeup: から can have several different meanings in Japanese, depending on which part of the sentence it
  is in, and what comes before/after it. It is often translated as 'from'. In these cases, it just means
  'with (A) as a starting location, (B)'. In this grammar construction, から comes directly after the place
  that is considered the starting point.This form of から is the closest to the 'base' meaning of the word
  in Japanese, as the nuance of から can almost always be thought of as meaning 'from' in some way.CautionThis
  form of から does not require だ when used after nouns or な-Adjectives , as that would change the meaning
  to ' because '.
