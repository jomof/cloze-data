writeup: When usingだろう(the conjugated auxiliary verb) is grouped withか(the question particle), it presents
  the statement before it as something that the speaker is unsure about. In this way, it sounds similar
  to 'I wonder if (A)' in English.To use this construction, the statement beforeだろうかmust be nominalized
  (turned into a noun-phrase). This is done through the use ofの, orなの(in the case ofな-Adjectivesand nouns).Despite
  the grammatical rule relating to nominalization usingの(orなの), this part of the phrase is often omitted.だろうかis
  quite masculine, so in order to sound more polite/ladylike,でしょうかmay also be used instead.CautionAlthoughだろうかis
  quite masculine, it does not strictly mean thatでしょうかis feminine.でしょうかmay be used confidently by either
  women or men.Fun FactLikeだろう,だろうかmay be used to ask a question, or simply to express the speaker's inner
  thoughts.However,だろうかis most commonly used to express a personal 'I wonder', in a similar way toかな.
  Because of this, even if it is used as a question, the listener may assume that you are not specifically
  looking for an answer from them.
