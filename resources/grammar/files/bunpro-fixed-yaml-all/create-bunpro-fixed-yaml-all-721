writeup: も can mean 'too/also', or 'even', or 'neither/either', depending on if the sentence is affirmative
  or negative. Multiple meanings like this are quite common for Japanese particles, as there is no need
  to use different words simply to agree with other statements in the sentence (unlike English).As you
  can see here, English requires 'either/neither (when negative)', or 'too/also', but Japanese only requires
  も . You can think of it as simply meaning 'Whatever is true for (A), is also true for (B)'.も is part
  of many other compound grammar structures in which it keeps its original meaning, but shifts the nuance
  a little bit. Some of these include でも , にも～ない , とも . As we can see, it is frequently paired with other
  particles!Here, も can be seen pairing with で . This suggests that 'With (A), (B) also'. This is regularly
  translated simply as 'but' in English, despite the nuance being closer to 'and also'.

  - japanese: あなたもトムです。

  - japanese: 彼も先生です。

  - japanese: 彼女も可愛いです。
    english: She is also cute.
  - japanese: お母さんも元気です。
    english: My mom is also well. (Healthy, fine)
