writeup: One of the slightly more formal ways to say that something is happening 'each', or 'every' (A)
  in Japanese, is by using theprefix各. While there is no strict rule for when thisprefixcan be used, it
  is almost always seen before words of Chinese origin (kanji compounds), or katakana words.Although this
  kanji is used to mark 'each', it is very rarely used to mark units of time. The most common/natural
  usage of各is for identifying things that are part of a sequence. For example:Each/Every stop, on a train
  line that has many stops.Each/Every page, in a book that has many pages.Each/Every floor, in a building
  that has many floors.Each/Every house, in a street of many houses.Fun FactThis kanji is used in another
  word,各々, which also means 'each', but is primarily used for identifying people.
