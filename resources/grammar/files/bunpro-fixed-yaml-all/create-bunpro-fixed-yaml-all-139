writeup: To say that you want something in Japanese, theがparticle will be combined with theい-Adjective欲しい
  'to want (A)', or 'to desire (A)'. This is exactly the same way as otherい-Adjectivesbehave when describing
  nouns.CautionThis use of欲しい is only used for saying that you want 'things' (nouns). Theauxiliary verbたいwill
  be used when saying that you want to 'do' something (verbs).However, ほしい may be used with verbs to express
  that you want another person to do something. This is done through the use of ほしい after the conjunction
  particle,て.For more detail about this, please see ourてほしいlesson.
