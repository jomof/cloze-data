writeup: Coming from the base meaning of thenoun中meaning 'inside', the addition of thecase marking particleを
  in its role of identifying the place where an action is taking place creates a grammar structure that
  can be translated as 'doing (B) in (A)', 'doing (B) on (A)', or 'doing (B) inside of (A)'.With this
  grammar point, (B) will be the action, while (A) will be a noun indicating the location.Caution - The
  person or thing that is doing the action that中をis indicating may not actually be within the noun being
  marked with (A). A good example of this is 'doing (B) into (A)', such as with the う-Verb覗く 'to peer'.
