writeup: なさいis theimperative formof なさる, anhonorific languageverb which specifically highlights and respects
  the actions of another person (never the speaker).Despite being respectful, the fact that this is a
  'command' means that it would never be used toward a superior. Due to this,なさいis most frequently used
  toward peers, or people of lower status, like children.To useなさい, simply connect it to the ます stem of
  any verb.なさいmay be shortened further to な, which becomes an even more casual form that is used most
  frequently toward peers.CautionBe careful not to get confused between な (the particle), and な (the shortened
  form ofなさい). These can seem very similar, but な (meaning don't) will always be used with the dictionary
  form of a verb, while な (meaning please do) will always be used with the ます stem of a verb.
