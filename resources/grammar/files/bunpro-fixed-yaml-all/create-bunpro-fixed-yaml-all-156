writeup: 結構 is a な-Adjective that is actually used more frequently as a sentence altering adverb, than
  it is as a な-Adjective . What this means is that it is regularly used before an entire phrase (without
  な or だ ), and it will modify the entire sentence. The most common meaning that 結構 has is 'quite' (a
  bit/a lot).Fun Fact結構 is used very similarly in Japanese to 'no thank you', or 'I'm fine thanks' in
  English. For example, if someone asks you if you want to try a sample in a shop, most people would just
  say 結構 です .
examples:
  - japanese: 袋は結構です。
    english: I don't need a bag, thank you. (I'm fine without a bag)
  - japanese: いいえ、けっこうです。
    english: No thank you.
  - japanese: このカバンはけっこう高いです。
    english: This bag is quite expensive.
  - japanese: それはけっこう面白いですね
    english: That is quite interesting, isn't it.
  - japanese: 私は、けっこうです。
    english: No thank you. (I'm fine)
