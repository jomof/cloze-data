writeup: Likeとうとう,遂にis an adverb that is frequently used to mean 'finally', or 'at last'. It will usually
  come at the beginning of a sentence.遂にmay be seen equally as often with or without kanji. When compared
  to到頭, ついに is slightly more formal.CautionThe kanji遂has a meaning similar to 'to get (something) over
  with'. Due to this, ついに will most often be used to highlight things that have finally happened after
  a significant period of time, or a long course of events. It will not be used to express things that
  do not require time or effort.
