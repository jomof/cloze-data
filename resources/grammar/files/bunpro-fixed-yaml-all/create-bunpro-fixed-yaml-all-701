writeup: As covered in our ましょう lesson, ましょう is one of the conjugations of the auxiliary verb ます, and
  is a common (polite) way to suggest that something be done 'together'.Adding the particle か to this
  expression simply changes the nuance from 'let's', to 'shall we?', and is more of a direct question
  than ましょう by itself.Like ましょう , this expression can be added to the ます stem form of any verb.One thing
  to note with these examples is that they are 'suggestions', not 'invitations'. In Japanese there is
  a slight difference between the two, in the same way that there is in English. If you want to invite
  someone to do something, the most natural way would be to use ませんか , a phrase that is similar to ましょうか
  .The difference here is that 'won't you do (A)?' has a stronger nuance of being a direct invitation,
  while ましょうか is closer to just 'let's do (A)!'
examples:
  - japanese: 日本語で話しましょうか。
    english: Shall we speak in Japanese?
  - japanese: 明日ビーチに行きましょうか。
    english: Shall we go to the beach tomorrow?
  - japanese: インド料理を食べにいきましょうか。
    english: Shall we go and eat Indian food?
  - japanese: ９時前に帰りましょうか。
    english: Shall we go home before nine o'clock?
  - japanese: 図書館で勉強しましょうか。
    english: Shall we study at the library?
