writeup: In our second lesson about と , we will look at the common translation of 'with' that is associated
  with this particle. と shows that there is a relationship between (A) and (B), regardless of if that
  relationship is translated as ' and ', or ' with '.In either case, the nouns that are marked with と
  are usually all performing some mutual action (that mutual action may simply be existing).When と is
  used as 'with', it means that both/all people or objects are equally involved in the action. However,
  に highlights that one person is the target (destination) of an action, so will result in something sounding
  a lot more one sided.Here we can see that both people are talking when と is used. It is a mutual conversation.
  When に is used, however, the person marked by に is being talked 'to', and is usually not actively participating
  in the conversation.
