writeup: あれ , just like これ and それ , is one of several 'pronoun-like' words in Japanese ( substitute nouns
  ). あれ translates roughly to 'that' in English. However, unlike それ , あれ is used to highlight things that
  are away from both the speaker and the listener. Due to this, it is also often translated as 'that over
  there'.CautionBe careful not to mix upあれwith the common spoken expression あれ, which means 'huh?', or
  'oh?'. These are not the same words. The difference will usually be clear from context within a sentence,
  and the way the word is said. あれ as 'huh?' has a rising tone, and sounds like a question.
examples:
  - japanese: あれは何？
    english: What is that over there?
  - japanese: あれはコンビニです。
    english: That over there is a convenience store.
  - japanese: あれはホテルです。
    english: That over there is a hotel.
  - japanese: あれは、電車です。
    english: That over there is a train.
  - japanese: あれは、兄です。
    english: That over there is my older brother.
