writeup: Almost always written purely in hiragana,まさかis a combination of まさ, anounmeaning 'precise', or
  'exact', and theadverbial particleか. In modern Japanese,まさかis thought of as a singleadverbmeaning 'it
  can't be true', 'no way', or 'don't tell me'.As it is treated primarily as an adverb,まさかwill most often
  appear at the beginning of a sentence, before some statement about what the speaker is shocked/surprised
  about.Fun Factまさ comes from正, meaning 'precise' or 'actual'. However, this noun is very rarely used
  in modern Japanese. まさに is an adverb used to mean 'precisely', whileまさかis another adverb used to mean
  'no way!'. However, the literal meaning ofまさかis closer to 'is it true?', or 'is it actually?', due to
  か's role in creating questions.
