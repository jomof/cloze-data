writeup: ね is classified as a sentence ending particle in Japanese. It may also be pronounced as ねえ .
  ね is used when the speaker is looking for agreement from someone, or wants confirmation about something.
  Due to this, it is often translated as 'right?', or 'isn't it?'. To use ね , simply add it to the end
  of almost any sentence.As we will cover in our lesson about the sentence ending particle な , ね can almost
  be thought of as the opposite. ね is used when expressing a shared opinion, a shared thought, or generally
  something you think will be agreed with by the listener. However, な focuses almost exclusively on the
  speaker, and their own thoughts.Fun Factよ and ね are very frequently combined together to make the sentence
  ender よ ね . This is used purely when you expect the listener will agree with you.Cautionね is much weaker
  than でしょう or だろう , and is sometimes said purely out of habit, without much nuance of 'right' at all.
