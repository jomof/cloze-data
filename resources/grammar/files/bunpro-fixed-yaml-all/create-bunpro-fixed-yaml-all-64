writeup: In order to mark something as 'equal to, or less than (A)',以下will be used. This is simply a combination
  of the kanji以which means 'by means of', and下'below'. This expression may also be translated as 'under
  (A)', or 'fewer than (A)'.To use以下, attach it to the amount that you want to highlight as the 'maximum'
  amount.Similarly to the way that以上can be used to mark 'everything up until now',以下can and often is used
  to highlight 'everything after now', 'the rest', or 'the following'.
