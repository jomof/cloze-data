writeup: When used in the negative,てくれない(coming fromてくれる),  andてもらえない(coming fromてもらえる), are similar to
  the negative question form ofじゃないか. They express the following:てくれない- Would you not do (A) for me?てもらえない-
  Could I not have you do (A) for me?In both of these constructions.か(the question particle) may be omitted.
  However, they do sound slightly more polite whenかis used.Let's examine the following list, for a scale
  of the level of politeness.てくれ,てくれる,てもらえる,てくれない（か）,てもらえない（か）CautionDespite the above list,てくれmay be
  considered a bit rude, and should be avoided in most situations.
