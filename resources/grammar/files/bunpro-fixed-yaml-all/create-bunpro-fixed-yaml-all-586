writeup: に代わって is an expression that will only appear with nouns, conveying that (B) is doing something
  'in place of (A)', or 'on behalf of (A)'. This is a combination of thecase marking particleに, the う
  - Verb代わる 'to substitute', and theconjunction particleて.に代わり may also be used, as this is the formal
  conjunctive. Also known as theconjunctive form.Fun FactIn this construction,にis acting as a location
  marker, rather than specifically meaning 'for (A)'. What this means is that に代わる is the act of removing
  (A) from its place, and exchanging it for (B). This is why に代わって may also be used in the meaning of
  'to succeed', or 'to replace', as switching (A) to (B) may be permanent.
