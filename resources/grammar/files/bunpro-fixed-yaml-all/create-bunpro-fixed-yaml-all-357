writeup: てすみませんis a grammar construction that expresses the speaker's regret about (A). It is often translated
  directly to 'I'm sorry for (A)'. As discussed in one of our previous lessons onて, we examined the 'since',
  or 'due to' meaning that it can have. Let's look at a few examples.Phrases that use this particular
  (A)て(B) nuance of theて-formprimarily express something that is beyond the control of the speaker in
  the (B) statement. Coming from the verb済む (to finish), すみません (the negated form) means 'to be unfinished'.
  In this way,てすみませんliterally means that the speaker feels that something is 'unfinished due to (A)'.
  This is very similar to phrases like 'having unfinished business' in English.Although the translation
  is 'I'm sorry', perhaps it would be easier to remember this grammar structure as highlighting someone's
  regret/unfinished feelings about (A), and simply showing that to the person that is being apologized
  to.
