writeup: In Japanese, the non-past form of verbs is identical to the dictionary form/casual form. Unlike
  English, this form of verbs is able to be used in several cases where conjugation/different constructions
  would be required in English.In these examples, we can see the three forms of English verbs that are
  covered by the single non-past form of Japanese verbs. These are verbs ending with -s (sees, hears,
  goes), verbs requiring will (will see, will hear, will go), and verbs that do not require conjugation
  (see, hear, go).Due to this one form of verbs covering several different nuances, it is often important
  to use expressions of time in the sentence, so that the meaning becomes clear.If there is no word distinguishing
  'time' in the sentence, the nuance will be that of stating a general fact about something that is true
  at any time.From all of these examples, we can see that the non-past form can be thought of as expressing
  one of three basic ideas. General facts, habits, or future events.CautionIn books, the non-past form
  will regularly be used for events that are happening 'in the moment', but without any time word being
  used. In these cases it is usually obvious from context that it is happening then and there.
examples:
  - japanese: 私は９時にバナナを食べる。私は９時にバナナを食べます。
    english: I will eat a banana at 9 o'clock. (future event)
  - japanese: ヴァンパイアは血を飲む。ヴァンパイアは血を飲みます。
    english: Vampires drink blood. (general truth)
  - japanese: たなかさんは毎週車を洗う。たなかさんは毎週車を洗います。
    english: Tanaka-san washes the car every week. (habit)
  - japanese: 生徒は習う。生徒は習います。
    english: Students take lessons. (general truth)
  - japanese: 明日、焼きそばを食べる。明日、焼きそばを食べます。
    english: Tomorrow I will eat fried noodles. (future event)
